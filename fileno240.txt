On the way to the Transportation Department, Xu Qing passed by the Sixth Peak's shop that had tried to scam him back then and stopped before the entrance.Almost at the instant he stopped, the expressions of the shopkeeper and staff in the shop changed drastically. They quickly ran out and knelt down, trembling."Greetings, Senior."Xu Qing coldly looked at the shopkeeper in front of him.Cold sweat dripped from the shopkeeper's forehead to the ground. His back was completely drenched and he was terrified.He was feeling an intense life-and-death crisis.He never dreamed that this Xu Qing would actually reach the Foundation Building realm… Previously, he was only afraid of the second highness of the Seventh Peak and didn't care much about Xu Qing.After all, as a shopkeeper and a follower of the Sixth Peak's Deacon Leisure Cloud, not many piedmont disciples dared to touch him. However, if the other party was also a Foundation Building cultivator… He didn't think that his master would be willing to become enemies with a Foundation Building cultivator for him.While he shivered in fear and uncertainty, Xu Qing retracted his gaze and left.After he left, the shopkeeper lay there paralyzed. He felt as though he had traveled back and forth between life and death.Xu Qing didn't kill him because it was expensive.In addition, he didn't want to alert the main target. After all, Xu Qing had long dug out the name of Leisure Cloud from the Diamond Sect's ancestor and even carved it on his bamboo slip.However, he hadn't found an opportunity yet.Putting this matter aside, Xu Qing finally understood why he hadn't encountered many Foundation Building cultivators at the foot of the mountain previously. It was because the appearance of Foundation Building cultivators caused too many waves.Wherever they went, countless gazes would gather.Unless one was a high-profile person, this state would make one feel extremely uncomfortable. This was more so for Xu Qing who liked to move in the darkness. He couldn't and didn't want to adapt to being stared at by so many people.In reality, the Foundation Building cultivators of the Seventh Peak were all gloomy people who had killed their way out from below the mountain. Naturally, they didn't like such attention."How do the others do it?" Xu Qing fell silent as he made a guess.While thinking, Xu Qing sped up and headed straight for the Transportation Department. He had already sent a voice transmission to Zhang San earlier, and knew that the latter had already returned and was in the Transportation Department.As such, when Xu Qing arrived at the Transportation Department, he saw Zhang San in a gray Daoist robe from afar and the captain who had grown his lower body and was also wearing a gray Daoist robe. The handymen working in the Transportation Department couldn't sense any difference in the two of them. However, Xu Qing, who had advanced to the Foundation Building realm, had a much stronger perception than before. He could tell at a glance that the two of them had advanced to the Foundation Building realm, but had restrained their auras.They were squatting on the sandbags. One of them was smoking a pipe and the other was eating an apple. When the sunlight landed on them, it illuminated their gray Daoist robes with some gorgeous colors.Xu Qing's arrival attracted their attention. After noticing Xu Qing's purple Daoist robe, the captain revealed a smug expression while Zhang San sighed."You lost," the captain said happily to Zhang San.Zhang San took out a spirit stone and handed it to the captain.When Xu Qing saw this scene, he was certain of his guess about the Foundation Building going down the mountain."Xu Qing, why did you wear the purple robe? Foundation Building cultivators on our Seven Blood Eyes Mountain don't wear purple robes unless it's something major. It's too conspicuous."Zhang San smiled honestly, his face filled with friendliness. Even though he had reached the Foundation Building realm now, he still couldn't forget Xu Qing's cruelty in the competition. Hence, his attitude was very enthusiastic and he also told Xu Qing the reason why he and the captain weren't wearing purple robes."Hurry up and change when you get back. Also, don't stay on the mountain all the time. It's so lonely on the mountain. Have you realized that there aren't many Foundation Building cultivators living on the mountain? Let me tell you, most of them are wearing gray robes and living at the foot of the mountain while hiding their auras. The main city is prosperous and lively, and many things are convenient here."Xu Qing nodded seriously.As for the captain, he had a spurious smile on his face as he glanced at Xu Qing.

Not many people on our Seventh Peak are like Deacon Li, flying around in his purple robe all day. Even then, he only started doing this after he followed Elder Zhao. As for Zhang Yunshi, that's a job requirement. I heard that he likes to receive newbies.""Also…" At this point, the captain took a big bite of the apple and coughed."Deputy Director Xu, when are you going to return the 10,000 spirit stones you owe <anno data-annotation-id="669bed76-eabd-462d-aef2-efd41ccc9f71">me</anno>?"When Xu Qing heard this, he glanced at the captain. Even with his Foundation Building cultivation, he still couldn't see the depths of the other party's cultivation."Director?" Xu Qing asked."That's right. After I returned, I was appointed as a director of the Homicide Department. Deputy Director Xu, you have to hurry up and earn spirit stones. I've been a little tight on money recently."A hint of pride appeared on the captain's face as he looked at Xu Qing, wanting to see Xu Qing's envy."Congratulations, Captain." Xu Qing glanced at the captain's complete body. This time, he didn't need the other party to remind him before he responded."Haha, Deputy Director Xu, I'm happy that you're chatting like this. However, I have to correct you. You need to call me Director.""Alright, Captain." Xu Qing nodded."Director!" The captain fiercely took a bite of the apple and corrected him."Mm." Xu Qing nodded and took out three large apples from his pocket, giving one to the captain and Zhang San each.Zhang San smiled."The two of you, stop arguing. Xu Qing, I've finished refining your magic boat. I'll bring you to take a look later. Sigh, this time, all three of us were able to reach the Foundation Building realm. Thinking about it, it really feels like a lifetime has passed.""I didn't expect that I, Zhang San, would one day reach the Foundation Building realm. I heard that after the competition ended, many people advanced to the Foundation Building realm. Ding Xiaohai also reached the Foundation Building realm some time ago." Zhang San sighed with emotion."Tell me if he's not stupid. Others risk their lives to get rich but he risked his life for a lousy core disciple status. In the end, he reached the Foundation Building realm as soon as he obtained it. He got the core disciple for nothing." The captain ate the big apple Xu Qing gave him and said with a look of disbelief."You two, don't be like him. I am not worried about Deputy Director Xu, this guy only wants to get rich and won't act rashly. But Zhang San, you have to be careful.""I have something to tell you guys. I've been thinking about a big plan recently and I'm currently collecting information. Once I'm done preparing, I'll bring you guys to do a big job. This time, it'll be even more exciting than snatching Binding's flesh."The captain put on a mysterious expression and madness flickered in his eyes.Zhang San immediately became vigilant, and so did Xu Qing."What kind of expressions are you two wearing?" The captain glared."I will stop here. I still have to gather information. However, your cultivation levels are too low. You have to form a life lantern as soon as possible and have the ability to activate the Mystic Brilliance Form; otherwise, you won't be able to participate in my plan." The captain stood up."What exactly is the Mystic Brilliance Form?" Xu Qing asked. After he reached the Foundation Building realm, he had heard the mention of Mystic Brilliance Form many times. Although he understood it in theory, he had never seen it before.Zhang San also looked at the captain curiously. Clearly, he didn't know much about this. After all, when he was in Qi Condensation, he had even fewer contacts with Foundation Building cultivators."You want to know?" The captain swept his gaze across Xu Qing and Zhang San and smiled."Forget it. Seeing that the two of you are my future teammates, I'll tell you guys. Do you know why I went to get Binding's flesh? This is because after swallowing enough of the flesh of a divine creature of that level, it can instantly open up a lot of magic apertures, allowing me to form a ball of life fire.""I won't explain what the Mystic Brilliance Form is. I'll just show you."As the captain spoke, an earth-shattering sound erupted from his body. This sound was like heavenly lightning. As it rumbled in all directions, an extremely terrifying aura suddenly spread from his body.Xu Qing's expression changed and he quickly retreated. His eyes stared fixedly at the captain in front of him and shock surfaced in his eyes.At that moment, a huge stove that had been ignited appeared in the captain's body. Waves of fiery power erupted from his body and spread in all directions. The intensity of the fluctuations coming from his body seemed to have been enhanced by at least several times.He seemed to be burning. The phantom behind him was earth-shattering, causing one's eyes to feel a faint piercing pain. In fact, the surroundings were distorted.His body moved abruptly at this moment.Xu Qing could only see an afterimage. In that instant, he felt his mind buzzing. The intense life-and-death crisis caused him to instinctively retreat at full speed. However, it was still too late.The captain's body arrived beside him and his right hand was placed in front of him.In his hand was a strand of Xu Qing's hair. At that moment, it rapidly distorted under the high temperature and turned into ashes.Xu Qing's eyes abruptly narrowed. The stove in the captain's body instantly extinguished and he returned to normal. He then smiled at Xu Qing."Deputy Xu, if I wanted to kill you just now, you would be dead."Xu Qing's breathing was hurried. Waves of emotions were surging in his mind. Previously, his understanding of the Mystic Brilliance Form was all verbal and jade slip descriptions. Now that he saw it for himself, the impact was extremely intense.At that instant just now, the feeling he got from his captain was that he couldn't fight against him."Of course, I'm a genius. Other people who have activated their Mystic Brilliance Form won't be as powerful as me, but you won't be able to defeat them either. This is because the Mystic Brilliance Form is a super eruption of the magic apertures in their bodies. At that moment, their spells, and body will be strengthened to an extreme. Although it can't last long, it's barely enough for them to kill or escape."The captain spoke proudly."Only cultivators in the Mystic Brilliance Form can resist other cultivators in the Mystic Brilliance Form.""Foundation Building cultivators who haven't activated their Mystic Brilliance Form are just chickens.""So, children, don't get the wrong understanding of Foundation Building due to some random chicken you saw in the past.""You have to work hard. Remember to return the 20,000 spirit stones you owe me quickly."As the captain spoke, he ate the apple and left. After taking a few steps, he stepped into the air and transformed into a stream of light. His destination wasn't the mountain peak but the Homicide Department.Xu Qing silently looked at the departing figure of the captain. At this moment, the sense of danger was unprecedentedly intense and his mind was filled with urgency. He had to open 30 magic apertures as soon as possible and form his life fire. From there, he would also possess this Mystic Brilliance Form!Zhang San was also silent. After a long time, he smiled bitterly and shook his head."The captain is a madman… Let's go, I'll show you your magic boat."Xu Qing didn't say anything. He retracted his gaze from the departing figure of the captain and followed silently. However, the rising feeling in his heart grew increasingly intense.'Once I form my life fire, with the enhancement of the life lantern, it will be the same as having two balls of life fire!'Xu Qing took a deep breath. Under this sense of urgency, he followed Zhang San to the warehouse. As the warehouse opened, a huge magic ship that was somewhat familiar appeared in front of him.The 500-foot-long boat was covered in Foundation Building sea lizard skin, and its appearance had also changed. What appeared in Xu Qing's eyes was no longer the alligator turtle from back then but a sea lizard!The aura of divinity was extremely intense, the wings of the magic boat also had changed appearance, turning into fleshy wings that grew on both sides of the sea lizard's body.Cruelty and violence assaulted his senses."Xu Qing, the captain divided the flesh of Binding into a small portion for you and me. I added it in your boat to use as the core power source, allowing the magic boat to be promoted to a true magic ship!"Of course, if you don't want to, you can still take it away. However, I think it's better to put it on the ship. With this ship, your survivability in the Forbidden Sea will increase greatly!"<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="669bed76-eabd-462d-aef2-efd41ccc9f71">He calls himself director here.</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 212 Depends On Your Fate
Looking at the sea lizard magic ship in front of him, Xu Qing's heart stirred.He had seen Foundation Building sea lizards before.It was because he had seen them before that after seeing his magic ship refined into the appearance of a sea lizard by Zhang San, he examined it with his perception. Although his magic ship was still a little different from a real sea lizard, its aura was almost the same.It was 500-foot-long, four limbs with sharp nails, a lifelike head, and a tail that was still swaying slightly behind it.It was exactly the same as the sea lizards.The difference was that it had flesh wings.The wings were very large. Xu Qing estimated that they would be at least as long as the body of the ship when they unfolded. He could imagine that once they flapped, they would definitely cause violent winds to howl.The location of the cabin was on the back of the sea lizard. It was a three-story building. It didn't look exquisite but gave off a sense of sturdiness."The magic boats of the Seventh Peak are divided into four types: boat, ship, warship, and liner. Your boat has advanced to the level of a magic ship and has reached level three. However, because of the divine lizard's molt and Binding's flesh, part of its might far exceeds its normal power."Zhang San glanced at Xu Qing's shocked expression and felt extremely comfortable. He lifted his chin proudly and spoke while looking at the masterpiece in front of him."The areas that are lacking are the keel, some of the materials on the magic boat, and the core power source. Although Binding's flesh is rare and powerful, the captain gave too little. Moreover, the divinity inside has no roots, so if you have a way to obtain the heart of a divine creature, the value of this magic ship will be even greater.""The prices of the materials for the Foundation Building magic ship far exceed Qi Condensation magic boat's. Moreover, the components needed for the magic ship are also more complicated. Basically, to advance the level of the magic ship just by one level even with the most inferior Foundation Building materials would cost 30,000 to 50,000 spirit stones.""If it was a high-level material like your Foundation Building sea lizard skin, it would cost at least 150,000 to advance one level. I can't afford it… If you want to use even higher quality materials, the price will be astronomical. So, if you want to advance your magic ship, you have to earn money, Xu Qing.""The reason why the Foundation Building magic ship is astonishing is because after reaching the eighth level, it will possess a special ability that is related to the Mystic Brilliance Form of cultivators. However, its function is to suppress the enemy's Mystic Brilliance Form. The better the materials of the boat, the greater the suppression effect!"Xu Qing's heart stirred.Previously, when the captain activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, it made him feel intense urgency. Now that he heard about the might of the magic ship, his eyes lit up."Are you surprised? Otherwise, why would the cultivators of the Seventh Peak still work hard to advance their magic ships after reaching the Foundation Building realm? You have to know that outsiders call us cultivators of Seventh Peak as boat cultivators," Zhang San said with a smile."Also, considering that half of your magic boat collapsed previously, I've prioritized the ship's sturdiness and defense this time. Now, your magic ship is much more powerful than before.""Regardless of whether it's sea navigation, flight, or diving into the sea, the ship is outstanding in all aspects.""I even added a layer of outer shell to the ship. The inspiration came from the sea lizard molt. Once your magic ship encounters an unbearable attack, its outer shell will shatter into pieces like a flower. It will look extremely miserable. This way, others probably won't be willing to use their magic power a second time.""In reality, it can be reassembled with a thought from you. However, I'm not very proficient in this skill yet, so you can't do it many times. From my estimation, your ship can support two disintegrations and reassemblies.""At that time, regardless of whether you pretend to be dead or wait to counterattack, you will catch the enemy off guard."Xu Qing looked at Zhang San and then at his magic ship. He could sense that Zhang San had poured his heart to refine it. Such sincerity was very precious in the Seven Blood Eyes' environment.Xu Qing cupped his fists and bowed deeply."Thank you, Senior Brother!""There's no need to be polite. This is also an investment. From the looks of it, I made the right investment in you and the captain. So, I also hope that you can survive longer. After all… I think both of you are quite crazy, but I predict that the captain will die faster than you." Zhang San sighed.Xu Qing hesitated for a moment before asking."Are the coffin materials prepared for the captain still in my magic ship?""Yes. They are good things. I used some of it last time, so I can't waste the rest." Zhang San coughed and smiled at Xu Qing.Xu Qing didn't say anything and cupped his fists again. After some thought, he took out 20,000 spirit stones and handed them over. Zhang San didn't stand on ceremony. He used more than these materials for this refinement. After he kept them, he waved at Xu Qing and the two of them bade farewell.Xu Qing kept his magic ship and looked at the distant sea, his heart filled with anticipation.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  "I'll head out to sea tomorrow morning!" After Xu Qing made his decision, he left the Transportation Department. On the way, he was also calculating his spirit stones."I spent too much on the breakthrough to Foundation Building. Right now, I have less than 50,000 spirit stones. I have to sell the Spirit Breath Lantern as soon as possible. Once I sell it, I'll be rich."Xu Qing pondered and flew all the way to the Seventh Peak. It was already dark and there were no longer any pedestrians in the main city. The streets were empty and only the malice in the night spread among the piedmont disciples.However, this had nothing to do with Xu Qing now. Just killing wanted criminals wasn't enough for him. However, when his figure flew halfway through the main city, he suddenly stopped in mid-air.Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at the empty street below. There was a person lying there.It was a youth wearing a gray robe with a dog-skin coat underneath. Blood had soaked through the coat and dyed his Daoist robe black. One could see a fatal wound on his abdomen.His exposed body was also covered in injuries.All his fingernails had been plucked out forcefully, along with his serrated, sharp teeth.It was the mute.His injuries were severe and he was on the verge of death. There was an identity token on his chest and there were very few contribution points left. According to the time, the moment dawn broke, he would probably be killed by the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation.Xu Qing looked at the mute and silently descended. He stood beside the mute youth and looked at him.The mute was already unconscious and looked like he would die before dawn broke. The pouch was gone along with his magic boat.Xu Qing knew that this method of causing the target to be on the verge of death and keeping the token on their chest was a common method used by many disciples at the foot of the mountain. They usually used this method to take revenge.It was obvious that the mute was too cruel, so someone took revenge on him.Looking at the mute, Xu Qing thought of the actions of the other party; offering him wanted criminals, following him after he returned from the competition that day, and that reminder regarding the shadow.After a long time, Xu Qing picked up the mute's identity token and transferred one spirit stone's contribution points over. He pried open the mute's badly mangled mouth and threw in a pill.After doing all this, he grabbed the mute's clothes and dragged him away. When he arrived at the other party's kennel-like residence, Xu Qing threw the mute inside.He could already be considered extremely benevolent for doing all these in this chaotic world. As for life and death, it was up to fate. Whether the mute could survive depended on his luck.Xu Qing left. He knew that the mute had woken up on the way but he didn't care.After he left, the mute youth opened his eyes with great difficulty. He stared at Xu Qing's departing figure. After a long time, he closed his eyes again and curled up into a ball.Xu Qing returned to the Seventh Peak. When he saw his cave abode from afar, he noticed a familiar figure sitting beside the cliff outside his cave abode.It was Huang Yan.He sat on the cliff with his legs dangling and an egg in his hand. He was drinking happily while shaking his head. When he noticed Xu Qing's figure flying over, Huang Yan's eyes lit up and he immediately waved his hand."Haha, you're finally back. I've been waiting for you for a while now." As he spoke, Huang Yan took out an egg and threw it over.Xu Qing caught it and landed beside him. He didn't act any different from before just because he was at the Foundation Building realm. He also sat down and broke the egg to take a sip.It still tasted the same."I heard someone say yesterday that you've reached the Foundation Building realm, so I came to see you today. Ain't I amazing? I can ascend the Seventh Peak whenever I want. Even the array formation doesn't stop me," Huang Yan said proudly."Second highness treats you very well." Xu Qing smiled. He had a good impression of Huang Yan. If he were to consider who his friends were among the people he met on the Seventh Peak, Huang Yan could be considered one.At the mention of the second highness, the little fatty immediately patted his chest loudly."Naturally. Let me tell you, Senior Sister is very good to me now. She even gave me a token so that I can look for her anytime."Xu Qing smiled and continued to drink the egg.Just like that, under the moonlight, the two of them were like how they were in Port 79. Xu Qing mostly listened while Huang Yan kept telling him how his senior sister treated him.An hour later, Huang Yan stood up and patted the dust off his butt as he smiled at Xu Qing."By the way, Xu Qing, I came here for something else. I heard that you took away the merfolk race's Spirit Breath Lantern. Do you want to sell it to me? I intend to give it to Senior Sister.""I won't take advantage of you. I'll buy it for 500,000 spirit stones but I don't have that much now. I need a month to get them. If you agree, it's settled." Huang Yan looked at Xu Qing expectantly.Xu Qing thought about it and nodded in agreement.Huang Yan was very happy. Before he left, he seemed to have thought of something and his expression became a little more serious."Xu Qing, I heard from Senior Sister that something major will happen in the sect in the near future!""During the battle of the merfolk race back then, the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor broke through and killed his way into the Sea Corpse Race to establish his might. I'm afraid there will be a follow-up to this matter. After all… his cultivation is now different and the power situation in the sea area has to be shuffled again.""There might even be a war. This is a good thing. Every war is the same as the competition. It's an opportunity for us to make a fortune. It's just more dangerous but the harvest will also be greater." After Huang Yan finished speaking, he bade farewell and left.Xu Qing looked at Huang Yan's departing back and then at the sea."War…"

Chapter 213 Fishing For A Dragon
Xu Qing had never experienced war before but he had seen something similar.However, the difference in levels was huge.What he saw was a battle between the small city where the slums were located and other cities. This battle lasted for seven to eight days."In that case, how long will the war between the Seven Blood Eyes and the foreign forces last?" The scenes from the merfolk competition appeared in Xu Qing's mind.The captain was right about one thing. Such a major event wasn't something they should worry about. The important figures of the sect were the ones who would lead everything."I will not participate in the war unless the benefits are enough." Xu Qing walked back to the cave abode. When he sat down, he took out the jade slip of the Life Art.  n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  Although the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art was also a cultivation art, it was mostly cultivated through slaughter. To a certain extent, it wasn't much different from a spell. After cultivating it, as the magic apertures were opened, there would also be corresponding spell moves.As for the Life Art, it was different. It purely relied on cultivators to absorb the spirit energy of heaven and earth to cultivate. It was similar to the Sea Transformation Art and slowly strengthened oneself, grinding open one magic aperture after another.Xu Qing felt that his previous thoughts were a little wrong. These two cultivation arts could actually be cultivated together. It wasn't important which was the master and which was the supplementary. This was because everything at the Foundation Building realm was about opening the magic apertures to form life fire.At that moment, he began to cultivate the Life Art.The night passed.The next day, when the sun rose, Xu Qing opened his eyes as the sunlight fell like flames.He calmly arranged his weapons, poison powder, and the talismans he had bought. After that, he suppressed his shadow as usual before opening the cave abode's door. He looked at the blue sky and white clouds in the distance that were illuminated red like a vast stove."I have to go out to sea and kill the sea beasts to obtain their souls to open my magic apertures."Xu Qing stepped into the air. The plesiosaur manifested under him and roared at the sky. Its four flippers swayed slightly, as though the sky was an ocean, and erupted with an astonishing speed as it brought Xu Qing straight toward the horizon.The black waves surged and ebbed in the Endless Sea.Compared to the brightness of the sky, this black color of the sea exuded a dense strangeness. It was like ink and because of its depth and unknownness, one couldn't help but feel fear and reverence.Although this wasn't his first time out at sea, Xu Qing's mood wasn't much different from before. In fact, he was even more cautious.This was because there were rules in the sect but outside the sect… anything was possible.As such, Xu Qing didn't fly ostentatiously. Instead, he took out the magic ship and activated its concealment, making it appear ordinary. He then activated its protective barriers."The ship is more comfortable than the cave abode." Xu Qing sat on the boat and sighed with emotion. He controlled the magic ship to head straight for an area he had chosen.He had been to that area before. It was the place where he had encountered the plesiosaur with Zhao Zhongheng and Ding Xue.This was because his hunting target was… the plesiosaur.To break through the magic apertures, he needed souls. Since he had decided to use the souls of sea beasts as fuel, the plesiosaur that had shown vicious intent toward him back then would naturally become his first choice.He was aware that it was impossible for him to encounter the same one. However, that area was frequented by plesiosaurs, so it was a good destination to search for them.As Xu Qing sailed, he cultivated the Life Art, not wasting any time. He also stored his plesiosaur in his magic aperture.His plesiosaur's aura was at the Foundation Building realm. If it was allowed to roam outside, Xu Qing was worried that with the cautious nature of the wild plesiosaurs, they wouldn't reveal themselves.He also saw some boats that weren't from the Seven Blood Eyes. Every time he encountered them, Xu Qing would be on guard. Although he was now at the Foundation Building realm, his vigilance didn't decrease at all.Most of the people who encountered unfamiliar boats on the sea were the same. Both sides would be on guard against each other until they left each other's range.Time flowed by. Three days later, Xu Qing finally arrived at that sea area. It was noon and seabirds were flying in the sky, their cries spreading long and far.Xu Qing sat on the deck and looked at the black Forbidden Sea. He spread out his perception and paid attention to the fluctuations under the sea.However, there was no sign of a plesiosaur even after he waited for a long time.Xu Qing fell silent for a moment and restrained the aura of the magic ship. He observed the sky, and a while later, he locked onto a pseudotooth bird circling in the surroundings for food.With a wave of his hand, the black iron stick instantly flew out of his hand and headed straight for the sky. The pseudotooth bird was shocked and wanted to escape, but it was still too late. Its wings were penetrated by the black iron stick.Amidst the pseudotooth bird's cries, Xu Qing controlled the black iron stick to bring it over. He made the black stick hold it above the surface of the sea, making it impossible for it to escape no matter how it struggled. Xu Qing waited warily.Time slowly passed. As the pseudotooth bird struggled and showed signs of weakness, Xu Qing's eyes suddenly narrowed. He sensed an undercurrent surging over from the bottom of the sea. Not long later, a plesiosaur that was even more majestic than last time and was over 3,000 feet long revealed its figure.Its aura was astonishing, between Qi Condensation and Foundation Building. However, with its enormous body, its combat strength was no longer something that Qi Condensation cultivators could resist. As it got closer, it noticed Xu Qing's magic ship.However, Xu Qing's magic ship's aura was completely restrained, not revealing anything. It was the same for himself. Hence, after the plesiosaur circled the surroundings, it got close.It didn't break through the surface of the sea to devour the pseudotooth bird. Instead, it charged fiercely toward Xu Qing's magic ship.To it, Xu Qing… looked even more delicious than the pseudotooth bird.Xu Qing didn't bat an eyelid. When the other party got close enough, a chill erupted in his eyes. He suddenly grabbed at the approaching plesiosaur.Immediately, the seawater around the plesiosaur rumbled and a large hand formed by seawater and Foundation Building magic power rose. It grabbed at the plesiosaur.The black iron stick quickly penetrated the pseudotooth bird's body and headed straight for the sea. The Diamond Sect's ancestor who wanted to show his worth was currently working extremely hard. He broke into the sea and quickly rushed toward the plesiosaur.The plesiosaur let out a roar, forming a sound wave that pierced through the seawater and stopped the black iron stick. At the same time, its flippers swayed rapidly, creating a large wave in the sea in an attempt to counterattack the large hand that had grabbed it. It was already alarmed and wanted to retreat.However, it was too late. The large hand did not loosen up no matter how it struggled. The black iron stick gave off a bright light at this moment; it broke through the sound waves and directly pierced into the plesiosaur's body. It swam rapidly through its flesh and blood, heading straight for its heart."I want it alive!"Xu Qing calmly spoke. The black iron stick trembled. Although it had stabbed into the plesiosaur's heart, it didn't dare to penetrate it and remained motionless.With its heart pierced, even though it was a very small wound like a needle hole to the plesiosaur, the intense pain still made it roar. It struggled intensely but it could not escape. The large hand formed by the seawater lifted it into the air.The seawater cascaded down like a waterfall. The plesiosaur's huge body blocked the sunlight in the air, causing the shadow to envelop Xu Qing's magic ship.Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the plesiosaur in front of him. He calmly began to perform hand seals. The black fire in the magic apertures in his body slowly rose.From afar, Xu Qing's entire body was covered in black flames. The rising flames caused terror to appear in the plesiosaur's eyes. It let out an intense roar and struggled even more intensely.However, it was useless. Very soon, more and more black flames rose from Xu Qing's body. In the end, they spread out and transformed into a demon-like phantom. It let out a sinister laugh as it pounced toward the plesiosaur.The moment they came into contact, the demon's body instantly spread out along the plesiosaur's body, instantly enveloping it and starting to burn it.What it was burning wasn't the plesiosaur's body but its soul.The entire process lasted for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. As the plesiosaur's struggles and roars grew weaker and weaker, the black flames on its body suddenly curled back and fused into Xu Qing's body.The plesiosaur's body instantly went limp with no signs of life. After losing its soul, its body lost its spirituality and value.The large hand loosened up and the plesiosaur's body fell into the sea loudly, causing huge waves to rise.The black iron stick quickly flew out of the plesiosaur's body and obediently circled around Xu Qing.This was the first time Xu Qing had used the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art. He was inspecting his body, and saw a small ball of white soul shadow with some green in it had appeared in his body.This soul shadow looked like a plesiosaur."It's indeed white." Xu Qing mumbled. According to the description of the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, the souls of Qi Condensation cultivators were white and Foundation Building cultivators were green. Among them, green souls were suitable for breaking through the apertures while white souls were much inferior."I'll give it a try." With a thought, the plesiosaur's soul shadow in his body instantly burned. The flames that rose from it were exuberant. After it completely burned, the flames rushed straight for the third magic aperture Xu Qing chose.Xu Qing's body suddenly shook and his third magic aperture trembled, as though a crack had appeared. However, in the end, it didn't break open. The plesiosaur's soul power also dissipated."It's indeed effective, but the process is too slow." Xu Qing pondered. He felt that perhaps it was because he wasn't familiar with it, so he controlled the magic ship to change to another area and continued to fish for plesiosaurs using the same method.The pseudotooth bird was only a catalyst. He emitted Qi Condensation fluctuations that lingered under the sea and used himself as bait.At the same time, he was also prepared to take off immediately if the situation didn't look good. After all, this kind of fishing… had a chance of luring some terrifying existences he couldn't resist.However, the probability wasn't high. After all, to those existences, the aura of Qi Condensation wasn't fragrant enough.Three days later, under Xu Qing's continued temptation, the second plesiosaur got close. He repeated the same thing and transformed it into soul power to continue bombarding his third aperture, causing more cracks to appear on it.Finally, after changing many locations and fishing for more than half a month, after he caught the seventeenth plesiosaur that was comparable to the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, half of his third magic aperture was blasted open."Too slow…" Xu Qing mumbled and frowned. He calculated that at this speed, he would have to spend at least three years at sea without sleep or rest before he could open 30 magic apertures.He knew that he was being too optimistic. This was because the activation of the magic apertures would be more difficult and required more soul power the further he progressed. As such, Xu Qing felt that there was a high chance that this time estimation would double. This didn't include returning to the main city or the accidents he might encounter. If he calculated them all, a conservative estimate would be more than ten years."I have to think of a way to kill more sea beasts at once!" A cold glint rose in Xu Qing's eyes. Suddenly, his expression changed and he lifted his head to look into the distance.At this moment, the waves on the distant sea suddenly surged. He could see a megalodon shark speeding inside. The fluctuations of a Foundation Building cultivator were very intense. Behind it, in the sky, a figure stood on a huge ancient bronze sword, chasing after it.This figure was a youth. He wore the crimson Daoist robe of the Seven Blood Eyes' First Peak. His long hair fluttered in the wind and his expression was extremely cold. His gaze was cold.At that moment, he coldly glanced at Xu Qing from afar and calmly spoke."Calling the wind and summoning the rain is too common. I'll hide it in a star bag."Xu Qing frowned.

Chapter 214 Opening Apertures On The Deserted Island
The Daoist robes of the Seven Blood Eyes were divided into seven colors according to the different mountain peaks.Among them, orange indicated the Second Peak, blue was the Sixth Peak, and purple was the Seventh Peak.As for the First Peak, it was red like blood.In the entire Seven Blood Eyes, the peaks that were truly famous in the Nanhuang Continent and the Forbidden Sea were actually the First Peak and the Seventh Peak.Among them, the First Peak was known for its killing and callousness. Every one of them was a battle cultivator and rarely went out to sea. Most of them were tempering themselves in the Phoenix Forbidden.Only those on the First Peak who were confident in their cultivation and combat strength would occasionally choose the Forbidden Sea that they were unfamiliar with to temper their combat techniques. Hence, regardless of whether it was in the sect or the Forbidden Sea, this was the first First Peak battle cultivator Xu Qing had seen.Moreover, he would not be mistaken because of the robe.This was because the Daoist robes of the various peaks had some obscure patterns that were related to their tokens and auras, causing the Daoist robe patterns to flicker when they met.This was designed to prevent people from disguising as a disciple in the outside world.Although they were from the same sect, Xu Qing's vigilance didn't decrease at all. He couldn't understand the meaning of the other party's baffling words and vaguely felt that he was being reminded not to snatch the megalodon.After all, the words hide in a bag coupled with the other party's actions of chasing after the megalodon faintly revealed something.The black iron stick shone with a cold light beside Xu Qing. The shadow under his feet looked normal, but it was already prepared to pounce over.It was the same for his magic ship. The plesiosaur in his body also swam in his magic aperture, and the spikes on its neck swayed rapidly.The moment Xu Qing stared at it, the megalodon that was fleeing toward him saw that there was someone in front of it with an extraordinary aura. It let out a roar and turned to devour the youth chasing after it.As it opened its mouth, a ball of blood mist spurted out, transforming into countless shadows of fish and prawns that headed straight for the First Peak's youth."Just a mere heavenly river water, I can finish it in one gulp," the youth calmly said. He then performed a series of hand seals. Immediately, the large bronze sword under him buzzed and transformed into rows of sword shadows.In the blink of an eye, more than 50 identical bronze swords formed in the surroundings. Waves of murderous aura spread from them. Following the youth's signal, the bronze swords in the surroundings, other than the one under his feet, charged toward the megalodon.At the next instant, a shocking explosion rang out.Large waves rose on the surface of the sea, and the megalodon let out a mournful roar. Its several thousand-foot-long body was penetrated by seven to eight large swords. As it started bleeding, it suddenly dove into the sea and sped into the depths.Its blood flowed and fused with the seawater. The Foundation Building aura contained in it caused many sea beasts to not dare to approach. However, if this continued for a long time, the blood would definitely attract even more ferocious sea beasts.Xu Qing took a look.At the same time, the First Peak youth looked at the sea and snorted coldly."Snow-white jade hare glides to the sky, the black toad swims in the water."As he spoke, the bronze sword beneath him buzzed and directly expanded to nearly a thousand feet. It brought him straight to the sea and broke through the surface of the sea, chasing after the fleeing megalodon.From the start to the end, Xu Qing didn't say a word, nor did he go to snatch the kill. He calmly listened to the other party's nonsensical words and watched as he chased into the sea.After the First Peak's youth disappeared, Xu Qing retracted his gaze and controlled the magic ship to leave this place.From the youth's abilities, Xu Qing could sense that the other party was stronger than him but not by much. The youth hadn't reached the level of the Mystic Brilliance Form and had at most opened about 20 magic apertures.Xu Qing felt that he could win if he went all out and risked his life. However, there was no need to take the risk for a Foundation Building sea beast.He left the area and sailed for a few days before arriving at another area.This was a deserted island, it was the midpoint between the Western Reef Archipelago and the Nanhuang Continent, and was not far away from the place where Xu Qing had encountered the vines.This island wasn't big and its edges were concave. It was a natural bay.There were many deserted islands on the Forbidden Sea. Some of them existed for a long time, while others were occasionally formed. The former was usually real islands, while the latter was mostly formed on top of some giant sea beasts.As for this deserted island, Xu Qing had checked below it. It was real and there was an introduction of it on the nautical chart. Because it was barren, no one usually came here.Xu Qing also investigated the island. After confirming that there was no danger, he sat on the deck of the ship in the bay and took out a small bottle from his pocket.It contained blue liquid.This liquid was the blood of the Ghost Desires.After the Ghost Desires' blood was refined with the yin and yang polarities, and mixed with some herbs, it could form an aura that attracted ferocious beasts in the Forbidden Sea.Back then, the merfolk youth had used something similar on Xu Qing.This was also the method Xu Qing had thought of to open his magic apertures as soon as possible. He wanted to attract a large number of sea beasts to kill and extract their souls. However, this aura was very difficult to control. There was a high chance that it would attract some extremely powerful beasts.Hence, he needed to regulate it. Xu Qing had an item which could do that; it was the ammonite.With the medicinal properties of the ammonite, it could control the aura to a certain level. This way, although there was still a certain risk, Xu Qing felt that he could give it a try."Once it's activated, it will disperse on its own…" Xu Qing sat on the deck and began to refine the blood of the Ghost Desires. The entire process lasted for an hour, and it was already dusk.He looked at the ammonite shell that had been refined in front of him. Its color had turned blue. Now, he only needed a drop of his blood to activate it. Xu Qing looked at the sky. After pondering for a moment, he didn't activate it right away. Instead, he closed his eyes and meditated.It was a night of silence.The instant the next morning arrived, Xu Qing opened his eyes and began to sprinkle poison in the surroundings.Because it was a bay, the poison powder wouldn't be washed away very quickly after merging with the seawater. Xu Qing's determination this time was very strong, so the poison he administered was even more intense. However, they all required some complementary items to activate.After scattering a large amount of poison powder in the bay, Xu Qing took a deep breath and took out an incense stick, placing it at the side.This incense was the poison primer he had refined. Once it was thrown into the sea, it could instantly turn the poison powder he had scattered into powerful poison."Everything is ready." Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. He bit his fingertip and dripped a drop of blood onto the blue ammonite in front of him. As the blood landed, the color of the ammonite instantly darkened and a faint smell rose.If one didn't smell it carefully, it would be very difficult to detect.As it continued to drift, Xu Qing warily looked at the entrance of the bay ahead. He held the poison primer incense and waited silently.Time passed.An hour later, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He saw a huge wave rising on the distant surface of the sea. A baleen whale that was about a thousand feet in size leaped up from there, emitting an ear-piercing cry. When it landed again, the sea churned, revealing countless crocodile-like fish under the sea.These were black-scaled crocodiles. They lived in the Forbidden Sea and had similar habits as black-scaled wolves. They often lived in groups of a hundred or more. Their cultivation levels had reached the eighth or ninth level of Qi Condensation.As for the baleen whale, it was at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm.Xu Qing's eyes lit up. As he continued to wait, the black-scaled crocodiles headed straight for the bay where he was at. The baleen whale was also rushing over.Not long later, the bay area rumbled. All the black-scaled crocodiles rushed in and slammed into Xu Qing.Xu Qing's magic ship's defense was fully activated. The baleen whale also smashed fiercely into it.There was a loud collision, although Xu Qing's magic ship shook intensely, it didn't shatter.Just like the jungle in the forbidden zone, most of the ferocious beasts in the sea were like body refinement cultivators. Very few of them used spells and they often maximized the advantage of their bodies."There are only over a hundred of them. It's not enough…" Xu Qing's breathing hastened slightly. He didn't care about the consumption of spirit stones as he used them to maintain the defense of the ship while looking at the sea. Very soon, he saw waves churning again.Many swordfish that were much larger than what he had seen before swam over. They were coming in a large group of several hundred.Although most of them were at the third or fifth level of Qi Condensation, 45 of them had reached the eighth and ninth level of Qi Condensation.Their eyes had turned red due to the lure of the aura. As they rushed into the bay, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He then threw the poison primer incense into the sea.  BEst novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  In an instant, the black sea water became even darker like thick ink. The hundreds of poisons contained in it erupted completely at this moment.The bodies of the black-scaled crocodiles trembled and lost their mobility. It was useless for the baleen whale to struggle. Its body was numbed by the poison and it was difficult for it to move.As for those swordfish, it was the same. The entire process only lasted for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn before the entire bay calmed down from the intense churning.Xu Qing's gaze was filled with anticipation. He lifted his right hand and grabbed fiercely. Immediately, the sea beasts were grabbed by the large hand formed by the seawater and moved closer to him.As these sea beasts that hadn't been completely poisoned were brought before him, the fire in Xu Qing's magic apertures spread out and enveloped them.Although his poison was intense, the main point wasn't to kill but to make them lose the ability to counterattack.As the black flames burned, wisps of souls were absorbed into Xu Qing's body. They transformed into soul shadows in his dantian and burned like firewood. He controlled them to rush toward his third magic aperture.At the next instant, Xu Qing's body trembled and his eyes gleamed. The third magic aperture in his body was open!As it opened, the spirit energy gushed in and formed a vortex. Traces of magic power rose and fused into his entire body, increasing the amount of Xu Qing's magic power.He didn't stop. The black flames outside his body continued to extract the souls. Just like that, time flowed by. When the sky completely darkened, the fourth magic aperture in Xu Qing's body was opened!At this point, this bay had become a land of death. On the surface, it looked fine, but there were countless beast corpses buried under the sea.As the four magic apertures in Xu Qing's body circulated, a large amount of magic power spread throughout his body and his aura was much stronger than before.The black flames in his four magic apertures illuminated his body and flames flickered on his body.Although the difference between him and the captain's Mystic Brilliance Form was still huge, compared to someone who had just advanced to Foundation Building, Xu Qing's magic power was already majestic because of his deep foundation."This speed is not bad!" After a long time, Xu Qing opened his eyes and surveyed his surroundings before continuing to refine the blood of the Ghost Desires.

Chapter 215 Killing Intent Surges
Time flowed like water.The beast corpses were like autumn leaves, falling one after another.In the blink of an eye, more than 20 days passed.Xu Qing was no longer in the bay he had started in. He had already been to five deserted islands.Now, on the sixth deserted island, he sat in the simple bay that he had created himself.In these twenty-odd days, other than changing locations, he was completely immersed in the impact on his magic apertures, allowing him to open his tenth magic aperture.In the black iron stick, the Diamond Sect's ancestor had already felt his heart pounding countless times in the past half a month or so. Later on, he felt a little dazed. He felt as though he had entered the world in the ancient books…The more magic apertures were opened, the more soul power it would require and the more difficult it would be to open other magic apertures. It took him eight years to open the tenth one.As for Xu Qing, it had only been more than 20 days…This speed caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor's heart to tremble violently. He knew that Foundation Building cultivators of the Seven Blood Eyes usually needed about two years to open ten magic apertures.They would only be able to reach Xu Qing's speed if there was a large-scale battle and they continuously fought and survived.The Seven Blood Eyes hadn't had a large-scale war for many years. Usually, there would be small frictions and the scale would be controlled to a certain extent. As for the sea beasts, although the Forbidden Sea was large and the intelligence of the sea beasts was low, it was very difficult to kill them in groups.Only some poisons, array formations, or other special methods could allow someone to advance rapidly like Xu Qing.However, there weren't many such people.Not only did this require external help, but it also required one's strength to be extraordinary. They also had to make sure they didn't attract powerful sea beasts. There were many restrictions.Xu Qing was also aware that he couldn't continue this for a long time.Firstly, Ghost Desires were rare. Out of the two he had obtained, he had refined one before, and there was not much of its blood left. At the same time, he did not have many ammonites left.Also, during these few days, Xu Qing was feeling a sense of trepidation. There were quite a lot of beast corpses under every bay he stayed in. Even though Xu Qing frequently changed places, this might still attract the attention of some terrifying existences in the sea.Xu Qing already had the intention to leave. At that moment, after he extracted the soul of the plesiosaur that had arrived, he stood up and prepared to leave while breaking through the eleventh magic aperture in his body.Although many more cracks appeared in the eleventh magic aperture, it still didn't break open. Xu Qing's eyes suddenly narrowed. He looked at the distant sea and his eyes slowly revealed a sharp glint."This aura…"Just as he was watching, the surface of the sea suddenly rose. A sea beast with a body of about a thousand feet and covered in armor that exuded a metallic feeling rushed out of the sea.Its body actually stopped in mid-air as it looked at Xu Qing in the bay."Foundation Building torpedo scad!" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. This wasn't the first Foundation Building sea beast he had encountered in the past twenty or so days. He had encountered one seven days ago. It was a helicoprion.The terrifying appearance, astonishing aura, and the feeling of having a stove burning in its body had made Xu Qing realize that the other party had the Mystic Brilliance Form. He had immediately gone ashore and fully activated his magic ship.However, the helicoprion didn't seem to have much interest in him. It left after taking a look.Xu Qing kept his gaze on the torpedo scad and quickly weighed the other party's strength. This torpedo scad clearly had intelligence and didn't approach directly. Instead, it looked from the distance and landed on the surface of the sea, swimming rapidly in the surroundings as though it was also weighing Xu Qing's strength.The armor on its body continued to sway, emitting clanking sounds. This was a sound unique to torpedo scad. After swimming for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, its speed suddenly erupted as it rushed toward the bay Xu Qing was in.As it rushed over, it leaped up again and let out a roar at Xu Qing. This roar formed a sound wave that swept up the surface of the sea, forming a huge wave that rumbled toward Xu Qing.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes and the magic ship beneath him suddenly buzzed. While the divinity was gathering, Xu Qing grabbed at the air. Immediately, his plesiosaur appeared in the air and smashed toward the torpedo scad. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  A loud collision rang out as the torpedo scad was sent back. It seemed to have sensed that Xu Qing wasn't someone to be trifled with and decisively dove into the sea, wanting to retreat."It doesn't have Mystic Brilliance Form!" Xu Qing's eyes lit up. This kind of Foundation Building sea beast that didn't have Mystic Brilliance Form was something he yearned to encounter. How could he let the other party escape now?He decisively rushed out. His speed was so fast that he transformed into a stream of light. With a wave of his hand, the heavenly saber shone above his head and slashed fiercely at the surface of the sea below.The sea rumbled and a 1000-foot-long gap directly opened, revealing the torpedo scad below. However, the iron armor on its body was too powerful. It was unscathed even after being struck by the heavenly saber. Its ferocity seemed to have been agitated as it turned around and rushed toward Xu Qing.The black iron stick quickly appeared. It emitted a cold light with a hint of blue. That was poison.This was something the Diamond Sect's ancestor had taken the initiative to implore Xu Qing to apply.It quickly approached the torpedo scad. Its target seemed to be the iron armor on its body, but in reality, the moment it got close, it strangely changed its direction and ruthlessly stabbed the torpedo scad's eye.The torpedo scad roared and its body shook slightly. Immediately, countless scale shadows appeared around it. Each of them contained Foundation Building magic power that could kill Qi Condensation cultivators.There were a hundred of them and they swept in all directions. However, Xu Qing was already approaching it.As the black flames in his body spread out, flames rose outside his body and gathered in his right hand, turning into a dagger.This was a spell that matched with the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art after ten magic apertures were opened. It was called the Fiendish Edge.Its appearance could be changed according to the cultivator's needs. At that moment, Xu Qing threw the dagger. It easily pierced into the torpedo scad's body, breaking its armor and transforming into flames that spread throughout its body.This wasn't the end. The shadow under Xu Qing's feet wasn't to be outdone and rapidly moved toward the torpedo scad, causing terror to appear in its eyes. Its entire body shook and the iron armor around its body instantly dispersed. After the burning flames on its body dissipated, the iron armor transformed into a metal storm that swept toward Xu Qing.It then swung its tail and broke through the surface of the sea, creating a water wall as it rose into the air. Xu Qing was blocked by the metal storm, the torpedo scad turned its head and stared fixedly at Xu Qing. It suddenly opened its mouth and spat out a black bead that was ten feet long.The bead was filled with rotting corpses of humans and beasts. All of them suddenly opened their eyes and let out mournful cries, as though they wanted to crawl out of the bead. Their limbs even protruded from the bead.This scene caused the bead to look like it was covered in soft thorns as it moved toward Xu Qing.A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. The flames on his body rose even more. The Ba shadow behind him transformed and charged forward with a roar. The Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur rushed out from the bottom of the sea and devoured the black bead.As a shocking sound echoed, the bead was devoured by the plesiosaur. It seemed like it was about to explode in its body but it was firmly suppressed by the plesiosaur. However, the plesiosaur was formed from a spell after all and didn't seem to be able to last long.At this moment, Xu Qing also broke through the metal storm and activated all of his defenses. When he got close to the torpedo scad that had landed on the surface of the sea, the flames in his hand transformed into a new dagger that ruthlessly stabbed into the other party's eye.The torpedo scad roared and struggled to enter the deep sea. However, Xu Qing's shadow split into two. One connected to the island in the bay and the other wrapped around the torpedo scad.The torpedo scad felt as though it was bound. As it struggled, Xu Qing's right hand grabbed the dagger that had pierced into the other party's eyes. At the same time, he lifted his left hand and flames erupted from the ten magic apertures in his body. They gathered in his left hand and pressed down on the torpedo scad's body, spreading out and starting to burn it.As the flames burned it, strands of soul power rapidly fused into Xu Qing's body. However, at this moment, a sense of danger erupted in Xu Qing's mind.He abruptly lifted his head and immediately saw dozens of bronze swords whistling toward the torpedo scad with astonishing lethality.The range was very large and they completely ignored the fact that Xu Qing was still here. When they got close, vortexes appeared in the surrounding seawater, causing Xu Qing to have no choice but to release his hand and perform a series of hand seals. The black flames in his body transformed into a shield above him and blocked the swords.Amidst the rumbling sounds of impact, dozens of large bronze swords landed and penetrated the heavily injured torpedo scad, directly cutting it into pieces. Xu Qing also retreated from the impact.After he retreated out of the range of the bronze swords, Xu Qing stopped. His expression was gloomy as he looked at the dismembered fish corpse floating on the sea. He then looked at the youth who was approaching on a bronze sword.The red Daoist robe on the other party made him very conspicuous."Worthwhile to stay up late till dawn, and casually call out a treasure."The youth from the First Peak stood on the large sword with his hands behind his back. Strands of qi and blood rose from the corpse parts of the torpedo scad and were absorbed by him. He then coldly looked at Xu Qing and turned to leave after leaving behind this baffling sentence.Xu Qing didn't say anything. He glanced at his Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur. The bead in its body no longer struggled because of the death of the torpedo scad. It was already suppressed by his life-bound plesiosaur and was being refined.As for the soul power in his body, although he didn't have time to extract all of it from the torpedo scad's body earlier, he still extracted 40% of it. At this moment, it was charging toward the eleventh magic aperture.At the next instant, the eleventh magic aperture was opened.The magic power in Xu Qing's body suddenly rose. He looked at the departing First Peak's youth. He could tell that the other party hadn't formed his life fire either. Hence, killing intent rose in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, the magic ship that was docked in the bay flashed with golden light and a terrifying divine fluctuation erupted.A golden beam of light shot out with incomparable holiness, directly blasting toward the departing First Peak youth.For the first time, the expression of the First Peak's youth changed. He quickly performed a series of hand seals in mid-air and the bronze sword under him stood in front of him to block. At the next instant, it came into contact with the divinity attack and directly shattered into pieces. At the same time, blood flowed from the corner of the First Peak's youth's mouth.His body was sent back a thousand feet from the force. Killing intent flashed in his eyes as he looked at Xu Qing."How easily youth takes its leave while I remain. High up on a building I face the wee hours with a shattered life!"Xu Qing didn't understand but his killing intent had already risen. His speed erupted as he headed straight for the other party. After he got close, the dagger appeared in his right hand and he slashed ruthlessly at the neck of the youth in front of him!

Chapter 216 Death In The Air
Xu Qing had his own principles.Previously, when the other party chased after a Foundation Building megalodon that was moving toward him, it wasn't that he wasn't tempted, but he restrained himself from attacking because he felt that it wasn't his.Just like when Captain Lei gave him the bun back then, he was deeply grateful and ate it bit by bit. However, he wouldn't think that it was wrong even if Captain Lei didn't give it to him.Therefore, when he treated Captain Lei to the snake later on, he ate it ravenously.He could eat his things however he wanted.What happened today was the same. He was the one who attracted this Foundation Building torpedo scad. Moreover, he had already beaten it to near death and was extracting its soul.However, the other party brazenly attacked and killed it. This behavior violated Xu Qing's red line.The last person to do this was the merfolk youth.Towards such a person, if they were extremely powerful, Xu Qing would endure it and kill them in the future. However, it was obvious that the other party wasn't that strong, so Xu Qing wouldn't endure it.He moved extremely fast. The dagger in his hand emitted a terrifying black fire. The instant he slashed at the other party's neck, a loud sound rang out.Although the large sword of the First Peak's youth collapsed, with a wave of his hand, an illusory sword appeared in front of him and blocked Xu Qing's dagger.As the sound spread out, the Ba shadow behind Xu Qing roared and punched out fiercely with its left hand.This punch contained all the power of his Mountains and Seas Art and his magic body, causing a vortex to appear in the void in front of him. It seemed to be able to tear through everything as it headed toward the First Peak's youth.The First Peak's youth's expression changed and he quickly retreated. He quickly performed a series of hand seals. However, at this moment, the shadow had silently reached him and bound his hands, interrupting his hand seals.The impact of this pause was extremely great.In the blink of an eye, the Ba shadow's left fist closed in and directly smashed into the illusory sword in front of the youth's chest.The fist broke through the large sword and landed on the youth's chest.The First Peak spat out blood as he was sent back like a broken kite. However, before he could neutralize the terrifying force in his body, the sea below rumbled and the plesiosaur broke out of the surface of the sea to devour him.There was also a huge shadow of the heavenly saber that appeared above Xu Qing. With a shocking momentum, it slashed at the First Peak's youth.At this critical moment, the eyes of the First Peak's youth turned red and he let out a roar. It was as though a stove had been ignited in his body like the Mystic Brilliance Form.As the boundless light spread out, the plesiosaur below shattered, turning into countless pieces that fell into the sea. Although it reformed, it was clearly heavily injured. The moment the heavenly saber landed, a loud sound rang out.Although it slashed down completely, it didn't cut the First Peak's youth into two. Under the eruption of the stove in his body, the First Peak's youth only spat out blood and borrowed the momentum to retreat by 1000 feet.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He could tell that although the stove in the other party's body was similar to the Mystic Brilliance Form, it was not the real one. It should be formed by some kind of secret art that could display a portion of the power of the Mystic Brilliance Form.However, it was impossible to get out unscathed after using the power of the Mystic Brilliance Form before the life fire was formed.As the youth from the First Peak retreated, he spat out a lot of blood. The stove in his body disappeared and his face turned pale. However, he didn't avoid Xu Qing's gaze at all. Instead, his battle intent grew increasingly intense.He didn't know Xu Qing, nor did he think he needed to know him. As the most recent disciple of the First Peak's Peak Lord, as the ninth highness of the First Peak, it had been a long time since he had encountered someone from the same sect who could beat him to such an extent.The killing intent in his eyes was intense. As he coldly looked at Xu Qing, he regulated the surging qi and blood in his body and wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. He then waved his right hand fiercely. Immediately, large bronze swords appeared behind him one after another.More than 30 of them formed instantly. They arranged themselves into a rhombus pattern that looked like an array formation. He pointed at Xu Qing; immediately, these large swords charged straight toward Xu Qing.He also rushed toward Xu Qing along with the swords. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Xu Qing's expression was calm and he charged straight forward without the slightest hesitation. With a wave of his hand, black flames rose from the 11 magic apertures in his body and erupted outside his body, causing his entire person to turn into a burning person. There were also daggers that transformed from the flames.The two of them instantly collided in mid-air. A rumbling sound rang out, shaking the heavens and the earth.All of Xu Qing's daggers collapsed and the flames on his body dimmed. However, the large swords of the First Peak's youth also shattered into pieces.The fight between the two became even more intense.Xu Qing didn't care about his injuries at all. His body refinement technique combined with his magic body gave him a powerful body.However, the youth from the First Peak wasn't ordinary either. Many sword shadows formed in the surroundings and slashed at Xu Qing. They fought until the sky darkened. Wherever they passed, waves would surge and ebb. Xu Qing waved his right hand, and the huge waves instantly transformed into a large hand that grabbed at the First Peak's youth. As for the youth, he performed a series of hand seals and pressed between his brows. The mark of the sun appeared on his forehead and flashed toward the large hand. The large hand formed by seawater directly collapsed.Xu Qing frowned but he did not stop attacking. When the two of them got close enough, he directly punched the youth's head.Blood flowed out of the corners of Xu Qing's mouth. As for the youth, he wailed miserably and his forehead was caved in like it was about to shatter. He quickly retreated.Xu Qing was about to pursue but his mind trembled and he retreated immediately.The instant he retreated, numerous sharp blade fragments that had shattered earlier suddenly rose from the bottom of the sea, forming a sharp blade storm that swept past the place Xu Qing was at earlier.If he had really chased after the youth, he would definitely have been hit by the blade storm.As for the wailing youth, he no longer wailed but stopped dozens of feet away. His breathing was hurried as he looked at Xu Qing with shock.He knew he was very strong. His master had also praised him as the strongest new Foundation Building cultivator in the history of the First Peak before the Mystic Brilliance Form.He thought so too.Today, his thoughts were shaken. However, he was still unconvinced, so he spoke gloomily."When the heavens stroll, will the sun and moon dare to shine?!"What responded to him was the second divinity attack from Xu Qing's magic ship.Wherever the divine light passed, the sea would rumble and the sky seemed to distort. The expression of the First Peak's youth changed drastically. He immediately waved his hand and a jade talisman appeared in front of him.It instantly exploded and a large number of soul shadows surged out.These soul shadows were all beasts he had killed. He had used a special method to seal them as a spell for himself. Most of them were beasts from the forbidden zone's jungle. At this moment, they formed a black beast head that resisted the divinity.The surroundings shook.The First Peak's youth bit the tip of his tongue and spat out some blood in his hand. He quickly pressed it on his forehead.His body trembled and his qi and blood instantly overflowed. His skin completely turned red and he seemed to have turned into a bloody person with an even sharper intent.Vaguely, a large blood-colored sword formed outside his body. It enveloped and became one with him. He tore through the air toward Xu Qing.A sense of danger surfaced in Xu Qing's mind. He waved his hand without hesitating; immediately, the 5,000-foot-long spirit seas in each of the 11 magic apertures in his body rose in unison.55,000 feet of spirit sea suddenly erupted around him.This eruption influenced the sea, causing the surrounding 55,000 feet of the Forbidden Sea to rise and fuse with his spirit sea. The aura of the Forbidden Sea inside had turned so dense that it had transformed into a kind of suppression.The blood sword collided with it.Xu Qing's 55,000-foot-long spirit sea fluctuated intensely and was rapidly neutralized. As for the blood sword, it also showed signs of collapsing.Ten breaths later, the blood sword collapsed. As it shattered into pieces, the youth's body rolled back. However, the instant he was sent back, Xu Qing's 5000-foot-long spirit sea squirmed and transformed into a huge fist that punched out fiercely.The sea roared and the First Peak's youth spat out large mouthfuls of blood. He decisively took out a pearl and crushed it.Immediately, a layer of fog surrounded him and blocked Xu Qing's terrifying attack. At the same time, he quickly fled into the distance.He didn't want to fight anymore.On one hand, he felt that he couldn't do anything to the other party. On the other hand, he was a little frightened by the dense spirit sea of this Seventh Peak's disciple.He couldn't see through the other party's cultivation but he felt that he shouldn't be far from forming his life fire.However, the instant he fled, a black shadow that seemed to have been hiding in the sea beneath him for a long time suddenly appeared and wrapped around his legs.At the same time, a black iron stick, which had been hidden until now, headed straight for the youth's neck!All of this happened too suddenly and the youth almost lost his balance. The black iron stick landed on his neck.However, it wasn't able to break the youth's neck. As for the shadow's entanglement, the youth's body seemed to have been smeared with oil and he quickly broke free.However, the price of resolving this life-and-death situation was the shattering of a jade pendant that the youth was wearing.This was a life-saving item his master had given him. To a certain extent, it could be used as a substitute for death once. After it shattered, the youth's eyes revealed fear for the first time. He instantly sped up and left.However, behind him, Xu Qing waved his hand and the magic ship flew over from the bay. Xu Qing stepped on it. As the shadow and the black iron stick returned, Xu Qing chased after the fleeing youth.He didn't hesitate at all the entire time.The other party was very strong. It could even be said that other than the captain in his Mystic Brilliance Form, he was the strongest Foundation Building cultivator Xu Qing had encountered.Back then, the Diamond Sect's ancestor would probably be killed in three breaths of time if he encountered this person.However, daring to snatch his things meant this person was on his must-kill list!

Chapter 217 Tragic
Although the youth from the First Peak was fast, this was the sea. No matter how fast he was, he had to rely on himself, especially since the bronze sword had been destroyed by Xu Qing.As for Xu Qing, he was moving on his magic ship. Not only did he not consume his energy, but he could also recover during the pursuit. In this way, the outcome of this chase could naturally be imagined.In reality, this was the strength of the Seventh Peak's boat cultivators.As a boat cultivator, after reaching the Foundation Building realm, not only were they powerful on the shore, but they could also last a long time in sea battles. In just two hours, Xu Qing's magic ship caught up with the anxious youth.When it came to killing, Xu Qing wouldn't be stingy with the divinity of the magic ship. The instant he got close, the divinity attack erupted explosively.The First Peak's youth let out a blood-curdling scream. He quickly performed a series of hand seals and took out a large number of talismans to block the attack. Only then did he avoid death with some injuries. He didn't even turn his head as he continued to flee.Xu Qing let out a cold snort and continued to pursue.Very soon, night fell.When the sun set, and the sky and sea seemed to turn into one color, Xu Qing's magic ship caught up again. This time, he didn't use divinity but leaped up fiercely the moment he caught up.With a wave of his hand, the sea roared and the plesiosaur suddenly rushed out to stop the First Peak's youth. At the same time, Xu Qing also strode toward the other party. He also threw out the black iron stick which circled the surroundings, searching for an opportunity.At this moment, the excitement of the Diamond Sect's ancestor had already reached the peak of his life."Master, Master, we must get rid of this guy!""According to my countless experiences reading ancient books, this kid isn't a simple person. I can tell from his clothes that he's from the First Peak of your Seven Blood Eyes. Moreover, he's already so strong even though he's at the Foundation Building realm and hasn't formed his life fire. Generally speaking, such a person is the main character in the books. His identity shouldn't be simple either, he might even be a highness.""Master Have you noticed? This fellow never speaks properly. In the books, people with such characteristics are very difficult to kill!""However, compared to Master, he's a fake dragon, only Master is a true dragon. In the ancient books I read, although such a person is filled with luck, Master will be able to obtain his luck after he's killed. We can't let him off!""Also, this person is too pretentious. His words are rubbish. If we beat him until he speaks human language, it will be so satisfying!"As the Diamond Sect's ancestor spoke excitedly, he controlled the black iron stick to rapidly approach. At the same time, he was cheering in his mind.'You're dead meat. I'm the only one who can survive this Demon Xu's pursuit. There won't be a second one!'The black iron stick controlled by the Diamond Sect's ancestor was extremely fast. The instant it got close, Xu Qing also stepped over. He raised his right hand and pressed down fiercely. Immediately, the heavenly saber appeared and ruthlessly descended.The First Peak youth wailed inwardly and immediately took out more than ten talismans and threw them out in unison. He decisively made them self-destruct. They formed powerful energy waves that resisted the plesiosaur below and the heavenly saber above, making space for him to dodge.However, the Diamond Sect's ancestor found an opportunity and instantly pierced through his arm.The First Peak's youth's breathing was hurried and viciousness appeared in his eyes as he let out a low roar."Burn!"As soon as he finished speaking, the blood on the black iron stick burned.The Diamond Sect's ancestor exclaimed and quickly suppressed it. After that, he seemed to feel that he had lost face and let out a low shout. He immediately formed into a large seal and sent it smashing at the other party.The First Peak's youth was about to attack but Xu Qing had already arrived. When he got close, the black flames on his body flew out, enveloping the youth as though they wanted to extract his soul.This ruthless and savage action completely intimidated the First Peak's youth. He spoke anxiously, wanting to tell the other party that there was no need for this since they were from the same sect."Home in the Southern Immortal Kingdom, we are fellow villagers!"Xu Qing didn't understand and his ears automatically blocked the other party's words. The black fire enveloped the youth with all its might.At this critical moment, the First Peak's youth took out a statue. This statue was black and had the shape of a human. After he threw it out, it instantly shone with light and transformed.It transformed into a middle-aged cultivator in a black Daoist robe. He expressionlessly waved his sleeve at Xu Qing. Immediately, a violent wind appeared, sweeping in all directions and blocking Xu Qing's black flames.The black flames shook and rolled back. Xu Qing's body also trembled and blood flowed out of his mouth. He quickly retreated far away. When he looked forward again, the youth from the First Peak had already taken the opportunity to escape."Master, this kid has too many tricks up his sleeve. Let's use poison!" The black iron stick quickly returned and the voice of the Diamond Sect's ancestor rang out, revealing a strong sense of common hatred."I used it long ago," Xu Qing said coldly as he looked at the First Peak's youth in the distance.At this moment, the First Peak's youth suddenly spat out a large mouthful of black blood. The horror on his face was clearly much greater than before. He sensed that his qi and blood were unstable and his internal organs were aching as though they were being corroded.This sign of poisoning caused him to hurriedly take out the antidote pills. However, not only were they useless, but the poisoning became even more intense.This poison was specially refined by Xu Qing to counter antidotes. It was very difficult for his poison to be neutralized by antidotes.The First Peak's youth had no choice but to use a secret art to forcefully suppress the poison while shouting inwardly.He felt that there was no need for this matter to be like this. He had already said that they were both from the same sect. Why was there a need to continue the battle? Wasn't it just snatching a Foundation Building sea beast? There was no need to chase after him to the death."The chaotic world is the time, who am I to push others too far!"Xu Qing didn't care. He controlled the magic ship and rammed the youth fiercely.The youth let out a mournful cry. He felt that he couldn't communicate with this kid from the Seventh Peak. He had already introduced himself and revealed his identity, but the other party still wanted to fight.If this continued, he might really die here. This made him anxious. He bit the tip of his tongue again and spat out a mouthful of blood, transforming into a blood sword to distance himself.Just like that, time passed.Xu Qing's cruelty and persistence were completely reflected in this pursuit. He chased after this First Peak youth for two days and three nights in a row!During this time, they fought many times. There would be explosive sounds every time they fought and the poison on the youth's body would deepen. However, this person was quite capable. It was unknown what method he used but he actually used the Blood Release Technique to neutralize a portion of the poison.At the same time, he also used his secret art many times. Every time, he would transform into a blood sword and escape, causing Xu Qing to only be able to injure him despite attacking several times. It was difficult to kill the youth in one strike.However, Xu Qing was very patient and continued to pursue. At the same time, the Diamond Sect's ancestor also gasped inwardly. He looked at the youth in front of him and thought of himself.'Kid, even though you can be considered the main character in the books, you can't do anything when you encounter Demon Xu. Unless you learn from me, but the spots are limited. There is only the magic ship left for you.' As the Diamond Sect's ancestor took a deep breath, he couldn't help but feel very proud.At that moment, this First Peak youth's hair was disheveled and his robes were tattered. He was in an extremely weak state, and his face was very pale due to the excessive loss of blood.He had bitten his tongue countless times. He felt that if he continued to bite, his tongue would probably be gone. His coldness had long disappeared.He had never met such a persistent person who would chase others for two days and three nights without sleep or rest. That momentum seemed to indicate that the other party would not give up unless he was killed."Autumn turned into winter with a numb heart, what is the destination of the falling leaves and blood!"The youth let out a mournful cry. He fiercely threw a jade slip behind him. The jade slip instantly exploded and a large number of souls appeared.These souls didn't emit any offensive postures, as though he was giving them to Xu Qing. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  These were all things he had collected. On one hand, they were needed for cultivation. On the other hand, he planned to return to the sect and sell them to the Foundation Building cultivators of the Seventh Peak. He knew that although these souls weren't as good as fresh souls when they were extracted from live beings, they were barely enough."Moon near the water, who doesn't know you are Xuanyuan!"In order to survive, he said this aggrievedly. After he finished speaking, he bit the tip of his tongue again and transformed into a blood sword to distance himself. Although Xu Qing couldn't understand the other party's nonsensical words, after seeing these souls, the black fire in his body spread out and breathed in.Immediately, these souls were absorbed into Xu Qing's body without any resistance. They turned into firewood and burned, attacking the twelfth magic aperture and blasting it open by half.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he chased even faster.This scene caused the grief and indignation on the face of the First Peak's youth to become even more intense. He felt that the other party was too impolite. He had already begged for mercy and given him compensation. He had already said that they were a family and even flattered the other party. Why did he have to go so far!!Wasn't it just a beast? There was no need for it to be like this. Hence, he quickly spoke."We see the sun, moon, and stars every day; old friends come and go; we are immortals!!"Xu Qing didn't say anything and continued to chase. Just like that, another day and night passed. The First Peak's youth had already thrown out all the souls he had accumulated.Xu Qing also opened two of the magic apertures in his body, directly reaching 13 opened apertures!However, he continued to chase and didn't give up at all. He also forcefully rushed over many times to kill the youth but the other party always escaped.As for the First Peak's youth, there was almost nothing left of his robe. In particular, the circles under his eyes were completely black, accentuating his even paler countenance.He even felt that he had seen stars several times. The feeling of dizziness and fatigue, as well as the weakness of his body and the corrosion of the poison, made him feel extreme despair.He was glad that he had made many preparations for this trip to the sea, allowing him to maintain his combat strength. He had successfully escaped several times from the Seventh Peak's pursuer.However, these surrounding areas were too far away. After so many days, he still didn't manage to escape back to the sect. It would take at least five more days.At the thought of this, the First Peak's youth felt even more despair. He also transmitted his message but the sea was too vast and his voice transmission couldn't reach that far.Seeing that the kid behind him was about to speed up again, the First Peak's youth wailed inwardly. Suddenly, a rumbling sound appeared in the sky in front of him.Figures whistled past in the distant sky. Thunder rumbled and a vortex formed in the sea.There were dozens of figures fighting each other. It could be seen that they were divided into two groups and their cultivation levels were hard to describe. Just the aftershocks from passing by made the sea seem like it was about to be suppressed and violent winds kept blowing in all directions.The sky also dimmed.As for the auras they emitted, even though they were very far away, it still caused the mind of the First Peak's youth to tremble violently and he even spat out a mouthful of blood.Xu Qing, who was at the back, also saw this scene. His mind also rumbled and he spat out blood.He looked at the figures flying in the sky. Any one of them was like a god, surpassing the Third Elder.Just a glance at them made Xu Qing feel as though his body was about to collapse. This caused his breathing to become heavy. One of the figures and the great wing under his feet allowed Xu Qing to recognize the other party's identity.At the same time, the eyes of the First Peak's youth lit up. He saw that one of those figures was his master, so he shouted crazily."The broken sun shines another day, a new line in the vast sea!!!"

Chapter 218 One Talisman, Two Lives
Perhaps it was because the First Peak's youth was too agitated, magic power gushed into his throat, causing his voice to break.His voice came out as sharp and miserable.Dozens of cultivators from both sides who were fighting in the distance heard the shout of the youth.Xu Qing's expression also changed as he abruptly retreated.What made him retreat wasn't just the inexplicable words of the First Peak's youth, but …the dozens of gazes that the voice had attracted.In Xu Qing's eyes, any one of these cultivators in the distant sky was like a god. Even though the aura they emitted was so far away, it still caused his body to tumble and he spat out blood.Now, they all looked over…Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all. The magic ship's protective barriers were all activated. He also took out many protective talismans. In fact, he even covered the ship with the plesiosaur.At the next instant, waves of unimaginable and indescribable pressure descended. Xu Qing's mind was shaken. The plesiosaur collapsed and so did his talismans.Fortunately, his magic ship wasn't ordinary and had divinity. Although the protective barriers had collapsed, the ship was intact.As Xu Qing's body trembled, he spat out a lot of blood. However, as the magic ship's defense reformed and he continued to accelerate his retreat, the pressure from the gazes were neutralized.As for the First Peak's youth, he also spat out blood. Three of the life-saving items protecting his body shattered in a row and he spat out seven to eight mouthfuls of blood. In fact, the blood-colored sword he transformed into also shattered into pieces. He even took out an extraordinary shield to resist but it still shattered.All of these barely allowed him to resist the pressure of the gazes.Xu Qing still felt lingering fear. As he rapidly retreated, he looked at the sky.The attacks of those god-like beings had changed the color of the sky and storms rose all around them.Among these figures, Xu Qing saw the peak lord of the Seventh Peak and six other people beside him. Although their clothes were of different colors, their auras were equally astonishing.Regarding the identities of these people, Xu Qing didn't need to guess anything.They should be the peak lords of the various mountain peaks of the Seven Blood Eyes.The ones who could fight against them and not be at a disadvantage were none other than the Sea Corpse Race.Xu Qing had seen the Sea Corpse Race on Merfolk Island. With his sharp gaze, he saw that the Sea Corpse Race members in the sky were all in human form. All of them wore black armor and their eyes revealed black flames. As the corpse poison on their bodies permeated the air, their pressure soared to the sky.Other than that, there were also some cultivators beside both sides. Although these cultivators' cultivation levels were much weaker than the main battle forces, they were still powerful. Among them… Xu Qing saw Third Elder and also saw similar-leveled cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race.Seeing this was already Xu Qing's limit, his eyes stung and he couldn't continue staring. He knew that he couldn't look anymore. Otherwise, he would definitely go blind and his body also wouldn't be able to withstand it.At the same time, a low roar rang out from the sky. An old man in a crimson Daoist robe on the Seven Blood Eyes' side suddenly waved his hand and golden swords formed around him. After forcing back the Sea Corpse Race cultivator who was fighting with him, he headed straight for Xu Qing and the First Peak's youth. This old man's face was as red as his robe and there seemed to be a burning person in his body. Even looking at him could shake the soul. Dense heat was continuously released from his body.Seeing him, the First Peak's youth's eyes revealed excitement as he roared loudly."A new line in the vast sea, the broken sun shines another day!!!""You rascal who doesn't know how to speak human language, hurry up and scram. You're courting death by staying here!" The old man from the First Peak who was rushing over shouted in a low voice. He turned his head and swept his sword horizontally, fighting against the Sea Corpse Race member who had stopped him from leaving the battlefield.In the blink of an eye, the two sides moved their battle further and further away.When Xu Qing heard this, he continued to make his ship retreat even more.As for the First Peak's youth not far away, he was also anxious. He knew very well that once his master left, he would be dead meat. Hence, he shouted with a red face and bloodshot eyes."Master, save me. This kid from the Seventh Peak has been chasing me for ten days and ten nights. He won't stop until he kills me. Master, don't leave. Save me!!"Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all. The magic ship beneath him hummed and dove into the deep sea.The old man from the First Peak was stunned. He was aware that this last disciple of his had become possessed ever since he found out that Ancient King Mystic Nether liked to hide profundities in poems. He rarely spoke human language and his every sentence was filled with nonsense.The last time he heard the kid speak human language was three years ago.His gaze instantly landed in the direction Xu Qing had fled in.Although he was separated by the seawater, Xu Qing's mind still shook under the other party's gaze. His body couldn't help but tremble and his entire body seemed to have lost all mobility at this moment. It was as though he was imprisoned and his life was on the line."You…" The First Peak's Peak Lord was about to speak."It's just a fight between children." At this moment, a calm voice rang out from the sky.The person who spoke was the Seventh Peak's Peak Lord, who was standing on a great wing and fighting three Sea Corpse Race members alone with ease.The expression of the First Peak's youth changed.However, the First Peak's Peak Lord was as calm as ever. It was unknown if the words he was about to say earlier had changed as he continued to speak. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  "The two of you are fooling around. What time is it now and you're still fighting among yourselves!" As he spoke, he waved his hand and threw out a golden talisman. This talisman looked like a runic treasure but it gave people the feeling that it was a hundred times stronger. It headed straight for the sea area where Xu Qing had dived into.After it got close, the talisman split into two. One of them instantly burrowed into the sea and chased after Xu Qing, breaking through the defense of his magic ship and sticking to his body. The other one ignored the horror of the First Peak's youth and slapped his face.The runes landed on both of them at the same time. Xu Qing and the First Peak's youth's bodies trembled. The runes dissipated, forming golden patterns that imprinted themselves on their skin.Upon closer inspection, these patterns seemed to have the same source."This is a life-linking talisman. It's fine if you're injured, but if one of you dies, the other's soul will be destroyed. If you're willing to kill, then so be it. If you're not, then scram back to the sect immediately. When you return, the life-linking will dissipate on its own!"The old man from the First Peak let out a low shout, stirring up a monstrous wave that swept Xu Qing and the First Peak's youth into the distance. After that, he rushed into the group of Sea Corpse cultivators. With a sweep of his sword, he directly severed half of a Sea Corpse cultivator's leg.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator was still moving, but the sword qi erupted and its lower body instantly collapsed.He was immediately stopped by a Sea Corpse Race cultivator of the same realm. The group of people from both sides moved further and further away as they battled.As the waves rose and fell, Xu Qing surfaced again with an ugly expression. He looked at the mark on his arm.This mark wasn't only formed on his arm but also on his entire body.The youth from the First Peak not far away was the same. However, what was different from Xu Qing was that he looked relieved. He even took out the broken large sword and approached Xu Qing's magic ship.Xu Qing looked at him coldly and spoke."What's your name?""I lived a befuddled life, my face is covered as I walk to the end of the world." The First Peak's youth glanced at Xu Qing and calmly spoke.Xu Qing couldn't hold back his killing intent. He waved his right hand fiercely. Immediately, a dagger formed by black flames materialized and headed straight for the youth.The youth's heart skipped a beat but he trusted his master. Hence, he endured it and didn't dodge, allowing the dagger to reach his neck. Just as it was about to cut the youth, Xu Qing felt an intense sense of danger.Xu Qing fell silent. He was certain that this life-linking talisman was truly powerful.With this life-linking talisman, he indeed couldn't kill the other party. As for crippling the latter's body or cultivation, it was meaningless.Once he went overboard, with this person's ruthlessness, it wasn't impossible for him to commit suicide.Moreover, this person was quite powerful. He would have to put some effort to cripple the other part. After Xu Qing weighed the pros and cons, he temporarily suppressed his killing intent and coldly glanced at the First Peak's youth. He then kept his dagger and returned to the magic ship.As Xu Qing left, the mind of the First Peak's youth recovered a little from the shock earlier. He had been really terrified as he also felt danger to his life.As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick, he took a deep breath and looked at the distant Seven Blood Eyes' Peak Lord. His mind was filled with sighs.'Why didn't I think of this!! This f*cking works too!!!'As for Xu Qing, after he returned to the ship, he sat down and controlled a part of the shadow to cover his body, causing it to emit anomalous substances in an attempt to corrode his body.This method was the method Xu Qing thought of to erase the life-linking talisman.Under the corrosion of the shadow, the life talisman dimmed a little. However, the process was slow.Xu Qing no longer bothered with the First Peak's youth. While slowly grinding down the talisman, he took out a bamboo slip and grabbed the black iron stick to carve on it.As he carved, the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor widened.He saw the names on the bamboo slip.His focus immediately went to the words 'Diamond Sect's ancestor' at the top. His heart skipped a beat as he felt how vindictive Xu Qing was.What made him tremble the most was that although his name had been crossed out, it was different from the other names. The others' names had been crossed out three times, but his name was only crossed once, and it was very faint.'Do you still want to kill me?!' The Diamond Sect's ancestor was horrified. He felt that he had to work hard to become more useful as soon as possible and strive to have more lines on his name.He also saw the new name Xu Qing had written.Idiot.The Diamond Sect's ancestor secretly glanced at the First Peak's youth and deeply agreed.At this moment, the First Peak's youth was heaving a long sigh of relief. He thought to himself that if he hadn't met his master, he would have really lost his life this time.Also, when he saw Old Master Seventh speaking up for the other party earlier, he couldn't help but have some guesses. After that, he noticed Xu Qing's actions and felt intense curiosity.However, he didn't know many poems and usually made up the stanzas randomly. Right now, there were a lot of questions he wanted to ask, but he didn't know how to phrase them.A long time later, he finally spoke."Listen to the sound of the rain during a sleepless night, is the immortal in the sky your father?"Xu Qing ignored this brain-damaged youth. After carving the word 'idiot', he placed the bamboo slip into his pocket and activated the magic ship's protective barrier, instantly isolating the other party's figure.After that, he was about to control the ship to leave this place, when a mournful cry rang out from the distant horizon.Xu Qing instantly looked over. At a glance, he saw that in the direction the two groups had left in, the corpse of a Golden Core cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race who only had half of his body left suddenly fell from the sky and sank in the sea.Xu Qing's eyes immediately narrowed.

Chapter 219 Xu Qing's Dao Protector!
Xu Qing recognized that this falling Sea Corpse Race cultivator was the one who had half of his body destroyed by the First Peak's Peak Lord's sword earlier. The other party was already heavily injured at that time. Clearly, he had been cut down in the subsequent battle.Although it didn't look like he had really died, even if he didn't die, he would definitely be on the verge of death.Xu Qing stared at the surface of the sea where the other party had fallen. His eyes flickered with a glint that was similar to when the captain looked at the flesh of Binding back then. The youth from the First Peak outside his magic ship also looked over with a hesitant expression.Xu Qing fell silent for a few breaths before a decisive expression appeared on his face. The plesiosaur under his magic ship headed straight for the bottom of the sea under Xu Qing's control. Very soon, it saw the falling Sea Corpse Race cultivator.This person was in an extremely miserable state. His lower body and head were all gone, leaving only his upper body. His black blood fused into the seawater, and he was not moving like he had no life left.At the next instant, the Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur bit it. However, at this moment, the broken body suddenly moved. It raised its right hand and pressed down on the approaching plesiosaur.With this push, the plesiosaur's entire body rumbled and directly collapsed. Only the torpedo scad's black bead was left. Immediately after, a new plesiosaur manifested again.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator seemed to have lost all his strength. His right hand hung down and the aura he emitted became even weaker. In fact, because of the attack earlier, more wounds appeared on his broken body.Seeing this scene, Xu Qing quickly performed a series of hand seals with both hands. Immediately, the plesiosaur that had reformed at the bottom of the sea approached again and bit down ruthlessly. This time, although it still collapsed under the attack of the half-dead body, it bit off one of his fingers.However, Xu Qing still didn't go over personally. He continued to reform the plesiosaur. In addition, he didn't hide his attacks, so the First Peak's youth at the side clearly sensed this.The youth originally had some hesitation, but when he saw this scene, his eyes instantly lit up. He swept his gaze across Xu Qing and then looked down at the sea. At the same time, Xu Qing controlled the plesiosaur to attack again.Amidst the rumbling, one of the arms of the Sea Corpse Race's corpse collapsed while the plesiosaur was destroyed. Xu Qing suddenly stood up and was about to rush out.The youth from the First Peak laughed and rushed into the sea before Xu Qing, heading straight for the broken Sea Corpse Race cultivator.Xu Qing stepped into the sea without stopping. He seemed to be moving at full speed but he was holding back. He coldly looked at the back of the First Peak's youth in front of him.Xu Qing didn't plan to go over first. Even though the plesiosaur had probed many times, he was still cautious. He felt that cultivators at the same level as an elder probably had a life-saving method even in such a situation.This was especially so for the strange Sea Corpse Race. Xu Qing had seen their terrifying recovery ability before.Hence, it would naturally be best if someone could investigate first.As for whether the First Peak's youth would be killed… Xu Qing didn't think it was possible.The other party clearly had some life-saving methods hidden. If he really died, Xu Qing would use the shadow to cover himself although he wasn't completely sure of its effectiveness. He could only give it a try when the time came.Xu Qing maintained a certain distance from the other party under the sea. The First Peak's youth got close to the Sea Corpse Race cultivator and performed a series of hand seals with both hands. Immediately, large swords formed and headed straight for the corpse.He wasn't stupid. Although he had rushed out earlier and Xu Qing was about to catch up to him, he felt that there might be a trap. It was just that the temptation was too great, so he wasn't willing to give up. Now that he was close, he was planning to probe first.The dozen or so large swords got close to the corpse and were about to cut it. However, at that moment, the chest of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator suddenly split open and a ball of black blood flowed out. It directly transformed into a malevolent ghost shadow and roared at the First Peak's youth.This roar instantly stirred up a violent force, causing the dozen or so large swords to instantly collapse and shatter inch by inch. At the same time, blood flowed out of the seven apertures of the First Peak's youth. The jade pendant in his hand had long shattered, forming a protective barrier as he rapidly retreated.His expression contained a trace of horror. As he dodged the impact, Xu Qing whistled out from behind him and headed straight for the Sea Corpse Race cultivator. His speed was so fast that he instantly got close.The ghost shadow on the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's chest roared again.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The black umbrella that was hidden in his body opened slightly as he charged forward. A muffled sound rang out from under the sea.Xu Qing's entire body trembled violently and blood flowed out. At the same time, he ruthlessly threw out the dagger formed by the black flames in his right hand and stabbed the ghost shadow.The ghost shadow swayed and black flames filled its entire body. At the same time, a second ghost shadow crawled out of the cultivator's chest and let out a low roar again.Xu Qing's body shook intensely and he was forced to retreat hundreds of feet away. As for the Sea Corpse Race cultivator, he also took this opportunity to speed up his descent, wanting to escape.Xu Qing's eyes flashed with a cold light. From the contact earlier, he could sense a trace of remnant soul on the other party's body. This remnant soul was extremely tempting to him. At the same time, he could faintly see a storage bag on the other party's body.Xu Qing didn't plan to let go of such an opportunity.After all, it was extremely rare to encounter an elder-level existence on the verge of death. Even if there were, there would definitely be a lot of people fighting for it.Xu Qing made a decision. He looked at the Sea Corpse Race's corpse that was rapidly sinking to the bottom of the sea and rushed over.The plesiosaur also arrived and enveloped him, causing Xu Qing's speed to increase. The magic ship also dived into the sea. Golden light flickered on it as the divinity attack was prepared.As for the First Peak's youth, his eyes were wide open as he looked at Xu Qing's figure chasing after the corpse. His thoughts instantly became chaotic. Although he was tempted by the corpse, he felt that it wasn't worth it to risk his life for it.As the ninth highness of the First Peak, he could take appropriate risks but he couldn't choose to risk his life. After all, as long as he followed the prescribed plan, his future would be bright.However… Xu Qing went.He was connected to Xu Qing with the life-linking talisman. The restrictions of this talisman were on both sides. If he died, Xu Qing's soul would dissipate. Similarly, if Xu Qing died, his soul would also dissipate.This made him, who had felt comfortable earlier, instantly feel incomparably anxious.He suddenly felt that his master wasn't that wise and mighty… Hence, he was extremely conflicted at this moment. In the end, he gritted his teeth and cursed in his mind as he followed.Moreover, his speed was even faster. He bit the tip of his tongue that was about to disappear and used the secret technique to transform into a blood sword. He was afraid that if he was too late, this lunatic from the Seventh Peak would lose his life.After catching up to Xu Qing, the First Peak's youth felt extremely aggrieved as he threw a life-saving jade talisman he loved to Xu Qing…Seeing Xu Qing skillfully take the jade talisman, the First Peak's youth wailed in his mind. He felt that he shouldn't have snatched the other party's sea beast on this trip to the sea.Now, under the life-linking talisman, not only did he not feel comfortable, but he also had to become the other party's Dao Protector. He had to risk his life so that Xu Qing would not die.This grievance erupted to the extreme after he saw Xu Qing crashing into the Sea Corpse Race's cultivator. He sped up crazily and had no choice but to attack together with Xu Qing. He had to consider his own protection while also protecting Xu Qing.Just like that, the two of them began an intense battle with the broken body of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator in the sea. Although the other party only had a remnant soul left, the ghost shadow he transformed into was extraordinary. The two of them were heavily injured many times.Xu Qing didn't seem to care about his life. This caused the youth's heart to feel even more aggrieved. He kept giving Xu Qing life-saving jade talismans and even used his trump cards, trying to end this battle as soon as possible.In the end, Xu Qing simply didn't bother to protect himself. He performed hand seals with both hands and released black flames continuously. He continued to attack and absorb traces of the other party's soul power, while he was being desperately protected by the First Peak's youth.If an outsider saw this level of protection, they would definitely be moved.The First Peak's youth fell into despair. He gritted his teeth and retreated, deciding not to protect him. He didn't believe that the other party would really court death.Xu Qing coldly glanced at the youth and didn't bother with him. He continued to attack.A moment later, the First Peak's youth was frightened. He saw that Xu Qing had almost been killed many times, so his mind trembled. He wailed as he hurriedly threw out a protective jade talisman to protect Xu Qing. He then joined the battle again with a bitter expression and fought against the Sea Corpse Race cultivator.He used the madness in his heart on his attacks. The battle lasted for an entire day. When Xu Qing and the ninth highness of the First Peak had exhausted all their means, the remnant soul of the Sea Corpse Race finally couldn't hold on and dissipated. After Xu Qing absorbed more than half of the soul, the other party's storage bag was also taken away by him.However, after returning to the magic ship, the ninth highness of the First Peak directly took out a sword and placed it on his neck. While panting, his eyes revealed a resolute expression as he gritted his teeth and spoke."One incense stick for two tombs in Qingming; if the spoils are not distributed, intestines shall fall!""I don't understand." Xu Qing calmly spoke and kept the storage bag in his arms.The eyes of the ninth highness of the First Peak were red as he stared fixedly at Xu Qing. After holding it in for a long while, he spoke the second proper sentence on this trip to the sea."Split it with me! Otherwise, I'll kill myself!!"Xu Qing calmly looked at the youth. He could see the determination in the other party's eyes. He fell silent for a moment and thought that the other party had indeed helped him a lot when he attacked earlier. The youth had also worked extremely hard to protect him. There were several times when the latter was more like a Dao Protector than a Dao Protector.He opened the storage bag and poured it in front of the other party.Immediately, a large number of items landed. There was a bundle of spirit tickets, a large number of scattered spirit stones, jade slips, pill bottles, and so on. There were even many refining materials. The materials piled up to a significant height.There were two jade talismans that were emitting energy fluctuations. Xu Qing had seen such jade talismans before. They were similar to the life-saving items of the youth. However, it was obvious that the fluctuations from these two jade talismans were much stronger.Xu Qing had seen such an item in the shop at the harbor. This was also a talisman but it wasn't made by a Foundation Building cultivator but by a Golden Core cultivator.Because the Golden Cores were too strong and there were no jade stones that could completely contain the power of their attack, most of the jade talismans only had a small amount of Golden Core power. These two talismans seemed to have been refined not long ago. Clearly, it wasn't for the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's own use. There was no need for him to do so.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  There was a high chance that he had prepared them for someone else.There was also a feather carved from jade that was extremely eye-catching among the items. It shone with a piercing light. When Xu Qing and the ninth highness saw this item, their eyes narrowed."Magic artifact!" Xu Qing was somewhat moved. His Spirit Breath Lantern was a magic artifact and the black iron stick could also be called a magic artifact to a certain extent.Magic artifacts were ranked between runic treasures and magic treasures. They were considered man-made magic treasures. However, there was a wide gap between them and the true magic treasures. They were divided into three ranks: low, middle, and high.However, to cultivators who didn't have any fortuitous encounters to obtain magic treasures, magic artifacts were already extremely good. Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all and grabbed the jade feather. As for the ninth highness of the First Peak, he also lifted his hand. However, what he grabbed wasn't the feather but a very inconspicuous item in this pile of items.It was a metal piece that looked like a box.

Chapter 220 Wish Box
The moment he saw this box, Xu Qing's eyes narrowed.He had seen this box twice.The first time was on the scavenger campsite's Horse-Four, and the other time was on the merfolk youth.However, even now, Xu Qing didn't know what this item was. He also searched the shops in the main city but didn't find anything similar.Now, Xu Qing saw the third one.Almost at the instant Xu Qing looked over, the youth from the First Peak quickly kept this item in his arms. He looked at Xu Qing warily and spoke."300 mouthfuls of blood have been vomited, the most heroic is even distribution of the spoils!""Speak human," Xu Qing said coldly. He then activated the magic ship's protective barrier, stopping the other party from leaving.When the youth from the First Peak saw this, he sighed and punched himself, forcing out a mouthful of black blood. After confirming that he had been poisoned again, he used a secret technique to suppress it and looked at Xu Qing helplessly. He thought to himself that the people from the Seventh Peak were ruthless characters. He actually released poison on his ship. Wasn't he afraid that he would poison himself to death?A long time later, under Xu Qing's calm gaze, the ninth highness of the First Peak sighed and could only speak."We agreed before that you would share the spoils with me. I only want this. The rest is yours."Xu Qing didn't say anything and stored all the items on the ground. When storing them, he found a rainbow-colored token.This token was made of wood and looked like an identity token, but it was slightly damaged.Upon closer inspection, he could see a little sheen on it. Clearly, it was like this because it was often held by someone. He looked at the First Peak's youth."The clouds of the barren expanses rise from the ground…" The First Peak's youth had just said this when he noticed that Xu Qing was frowning. He wailed inwardly and was a little worried that if he didn't speak properly, the other party would choose to attack him again. He endured it and spoke."This is the token of the Seven Sects Alliance. This Sea Corpse Race member we killed should have been a cultivator of the Seven Sects Alliance when he was alive.""What did you take earlier?" Xu Qing asked.The youth hesitated. He could tell that this Seventh Peak disciple in front of him didn't know about the wish box. He originally planned to hide it but when he thought about it, this wasn't considered a secret. Moreover, if the other party misunderstood what a shocking treasure this was, he would probably be in more danger.He shook his head and spoke the truth."This is the wish box.""The so-called wish box is a gift left by the cultivators of the previous era to the cultivators of the next era.""After the god's fragmented face arrived, every era in the Wanggu Continent would come to an end. Hence, such a tradition came to being. Most people would start to forge wish boxes with special materials towards the end of the era, so there have been many wish boxes passed down since ancient times."This First Peak youth wasn't used to speaking normally at first. However, as he spoke, his speech became smoother. He even felt his thoughts moving more freely."The material of the wish box is rather special and can be left behind at the end of the era. However, I heard that in the past, someone obtained a wish box that looked like a coffin, however the cultivator inside had already died. There was also someone who obtained an empty wish box. So, no one knows what exactly is the principle behind it.""Even if there are items, because different experts left them behind and sealed them, no one knows what's inside other than the person who sealed them.""However, I heard that some people have obtained precious resources like magic treasures and cultivation arts from the previous eras. There are also some who have obtained just ordinary leaves. In short, this thing can be said to be priceless or ordinary. At the end of the day, it depends on luck.""I've already opened three of them. My harvests were average but I believe my luck is pretty good.""The method to open it is also simple. Use your magic power to nourish it to the limit and it can be opened.""Usually, this process is very long. The reason why I want this is because it has been nourished and is almost at the point where it can be opened." It was fine if the First Peak's youth didn't speak, but now that he did, he didn't wait for Xu Qing to ask and told him everything he knew.With that, he took a few steps back and looked at Xu Qing warily."If you don't agree, I can give you this item. However, I want that magic artifact and the two jade talismans."Xu Qing fell silent. After some thought, he waved his hand and opened the magic ship's protective barrier. The First Peak's youth understood that Xu Qing was sending him off and hurriedly flew out.After watching the other party leave the magic ship and follow on his large sword, Xu Qing retracted his gaze. He sat down and controlled the magic ship to head to the Seven Blood Eyes.He wanted to return as soon as possible and neutralize the life-linking talisman. Although the shadow could slowly corrode it, this process was extremely slow and Xu Qing didn't want to waste time.At that moment, he began to organize his gains.It had to be said that the richness of the materials in the storage bag of a Golden Core cultivator at the same level as an elder was astonishing. Just the face value of the spirit tickets added up to more than 200,000.Although the spirit tickets weren't distributed by the Seven Blood Eyes, the sect had a place to exchange them. It was just that there would be some reduction in the price but not much.Xu Qing estimated that he could sell the other miscellaneous items for over a hundred thousand spirit stones.As for the two jade talismans, they were sold in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city for tens of thousands of spirit stones. The price depended on their effects.The most valuable thing was the feather magic artifact.This harvest caused Xu Qing's heart to skip a beat. At the same time, he had a faint feeling that the other party's savings were definitely not just this. What he obtained should only be a portion.After all, there was usually more than one storage bag."Unfortunately, the other storage bags might have been snatched away by the killer or placed elsewhere by this cultivator." Xu Qing took a deep breath. After suppressing his guess, he sensed the remnant soul that was being burned like firewood. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes."Let me see how many magic apertures this elder-level remnant soul, which belongs to the Sea Corpse Race that is said to have a shocking effect in the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, can open!"At the thought of this, Xu Qing checked the surrounding defense and glanced at the First Peak's youth who was on guard against him. After that, he closed his eyes and the black fire in his body burned fiercely.Immediately, his 13 magic apertures rumbled at the same time. As flames rose, the burning remnant soul of the Sea Corpse Race surged toward the 14th magic aperture under Xu Qing's control.His magic aperture instantly trembled and was blasted open.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing controlled the remnant soul that was burning like firewood and continued to open the 15th magic aperture!Next was 16, 17…Finally, after the 20th magic aperture was opened, this remnant soul dissipated."It actually opened seven magic apertures!!" Xu Qing's eyes gleamed and his heart raced. Although he had some expectations about this, he was still shocked.The further one opened the magic apertures, the more difficult it would be. Previously, he had sensed that from the tenth magic aperture onwards, the amount of soul power needed to open each one was extremely high.Even so, this remnant soul opened seven of them. This was enough to show how powerful it was. This caused Xu Qing to have a desire to obtain more similar remnant souls."However, the difficulty is still very high." Xu Qing was very clear that the help of the First Peak's youth in this had played a significant role. If it wasn't for the fact that the youth had used many life-saving jade talismans for him and helped from the side, he probably wouldn't have been able to obtain the soul even by now."I've gained a lot this time. I have to return to the sect as soon as possible and remove the life-linking talisman. I'll come out to sea again and strive to form my life fire within a short period!" Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. After sensing the 20 magic apertures in his body, he took out the feather magic artifact as he nurtured these magic apertures.After examining it carefully, he poured magic power into it and began to study it.Time passed and soon, three days passed.While Xu Qing was nurturing his magic aperture and studying the magic artifact, the First Peak's youth, who was following outside the magic ship, finally finished refining the last trace of the wish box.The moment it was completed, he was extremely excited. He quickly glanced at Xu Qing. After sensing that Xu Qing was still cultivating, he deliberately slowed down until he had pulled away from the magic ship. He hurriedly waved his hand and formed a protective barrier that blocked prying vision.Only then did he look at the metal box in his hand.He didn't lie to Xu Qing. He had indeed opened three wish boxes but there was something he didn't say. The first wish box he opened contained an ancient bamboo slip.This ancient bamboo slip didn't have much value by itself, but the content recorded in it concerned the ancient kings and sovereigns.Any item that was related to the ancient kings and sovereigns had astonishing value. This ancient bamboo slip recorded the lives of three ancient kings.Although it was only a description, it still made this First Peak's youth yearn for it endlessly. He especially resonated with the description of the Ancient Mystic Abyss Emperor. It said that he loved to hide mysteries in poetry his entire life.This gave him a lot of inspiration.The youth from the First Peak took a deep breath. After confirming again that Xu Qing wasn't paying attention to this place and that the surroundings were calm, he rubbed his hands first. He then patted his forehead and hammered his chest a few times.It was as though he was doing some kind of prayer ritual, he even had his eyes closed. After the time it took for half an incense stick to burn out, his eyes suddenly opened, revealing a sharp glint. He immediately pried open the box.There was a click.This iron box that had no gaps previously instantly opened like a real box, revealing a finger-sized jade bottle.The bottle was covered in black spots and emitted an ancient feeling. It contained some medicinal liquid. There was also an ancient slip at the side.This scene instantly made the First Peak's youth excited and his heartbeat sped up.This was because over the years, other than the ancient bamboo slip from the first box, he had only obtained useless items in the other two boxes.Now that he saw that other than the ancient slip, there was also a small bottle that seemed to contain medicinal liquid, he was exulted."I've made a killing!" As he muttered, the youth suddenly became vigilant. He felt that he was starting to speak normally now. This immediately alerted him, so he hurriedly changed his words."My miserable life in the sea wasn't in vain, I rose to the top overnight."After muttering again, he finally felt comfortable. He couldn't wait to pick up the small bottle. After looking around, he quickly opened it and took a sniff.Although this item was well-preserved, there was still a rancid smell after it was opened.The First Peak's youth didn't know what this was, but the smell caused him to be invigorated. This was because the smell meant that the liquid inside still had medicinal effects."The great opportunity of the Jade Dragon Heavenly Spirit, only I am blessed!"However, he didn't dare to swallow it directly. He excitedly took another sniff with an intoxicated expression before covering it and looking at the ancient bamboo slip in the box.He took it out and quickly checked it. Very soon, the information inside appeared in his mind."Those who are fated, I wish you well.""I was born in the Mystic Nether Era, and I cultivated the methods of ancient king. I wonder if the God is still around? This box is used to store treasures, but that's beneath me."  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  "My treasure is contained in my bloodline. I hope the finder is a female, thereby giving birth to my heir.""Those who are fated, don't thank me. Goodbye."
