Xu Qing didn't believe the old man's words about selling it to the First Peak.However, the feeling earlier was very real. Xu Qing felt that it wasn't worth it to take the risk to kill him.He had a vigilant personality and decided not to make a move. He was going to observe this place for some time. He glanced at the old man and restrained his killing intent as he calmly spoke."Give me the spirit stones!"Sensing that Xu Qing's killing intent had disappeared, the old man quickly took out three spirit tickets from his pocket. They were worth a total of 3,000 spirit stones. He threw these three spirit tickets to Xu Qing. Xu Qing caught them and checked them. After that, he cut off the heads of the wanted criminals' corpses and left with them.From the start to the end, he only said two sentences.At that moment, as it watched Xu Qing's departing figure, the large snake hurriedly stuck its head out and began to gurgle like it was calling him. Its voice seemed to contain a hint of joy.Xu Qing slowly walked away without looking back."Stop calling, you white-eyed snake. Our spirit stones are all gone, but not only do you not feel heartache, you're even siding with him. He really wanted to kill me just now, and the inn almost woke up!" The old man was filled with grief and indignation as he hurriedly took out an antidote and ate it. "Gurgle!""You are actually saying that I deserved it..." When the old man heard this, he became even more indignant. He flicked his sleeve and sat there smoking his pipe fiercely. Inwardly, he was a little shocked by the killing intent he had sensed earlier."The murderous aura on this kid's body has become even stronger. I wonder what happened on the Sea Lizard Island. I have to ask around!"Xu Qing moved forward silently. The scene at the inn earlier appeared in his mind. The strangeness of this world made him unable to confirm if what the other party said was true or false. However, the danger emitted by the inn felt very real.After walking far away, Xu Qing looked back at Panquan Road. After a while, he retracted his gaze and completely restrained his killing intent.Because the magic boat hadn't finished refining yet, Xu Qing decided to go to the Homicide Department. He wanted to cancel his leave, and planned to stay for the night. In the Homicide Department, Xu Qing saw his captain who had just finished his work and was about to leave.The captain was walking out while eating an apple. When he saw Xu Qing and the three heads in his hand, he narrowed his eyes and smiled before tossing an apple over."You're so hardworking. You went to capture someone as soon as you returned. Didn't you gain much from this trip?"Xu Qing caught the apple and took out a spirit ticket worth 100 spirit stones before passing it over."The harvest was not bad.""I heard that there's an island near the Western Reef Archipelago where many people died. You didn't go there, right?" The captain received the spirit ticket happily. He squatted on a stone chair at the side and asked with interest.Xu Qing glanced at the captain and shook his head.The captain continued to eat his apple and smiled. He didn't continue the topic but started speaking in a deliberately mystifying way."Let me tell you something earth-shattering. After you left, a major case happened here and it caused a heated discussion among many disciples in the city. It was a really tragic death." The captain then looked at Xu Qing as though he was waiting for Xu Qing to ask.Xu Qing also looked at the captain but didn't speak. n(ovelbin[.]nEt After a long time, the captain sighed."Xu Qing, when others speak to you in such a tone, you have to show some curiosity. This way, others won't feel awkward and can continue. This is politeness."Xu Qing fell into deep thought and curiosity appeared on his face.Only then did the captain feel comfortable. After looking around, he whispered."The captain of Team Three of the Earth Division, that fish, was killed by someone.""The Homicide Department investigated this matter. But the guy is from a nonhuman race, so there was only a superficial investigation. But the other party still has Dao Protectors, especially his two sisters. They're searching for the murderer everywhere like crazy...""This world is too chaotic. How could the young master of our ally die just like that? This is a big deal, right? Let's not talk about it anymore, I'm going on night patrol."The captain stood up and patted his clothes before walking away. However, when he walked past Xu Qing, he spoke softly."The merfolk race and the Seven Blood Eyes are allies, so we are letting them search. I heard that... the merfolk race has a spell that can allow the two sisters to sense the tracks of the murderer. They have been searching for more than a month and have investigated everyone who has anything to do with that fish. They should be able to find the murderer soon.""Everyone is watching. This matter is quite interesting." The captain glanced at Xu Qing with a spurious smile and didn't say anything else before leaving the Homicide Department.Xu Qing stood on the spot and pondered.A long time later, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He turned around and handed over the heads of the three wanted criminals to exchange for rewards. He then meditated in the Homicide Department for the night.The next morning, Xu Qing left the Homicide Department and walked on the streets as usual. When he passed by a candied fruit stall, he bought a stick and took a few bites. He then walked into an alley and stopped in his tracks.Very soon, a woman quickly walked over from behind him and knelt down behind Xu Qing."Master."This woman had a graceful figure and looked very seductive. She was his informant back then. Later on, Xu Qing didn't need any more information, so he didn't summon her."Has anything major happened recently?" Xu Qing turned and calmly looked at the woman in front of him.Looking at Xu Qing's candied fruits, the woman's heart trembled. However, very soon, her gaze became fanatical again."Recently, there have been two things that everyone has been discussing the most. One is that the once in 30 years competition between the Seventh Peak's disciples is approaching. Every time the Seventh Peak's competition is held, there will be a storm of blood. It's said that the location that was chosen last time was the merfolk race's island. Their island was covered in blood and later on, they became the Seven Blood Eyes' ally."

Chapter 162 Bizarre Inn (3)
"The second matter is also related to the merfolk race. The young master of their race died and his two sisters have the port for more than a month..."There was a lot of news in the port, and the people who understood them the most were people from all walks of life. After becoming Xu Qing's informant, the woman clearly had key points to focus on investigating the news. Hence, what she said made Xu Qing very satisfied. He thought about it and asked."Anything else?"The informant thought about it and spoke again."There's nothing major. Oh right, some time ago, a small sect moved out of the Seven Blood Eyes' territory. Such a thing is rare. I think it was called the Dia something sect.""The Diamond Sect?" Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he slowly spoke."That's right, it's Diamond Sect." The informant nodded.Xu Qing fell silent. A moment later, he gave the other party five spirit stones and turned to leave.To the woman, five spirit stones was a heavy sum. Her breathing was hurried and when she looked at Xu Qing's back view, she became even more fanatical.After leaving the alley, Xu Qing walked on the streets, pondering about the Diamond Sect's migration."Left?" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and then thought of the merfolk race's matter. From the captain and his informant, he had verified the authenticity of this matter. Killing intent slowly surfaced in his heart."These two things are hidden dangers."Xu Qing muttered inwardly but his expression didn't reveal the slightest killing intent. He calmly ended the day's duty and even made a trip to the Sea Records Library to report the matter of the giant and the dragon carriage.According to the rules of the library, after an information that wasn't recorded was reported and it was confirmed to be true, there would be a reward. However, it would take time to confirm it. Hence, Xu Qing left after reporting it and arrived at Zhang San's Transportation Department at dusk.Over there, he saw Zhang San, who looked exhausted but his gaze contained madness."Junior Brother Xu, your magic boat this time is the most satisfactory work I, Zhang San, have done so far!" Zhang San brought Xu Qing to the warehouse and pushed the door open.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  As the gate opened, an astonishing magic boat was reflected in Xu Qing's eyes. The thousand-foot-long ship was covered in sea lizard skin. As the black light circulated, an aura of the perfected Qi Condensation Realm assaulted his face. The level of its defense could be seen with the naked eye.The original structure didn't change but two huge curved horns extended out from both sides of the ship. It was extremely sinister and at the same time, the sharpness it emitted caused even Xu Qing's eyes to narrow when he sensed it. What was even more astonishing was that the eight sails from before had more than doubled in size. Their structure had also changed. Their color was pitch-black, like the wings of a ferocious beast.Not only that, but the interior of the ship was also covered in Foundation Building sea lizard skin. This caused the sturdiness of this magic boat to exceed what it looked like from the outside. This way, it could create confusion and decide life and death at critical moments."As for the divinity, I've already extracted it for you and fused it into the eight sails of your magic boat. Once it's activated, your magic boat will possess the power to fly and dive into the sea.""The most important thing is that I've connected the divinity to all of your ship. With the help of its life force, your magic boat has a certain level of self-healing ability. This is an extremely precious attribute among all the magic boats of the entire Seven Blood Eyes!""In addition, this divinity can also be stimulated and transformed into a shocking attack. Its might is extremely great. It's hard to say if a Foundation Building cultivator can withstand it, but there's a high chance that they will be heavily injured even if they can. However, I don't recommend you do this. It's too wasteful. After a few times, the divinity will be completely exhausted. Once the divinity is gone, the performance of your ship will also decrease greatly.""It can be said that although your magic boat hasn't advanced to the level of a Foundation Building ship, it's not inferior at all. As long as you add in a Foundation Building core, it will be a true Foundation Building ship and it will be extraordinary!""Therefore, don't rashly put a Foundation Building core in. The best core would be the heart of a powerful ferocious beast. If you can put the heart of a divine creature... then your magic boat won't be much different from a divine creature in the Foundation Building realm!""However, I know that you don't like to show off, so I arranged a cover for you. It can make your boat look the same as before. You can change its appearance at any time!" Zhang San looked at the magic boat with a fanatical expression and introduced it to Xu Qing.Xu Qing gasped. Looking at the colossus in front of him, his heart was filled with shock.Even after a long time, when he left the Transportation Department and returned to Port 79, Xu Qing's mood was still surging.At this moment, in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, there were five figures. Two of them were moving in the front and three in the back, and they were speeding through the night.The two in front were women, and the three people at the back looked like followers. Their eyes were filled with sharpness. These two were the elder sisters of the merfolk youth and also the third highness' lovers.Among them, the younger sister's expression was filled with intense killing intent. As for the older sister, there was a strange look in her eyes. Their thoughts were different but their goals were the same."We searched for more than a month and found everyone who had friction with our brother and marked them out one by one. Only this person is left because he went out to sea!""It's fine. As long as we take a closer look, we'll be able to determine through our bloodline if this kid is the murderer!""If it's really this kid, I'll definitely skin him alive and let him feel the pain of being born in this world. I'll devour his flesh every day and let him die miserably. After that, I'll extract his soul and put it into the merfolk lamp to burn for the rest of its life!" The younger sister gritted her teeth resentfully.The night wind blew, as though the asura was about to claim lives!

Chapter 163 Finally Meeting The Murderer
The night wind was strong. It landed on Xu Qing's magic boat at Port 79 and spread out on the protective barrier, but was unable to pass through.If it could penetrate the protective barrier and blow into the cabin of the magic boat, it would discover that… there was no one there.Far away from the magic boat, in a dark corner under a house, Xu Qing silently leaned against the wall. He crossed his arms and stared coldly at his magic boat.When he closed his eyes and opened them again, a sharpness filled them."Will someone come tonight?" Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the pitch-black sky."It is a night of killing."Xu Qing mumbled softly. However, he kept recalling the image of the vast black cloud and the phoenix eagle in it.When he had gone to retrieve the magic boat, he had asked Zhang San about this. Zhang San didn't know much about it and only told him that this existence was related to the largest forbidden zone in the Nanhuang Continent, the Phoenix Forbidden Zone.It was the emperor of that forbidden zone, named Flame Phoenix!The origin of the term Phoenix Forbidden was also because of it.Its existence was supreme. Not only did it suppress that forbidden zone, but it also suppressed the entire Nanhuang Continent. In fact, the name of the <anno data-annotation-id="c2e09868-dbc9-4436-8946-1d1be9ebb53f">Nanhuang</anno> Continent was also because of it!Located south of the Wanggu Continent, on the Forbidden Sea, there was a divine creature whose might caused the sky to darken and all living beings to revere it. It was known as the Flame Phoenix and lived on an island. Hence, it was named the <anno data-annotation-id="982f64f8-a181-4b55-8ae9-3c7194f10db3">Nanhuang</anno>.As for the details, Zhang San didn't know much either."Flame Phoenix." Xu Qing mumbled inwardly. As he cultivated and came into contact with many things, he gained a greater understanding of this world.The sea breeze blew over. Amidst the wind, there was the sound of clothes fluttering. When it entered Xu Qing's ears, it instantly pulled him back from his reverie. Xu Qing stopped thinking about the Flame Phoenix and looked at the harbor in the distance.Very soon, five figures entered Xu Qing's vision.There were three men and two women.Xu Qing wasn't unfamiliar with the two women in front. Regardless of whether it was the fishy smell from the wind or their figures, Xu Qing recognized them at a glance. These two were the elder sisters of the merfolk youth.Their cultivation was extraordinary. One was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation and the other was at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm.As for the three followers at the back, they were also merfolk cultivators. They looked to be the eighth level of Qi Condensation. The moonlight revealed their faces which were filled with malevolence and killing intent.Xu Qing coldly looked at them and slowly narrowed his eyes. However, he didn't attack immediately. Instead, he looked behind them."Why didn't those Foundation Building Dao Protectors appear?"Xu Qing fell silent. Very soon, the five figures avoided the patrolling disciples and approached Xu Qing's magic boat.Perhaps it was because they felt that they had the backing of the third highness, or perhaps it was because of the arrogance of the merfolk race, the moment they got close to Xu Qing's magic boat, the speed of the younger sister of the two merfolk women suddenly increased as she tried to rush over.However, she was stopped by her big sister. The elder sister was clearly much more rational and didn't act rashly. She took out a talisman.The talisman's effect seemed to be probing and not offensive.A few breaths later, the two merfolk women sensed that there was no one on the boat and turned back, looking like they were about to leave.The coldness in Xu Qing's eyes dissipated. The reason why he left the boat was because he didn't want to kill in his boat. Once he killed in his magic boat, the traces would be too obvious and there would be many future troubles.Naturally, if these few people really barged in, Xu Qing would adapt to it. He stared at the five merfolk and waited for them to leave. His plan was to secretly follow them and assassinate them one by one and destroy their corpses.However, just as the five of them were about to leave and Xu Qing was about to take a step in the dark, the expression of the older sister of the two merfolk women changed. She abruptly looked at Xu Qing's hiding place."There's the bloodline curse fluctuation of brother's death there!"As soon as the woman spoke, her younger sister also looked over. Her green eyes were filled with killing intent as she charged toward Xu Qing. The three followers in the surroundings also showed intense killing intent as they sped over."I was discovered?" Xu Qing frowned slightly. The other party was the third highness' men. If he started a fight here, it would attract attention. In addition, he also had to consider these merfolk people sending messages to others.Hence, the instant the other party rushed over, Xu Qing rapidly retreated while restraining his aura. He put on a panicked expression to numb the other party and let them be certain of their victory so that they wouldn't transmit messages to others immediately.Xu Qing didn't plan to delay for too long. He was going to find a remote place before he made a move.The five merfolk cultivators chased after him at high speed.The younger sister was at the front with a ferocious glint in her eyes. With a wave of her hand, black bubbles appeared beside her. She threw them toward Xu Qing, who was fleeing in panic, with killing intent.These bubbles that emitted fluctuations of spells and anomalous substances rapidly approached Xu Qing, as though they wanted to taint Xu Qing."So it is you who killed my clan's younger brother. I'll make you wish you were dead!"As she spoke, the three merfolk followers behind her each took out their weapons with sinister expressions. One held a bone sword, one's hands were covered in scales that transformed into poisonous spikes, and the other had sarcomas growing on his back that tore his clothes apart, emitting a dense poisonous fog that transformed into the shadow of a malicious ghost which chased after Xu Qing.The elder sister was at the back. She was cautious by nature, so she didn't chase too closely. She even habitually took out her talisman to protect herself.Xu Qing ignored the spells behind him and sped up.When those spells were about to reach him, he had already arrived at a remote corner. Only then did he stop moving forward. He suddenly turned around and his eyes revealed killing intent. His speed instantly erupted, several times faster than before as he directly slammed behind him.His figure was so fast that he arrived in front of the furious merfolk sister in the blink of an eye. He ignored the anomalous substances in the bubbles and before the other party's expression could change, Xu Qing ruthlessly slammed into the woman's chest.Even though this woman was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation and had the talent of the merfolk race, in the face of Xu Qing's physical strength that surpassed Qi Condensation and his powerful spirit energy, her body was like paper. The instant Xu Qing touched her…the woman's eyes widened. Before she could even let out a scream, her body collapsed.Flesh and blood splattered everywhere as her entire body was smashed into pieces. Only her head flew up and was enveloped by a ball of blue light. It seemed to have retained her life force and was retreating rapidly.Xu Qing took a look and with a wave of his hand, the black iron stick flew out, heading straight for the head. He didn't stop at all as he appeared in front of the follower who was holding the bone sword.At the same time that the follower's expression changed, Xu Qing had already grabbed his bone sword and broke it.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Xu Qing flipped the broken end of the sword blade and stabbed it into the follower's neck, slashing it open.This follower at the eighth level of Qi Condensation died instantly with blood spurting out of his neck.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing took a step forward and arrived beside another follower whose sarcomas were emitting poisonous gas.This follower was already retreating with panicked breathing. However, after taking a few steps back, his body trembled and his entire body turned greenish-black. He spat out a mouthful of blood and died from the poison.Compared to Xu Qing's poison, his poison was insignificant.At the same time, the last follower's mind also rumbled with shock. His body trembled intensely in fright. Just as he was about to let out a scream, countless water droplets suddenly appeared in the surroundings and enveloped his entire body. They then pressed him from all sides, turning him into a blood mist.The black iron stick also caught up to the younger merfolk sister's head that was enveloped by the blue light and stabbed it.However, this blue light runic treasure was astonishing. It flickered rapidly and actually resisted the power of the iron stick. However, the impact still caused half of the head to collapse.However, because of her nonhuman innate talent, this merfolk woman didn't die immediately. She let out a blood-curdling cry and borrowed the force of the impact to fly toward her big sister.All of this happened in the blink of an eye. Xu Qing's attacks were extremely ruthless and decisive. As he killed three people in a row, there was also a dagger that emitted a cold light that whistled through the air, heading straight for the elder merfolk sister in the distance.It was already near her.The expression of this elder merfolk sister completely changed to that of unprecedented horror that she even felt the deaths of her companions earlier were not real.However, she was cautious by nature and had the habit of using talismans to protect herself. Coupled with her cultivation at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, she showed no signs of being poisoned. Although the force of the dagger was great, it still couldn't instantly break through her talisman's defense.Amidst the rumbling, the body of the elder merfolk sister under the protection of the talisman trembled.She really couldn't imagine that such a terrifying existence was hiding in this seemingly ordinary Port 79. In her perception, such combat strength was no different from a Foundation Building cultivator.At the thought that she had actually brought people to find trouble with this person, her scalp started to turn numb. She even cursed her dead clan brother in her heart."So be it if you died, why did you have to provoke such a malignant star!!"At this critical moment, she didn't hesitate at all. She immediately took out another talisman and threw it forward. Immediately, a rumbling sound echoed as the talisman transformed into a huge fishtail that swung fiercely at Xu Qing.Taking advantage of this opportunity, the merfolk woman grabbed her younger sister's head that showed signs of being poisoned and was on the verge of death. Her cultivation base rotated madly as she fled.Her fear had long transformed into a huge wave that drowned her mind. There was only one thought in her mind now, and that was to escape!Flee till the Dao Protectors arrived.According to the agreement, the Dao Protectors should have arrived by now. She quickly took out the voice transmission jade slip and sent a message to the Dao Protectors.However, she didn't have the time to check if the other party had received her message. Right now, she was burning her cultivation base to increase her speed to the extreme. She did not even hesitate to take out another talisman to break through Xu Qing's rain barrier.There were loud explosions.If they were at the port, they would definitely be discovered. However, this place was remote and was blocked by Xu Qing's rain. Moreover, the fight was extremely fast, so no sound was spread.Very soon, Xu Qing stepped out from behind the huge fishtail. His expression was cold as he looked at the fleeing merfolk woman in the distance and chased after her.His speed erupted completely and he also took out his flight talisman, causing his speed to be like a bolt of lightning.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="c2e09868-dbc9-4436-8946-1d1be9ebb53f">The Huang(凰) in Nanhuang is the same character as the Phoenix(凰).</li><li data-annotation-id="982f64f8-a181-4b55-8ae9-3c7194f10db3">Nanhuang(南凰) Southern Phoenix/ Phoenix of the South.</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 164 Emerging Above The 50 (1)
The night was as quiet as stagnant water.The wind was as sharp as a blade.In this silent night, Xu Qing's figure pierced through the night like a blade.Since he had already made the move, Xu Qing couldn't care less. These merfolk cultivators had taken the initiative to find him, so he could only kill him!Even though the other party was the third highness' men, since they had attacked him, Xu Qing was prepared to offend the third highness.If the worst comes to the worst… he would head out to sea overnight after killing everyone and leave the Seven Blood Eyes.Although it was a pity, Xu Qing didn't hesitate much at this point.He got closer and closer to the fleeing merfolk woman.​ However, this merfolk woman's cultivation base wasn't ordinary and she had many talismans. She didn't even hesitate to burn her cultivation base. In fact, after sensing that Xu Qing was about to reach her, she used three talismans that looked like flight talismans in fear of her life.This allowed her speed to reach an extremely astonishing level.In an instant, the distance between her and Xu Qing widened greatly and she arrived at the harbor.Although she had distanced herself, this small gap wasn't enough to make her relax. Her mental capacity had long reached its limit with the death of her followers and her sister in a dying state.Xu Qing's ruthlessness caused her to feel an unprecedented sense of danger. The coldness in his eyes made her tremble intensely.It was only when she saw the familiar magic boat in front of her at the harbor that the crisis in her heart eased and hope appeared in her eyes.She no longer thought about why the Dao Protectors didn't come. At this moment, all she wanted to do was to step onto the magic boat ahead as soon as possible and be under the protection of her lover."You killed my clan brother and my clansmen, and caused me to be in such a sorry state. Xu Qing… I'll definitely get the third highness to expel you from the Seven Blood Eyes. That will be my time to take revenge!"The merfolk woman gritted her teeth and her eyes turned red. She even began to burn her bloodline and her speed soared again.Xu Qing's gaze grew increasingly cold. He knew the direction the other party was heading in. That was where the third highness' magic boat was anchored. Even from afar, Xu Qing could see the third highness' huge and luxurious magic boat.It was brightly lit and the sound of singing and dancing could be heard.The killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes intensified. He didn't care about the expenditure, as he burned the flight talismans in exchange for an even faster speed. However, he was still a little slow in the end.Ten breaths later, the merfolk woman finally got close to the third highness' magic boat under the speed boost of her bloodline and cultivation burning. She immediately jumped onto the boat. As she landed on the boat, her body staggered and she let out a miserable cry for help. "Sir Li, save me!!"As the voice rang out, many of the third highness' followers immediately rushed out of the magic boat and guarded the surroundings.The third highness also quickly walked out of the cabin and arrived beside the merfolk woman."Honey, why are you crying? Who bullied you?"The third highness looked at his pitiful lover who was in a sorry state. His heart ached as he gently helped her up and saw her sister's dying head at the side."What happened?" The third highness' face revealed anger.At the same time, Xu Qing caught up and arrived outside the third highness' magic boat. He stood on the sea with a cold expression as he looked at the merfolk woman who was being helped up by the third highness."It's this person! Sir Li, it's Xu Qing who killed my clan brother. My sister and I went to reason with him, but this villain cruelly destroyed my sister's body and killed many of my clansmen. Even I had no choice but to burn my bloodline to escape this calamity.""Sir Li, you have to uphold justice for me. Be it from an individualistic perspective or the alliance perspective, my merfolk race won't let this matter rest, especially for my sister. Look at what state she has fallen into." The merfolk woman was filled with grief and indignation. She gritted her teeth and pointed at Xu Qing on the surface of the sea.At this moment, the younger sister's head in her hand slowly woke up. She looked at the third highness with her dying breath and cried."Such nerves, you're really courting death!" When the third highness heard this, his expression turned cold and he slowly spoke.The surrounding followers also emitted murderous intent.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Xu Qing fell silent. At that moment, the sea breeze blew over, causing his Daoist robe to rustle. His long hair also fluttered in the wind. He looked at the third highness and then at the sea outside the harbor, making a decision in his heart.The merfolk woman finally heaved a sigh of relief in her heart. When she looked at Xu Qing, her eyes revealed intense resentment.She had already thought of how to deal with the other party next. She even felt that her sister's words back then were a little soft-hearted. She wanted to inflict on him a punishment ten times worse than her sister had said and make this person regret coming to this world."Thank you, Sir Li. Please…" The merfolk woman's eyes were filled with viciousness. Before she finished speaking, the third highness gently interrupted."Honey, you're mistaken. I was saying, how dare you, honey.""Sir Li, you…" The merfolk woman was stunned. She lifted her head and looked at the third highness. What she saw was still that familiar face. It was no different from before. In fact, his expression still contained the heartache from earlier. His gaze was also extremely gentle, seemingly containing deep love.This made her think that she had heard wrongly. Just when she was about to speak again, the third highness gently lifted his left hand and patted the top of her head as usual.The merfolk woman's entire body trembled and her head shattered into pieces.

Chapter 165 Emerging Above The 50 (2)
Her squashed eyes, that were covered in blood and flesh, drowned out her gaze. She fell to the ground and her life was extinguished.This scene caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow. He was extremely surprised.As for the younger merfolk sister who was dying and crying, she was completely stunned.The remaining weakness on her face was instantly replaced by an intense expression of confusion, as though she couldn't believe what she was seeing.This was especially so since the gentleness and love on the third highness' face did not change at all as he wiped the blood on his hands.The younger merfolk sister was extremely confused.She couldn't imagine that the man who had once hugged them in his arms and was very close to them would actually smack her sister to death with such gentleness.Had his expression changed when he attacked or showed coldness, she could accept it.However, the expression of this man in front of her was filled with love from the start. This caused the younger merfolk sister to feel an unprecedented wave of feelings."Sir Li..." The younger merfolk sister's eyes were filled with horror.As the third highness wiped his hands, he smiled gently at the younger merfolk sister. He then looked at Xu Qing, his expression gentle as usual."I'm sorry, Junior Brother. Is there anything else?"Xu Qing's hair stood on end. He looked at the gentle and smiling third highness and shifted his gaze to the corpse on the deck before looking at the head of the younger sister who was terror-struck.This merfolk woman's head was clearly deeply poisoned and she wouldn't live for long.Xu Qing fell silent. A deep chill rose in his heart. The third highness' actions and words really made Xu Qing feel a chill run down his spine. He had never seen such a person.This outcome was something he hadn't expected. In fact, Xu Qing was even prepared to escape from the Seven Blood Eyes earlier. He looked at the third highness' genial face in silence. After a long time, he cupped his fists and bowed to the third highness.He then left with intense vigilance.After he reached far away, he looked back at the third highness who was standing on the deck. The scene of the other party smacking the merfolk woman to death with a gentle expression appeared in his mind.Xu Qing fell silent. He felt that the third highness was an extremely dangerous person!The third highness still had a gentle smile on his face. It was only after he watched Xu Qing leave that he turned to look at the head of the younger merfolk sister on the ground. His gaze was filled with gentleness and deep love as he spoke softly."Honey, you two sisters are so obedient. Not only did you help me complete my Master's mission, but you also made that little fiend owe me one. Not bad, not bad, I like you guys even more."The third highness' voice was gentle but when his words entered the ears of the younger sister's head, her expression changed and there was even deeper horror in her eyes. Just as she was about to speak, the third highness lifted his foot and stepped on the head.Kichhh, the head shattered."Sigh, in the future, I can only reminisce about your softness." The third highness revealed a regretful expression. The followers in the surroundings lowered their heads, not daring to look at the third highness. They quickly cleaned the flesh and blood on the deck.Very soon, after the entire deck was clean again, a retainer brought a crystal bottle to the third highness and respectfully spoke in a low voice."Third highness, those few Dao Protectors of the merfolk race have been captured along with the stolen goods.""Very good." The third highness smiled."Go and deliver a message to the merfolk race. I've helped them suppress the matter of stealing the design of our sect's magic boat, and in return, I need an ancient tear of the merfolk royal family. Tell them to send it to me as soon as possible." With that, he took the crystal bottle and drank a mouthful of the nourishing water inside. After handing it back, he stepped forward and walked in the air. His entire person transformed into a rainbow that headed straight for the Seventh Peak.Not long later, his figure appeared at the top of the Seventh Peak.In the main hall at the top of the mountain, Old Master Seventh was sitting in front of a chessboard, thinking hard. His opponent was a servant."You made the wrong move!" After a long while, Old Master Seventh looked up at the servant solemnly. When the servant heard this, he lowered his head and picked up the chess piece, placing it on the other side."Why are you taking back your move? Do you know that taking back your move counts as a loss? You lost!" After Old Master Seventh finished speaking, he waved his hand and disrupted the chess pieces. His gaze then landed on the third highness who had arrived. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Greetings, Master." The third highness' expression was completely different from before. At this moment, he was extremely respectful as he knelt on the ground and bowed deeply."What's the matter!" Old Master Seventh said calmly."Master, I've investigated the merfolk race. Although there was an accident in the process, it still went smoothly at the end of the day.""They were trying to steal the refining design of our Seventh Peak's magic boat for the Sea Corpse Race. While we caught them red-handed, I also confirmed that the merfolk race secretly built a skeleton tower to curry favor with our mortal enemy, the Sea Corpse Race.""This is the evidence. In addition, there are four deacons in the sect who were bribed by the merfolks. The name list is also here." The third highness took out a jade slip and respectfully handed it over with both hands.Old Master Seventh grabbed the jade slip from the distance and scanned through it. He then looked at his disciple below. His expression turned colder.The third highness' body started to tremble. After a while, he said in a low voice."There's also a matter that this disciple wishes to apologize for. That merfolk race's son tortured and killed the children of commoners of my Seven Blood Eyes. His sisters cooperated in this. This disciple misjudged this matter previously. Master, please punish me.""The rules can't be broken. Enter closed-door cultivation in the Candle Bone Cave for seven days." Old Master Seventh's expression softened as he slowly spoke.Upon hearing the words 'Candle Bone Cave', the third highness' heart trembled. He lowered his head and nodded before bidding farewell.After watching his disciple leave, Old Master Seventh stood up and looked at the harbor at the foot of the mountain. He seemed to be looking at Port 79 as he fell deep in thought.A long time later, he lifted his head and looked into the distance in the direction of the sea.The servant at the side spoke softly."The merfolk race isn't stupid. It's probably impossible for them to brazenly send people to steal the blueprint of the magic boat...""The youngest is greedy. I naturally know what he's doing, but he would not dare to falsify the evidence of the skeleton tower," Old Master Seventh slowly said.,m "The merfolk race has been so close to our Seven Blood Eyes' mortal enemy, the Sea Corpse Race, all these years. Their wolfish ambitions are already very obvious. The deaths of our disciples, who sacrificed their lives to resolve the crisis of their race years ago, were not worth it.""Since that's the case, we have to take back everything with interest." A cold glint appeared in Old Master Seventh's eyes.* * *Chapter title explanation.Old Master Seventh had given out fifty white tokens to disciples he thought highly of. In the cruel environment at the foot of the mountain where schemes and killings were common, he stood out from these 50 wolf cubs.He was the ever gentle third highness.

Chapter 166 Trip To The Red Plains (1)
Old Master Seventh retracted his gaze after a long time."Come, let's continue."The servant nodded. After setting up the chessboard, he hesitated for a moment before speaking in a low voice."Old Master Seventh, about the third highness and that kid…" Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  Old Master Seventh glanced at the servant and calmly spoke."You are paying a lot of attention to the kid."The servant lowered his head and didn't speak."It's the youngest's nature to be unscrupulous. He usually looks gentle but in reality, he doesn't have any feelings. This is how he stood out from the crowd and became my disciple. It's also what I think highly about him.""As for the kid, whether he can see through the youngest's thoughts or whether he can figure out something from here will depend on his wisdom. In this chaotic world, fools won't be able to live for long."After Old Master Seventh finished speaking, he looked at the sky. Dawn was about to arrive.In Port 79, Xu Qing sat on the deck of his magic boat with a contemplative look. As the sun rose and the first rays of the morning dissipated the night sky, the moment they landed on him, Xu Qing's gaze became deep."Firstly, 30 years ago, the competition was held on the merfolk race's island. After that, the merfolk race became allies and the relationship between the two sides was naturally one of dubious unity. Moreover, that day in the Sixth Peak's store, when the merfolk youth saw the second highness, his expression was filled with fear. This means that there's a high chance that the second highness killed a lot of merfolks in the competition 30 years ago.""Secondly, the disciples of the seven peak lords would probably not openly go against their masters' intentions. The second highness' attitude towards the merfolk youth clearly shows the problem. In that case, the third highness' action of killing the merfolks can be understood!""If so, why did the third highness invite the merfolks to the Seven Blood Eyes? Bringing them here and killing them… and doing it in front of me.""Third highness has other motives. If I were the third highness, why would I do this? In what kind of situation would I kill someone in front of others?"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed in focus. After a long time, he got an answer."There's only one situation where I would do this. I want to use the evidence against the merfolk race to blackmail them. If I don't have any evidence, I'll create it! At the same time, the reason I'll kill them in front of someone is to increase the value of killing. While extorting the merfolk race, I will also be selling a favor to that person." "The prerequisite is that this person has value."Xu Qing recalled the scene when his captain told him about the incident on Sea Lizard Island with a spurious smile. The other party clearly had some information channels he didn't know about.If the captain had it, the third highness might have it too.Xu Qing recalled that when he escaped from Sea Lizard Island, there were auras that had locked onto him. Back then, he was at the bottom of the sea and couldn't see who they were. At this moment, his eyes gleamed as he had more guesses."Since the Seven Blood Eyes allowed this to happen, it can only mean that… they are going to battle the merfolk race!" "No matter what, I have to leave for some time!"Xu Qing wasn't sure if his analysis was completely correct. He planned to leave for some time and see if there was a follow-up to this matter. If everything was really calm, it wouldn't be too late for him to return.He was only one step away from becoming a tenth level Qi Condensation cultivator. If he broke through to the Foundation Building realm in the future, he would have the qualifications to ascend the mountain and the right to gain the benefits of the Seven Blood Eyes.He would earn at least 5,000 spirit stones a month. Moreover, as long as the Seven Blood Eyes existed, he could continue to obtain them. This had tempted Xu Qing for a long time. Of course, compared to this, survival was more important.Xu Qing didn't hesitate and chose to leave first and observe.Moreover, he felt that he could make use of this time to do something major that had been buried in his heart for a long time.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He wanted to completely remove the thorn in his flesh.That was… the Diamond Sect's ancestor.If he didn't kill this person, it would be difficult for Xu Qing to get a good sleep.Xu Qing didn't waste any time. When dawn broke, he stored the magic boat and headed straight for the Homicide Department."The Diamond Sect is a sect after all. Even though they are relatively weak, it's very difficult to hide their whereabouts when they migrate. To the Seven Blood Eyes, all the movements in its sphere of influence are no secret."As a member of the Homicide Department, Xu Qing had the right to read the records in the department. He knew that a large portion of them recorded the changes within the range of influence of Seven Blood Eyes.Although the details weren't as detailed as the Intelligence Department, it was easier for Xu Qing to check the records here than to go check them in the Intelligence Department.After he arrived at the Homicide Department, he headed straight for the archives.His reputation in the Homicide Department was even greater than the outside world. Other than his outstanding performance in the Night Dove operation, this reputation was built from the heads of one wanted criminal after another.Hence, the disciple in the archives was very polite and allowed Xu Qing to check the records alone. Not long later, Xu Qing finally found the clues he wanted from some messy news that the Seven Blood Eyes didn't value."Joined the Litu Sect?"Xu Qing looked at the record in front of him and his eyes slowly narrowed. The people of the Litu Sect were all crazy people. The attitudes of the other forces toward the Litu Sect were one of disgust and wariness. They would often stay far away and not interact much with them."This shouldn't be because of me. It should be because the compensation gift that the second highness wanted back then was too heavy, so much so that after the Diamond Sect paid the price, their foundation was greatly damaged and their future was bleak, so they didn't dare to stay in the Seven Blood Eyes' territory."Xu Qing stroked his chin and memorized the movements of the Diamond Sect recorded in the file. He then left the Homicide Department.

Chapter 167 Trip To The Red Plains (2)
Xu Qing silently walked on the streets of the port. He went to a few shops and sold the miscellaneous items and a portion of the sea lizard skins he had obtained on Sea Lizard Island. He also bought some items he needed for the trip and even bought a lot of poisonous herbs.Finally, he stood outside a shop that specialized in selling talismans. After some thought, he suppressed his heartache for the spirit stones and stepped in.A moment later, when he walked out, he had a special talisman on him. This talisman could change a person's aura and appearance. Although it wasn't perfect, it was enough for Xu Qing to use on this trip.It was noon. Although winter had arrived, the geographical location of the Seven Blood Eyes caused the winter here to be warm. The sunlight was still hot and slightly dazzling.Under this sunlight, Xu Qing's figure disappeared into a corner of an alley. When he came out from the other end, his appearance had changed. He was no longer delicate and handsome but a long-faced youth with a sallow complexion. The Daoist robe he wore had also been changed to an ordinary long robe.The cultivation fluctuations on his body also changed to the third level of Qi Condensation.He was very clear about the outside world. Most people at the ninth level of Qi Condensation had statuses and were very conspicuous. Only scavengers at the third level of Qi Condensation had a certain level of deterrence and wouldn't attract attention.After sensing the transformation power of the talisman, Xu Qing became vigilant of his surroundings. However, his face was expressionless as he walked toward the teleportation array.He didn't use his identity token, but paid directly with the spirit stones. Not long later, Xu Qing, who was standing in the teleportation array and warily checking the surroundings, was drowned by the sea of light and disappeared.The eastern part of the Nanhuang Continent was at least tens of thousands of kilometers away from the former Diamond Sect's territory. This was an area with a vast land and few people.Because a type of red dentate grass grew in this wilderness, it was known as the Red Plains.From afar, the entire land seemed to be dyed in blood. At the same time, the anomalous substances permeating the air here were also slightly denser than in the other wildernesses in the Nanhuang Continent which resulted in the ferocious beasts here becoming even more violent and powerful.There were naturally not many cities in this harsh environment. There might only be one within hundreds of miles. Moreover, the buildings and styles were mostly primitive and crude. The slums here were also mostly made up of scavengers.Regardless of whether it was the terrain or the population, the Red Plains was a rather abominable place. Hence, the various families of Purple Earth didn't fancy it, and the Seven Blood Eyes didn't care either. Only the Litu Sect preferred to develop in such abominable areas because of their doctrines.Hence, the Red Plains became the territory of the Litu Sect.At the edge of the Red Plains, in the center of a crude city, the only teleportation array in the Red Plains that was jointly set up by Purple Earth and the Seven Blood Eyes shone.A sallow-faced middle-aged cultivator in a long black robe appeared in the teleportation array.He was none other than Xu Qing, who had used the disguise talisman to transform his appearance.As soon as he arrived, a rotting and nauseous stench assailed his nose. If it was someone who hadn't experienced much hardship, they would feel somewhat uncomfortable with this smell.However, to Xu Qing, this was the norm in the place he was once in. It was just that the rotting smell here was a little stronger.Xu Qing's expression was calm. Under the indifferent gazes of the few lazy guards in the surroundings, he walked out of the teleportation array.All the buildings in the city were grayish-black and dilapidated. The ground was filled with all kinds of trash and feces.There were very few people in the city and most of them were very vigilant toward each other.There were very few women, and they all had fierce expressions. There were also children hiding in some corners of alleys. There was no innocence in their eyes, only a dying aura and coldness.From time to time, screams and curses rang out in the city. "It feels more like a scavenger campsite."Xu Qing's gaze swept across the surroundings as he walked forward.On the way, Xu Qing ignored the gazes that were filled with caution and fawning. He didn't stay long in this city either. After leaving the city, he sped toward the wilderness. Read m0re at nOνEℓnEXт  The location of the Diamond Sect's migration was on the Red Plains. However, it was somewhat far from the city Xu Qing had teleported to.Before coming here, Xu Qing had observed the map of this place in the Homicide Department. Now, he locked onto a direction and ran.His speed was very fast. The wind that blew across his face carried a bone-piercing chill, and there seemed to be some snowflakes mixed in. There were even some small hills in the distance that were covered by thin snow.While it was a warm winter in the Seven Blood Eyes, it was a cold winter here.This coldness awakened many of the memories in Xu Qing's mind, especially when he saw many ferocious beasts and human bones on the way."Chaotic world." Xu Qing's gaze was calm as he sped up.Time flowed by and the night arrived. As the night chill permeated the air, the wind grew stronger and the snow became fiercer. Xu Qing, who had left the city and entered the Red Plains, suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked into the distance.The wind blew over, bringing with it a hint of malevolence and bloody stench.He could see corpses on the distant ground amidst the snow, along with scattered goods and shattered carriages.This was clearly a convoy heading to the city.There were more than ten desperadoes with tattered clothes and disheveled hair beside the corpses. Their expressions and gazes were savage and bloodthirsty. Most of them emitted fluctuations of the second or third level of Qi Condensation.Some of them were making sure the corpses were completely dead, some were rummaging for items, and some were dragging the corpses into the distance. There were also a few who were lying on top of a few naked female corpses to vent their bestial nature.Further away, there was a glow of fire and it looked like food was being cooked. There was also some lingering heat following the wind.Clearly, this convoy had encountered a group of fugitives and died tragically.Xu Qing's arrival immediately aroused the vigilance of these desperadoes. They all stopped what they were doing and glared at Xu Qing.After sensing Xu Qing's third level of Qi Condensation cultivation, these desperadoes laughed sinisterly. Their ferocity erupted and they charged toward Xu Qing without saying a word.They felt that Xu Qing was a prey.Xu Qing coldly looked at these desperadoes. To him, he had seen too many massacres since he was young. His experience as a scavenger allowed him to know that the so-called convoys that dared to travel in the wilderness had very few good people. When they encountered the weak, they could transform into plunderers at any time.This was how the chaotic world was. Killing and being killed were very common. He didn't have that much sympathy to investigate who was good and who was evil.However… since these people were attacking him, he was not going to stay still.

Chapter 168 The Worried Ancestor
In the black sky, a crescent moon hung high up. The cold moonlight was like a sharp blade that slashed down on the ground, stirring up the wind as it whistled past.This wind blew up some of the snow on the ground, merging with the blade light falling from the sky. It swept in all directions, causing the grass in the Red Plains to bend slightly.Xu Qing's figure moved forward like a ghost. As the cold light from the dagger shone in the night, boiling blood splattered everywhere from the desperadoes' bodies, landing on the red grass that was bent by the wind.However, the evil contained in this blood was not qualified to melt the cold nor lower the temperature of the wind on this winter night. It was despised by even the red grass; they used the wind to bend down and shake the blood off their bodies drop by drop.Corpses fell one after another.The dagger in Xu Qing's hand became the last light in their lives.As the dagger blade flashed, the neck of the last outlaw was sliced open by Xu Qing's saber. Xu Qing stood there with corpses strewn all over the ground.Everyone was killed with a single strike.All the attacks were on the neck.This was because cutting the neck was the most convenient and fastest. The only flaw was that the blood that splattered everywhere dyed his robe which caused Xu Qing to frown slightly.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 However, the killing intent in his gaze didn't decrease because of the blood on his clothes. Since he had made a move, he would kill them all.Even if the fugitives here might not have the ability to take revenge, Xu Qing didn't like to be careless and didn't like to leave any hidden dangers.It was fine if he didn't make a move, but since he did, he didn't want to expose any traces of himself.Xu Qing held the dagger and walked toward the place where there was an uproar due to the massacre here.In front of him was the place where the remaining warmth from cooking drifted over. There were seven to eight desperadoes surrounding a large pot. They were originally drinking soup but after seeing the massacre, they stood up in horror and looked at Xu Qing fearfully.Xu Qing also looked at them.The snowflakes on the ground were covered in traces left behind from dragging corpses. However, there were no corpses, only some clothes that had been removed.Xu Qing knew very well where the corpses went.He wasn't unfamiliar with the fragrance of meat that was drifting in the wind. When he was in the slums, he had smelled it from afar. Back then, the first person he killed was because the other party wanted to eat him.Xu Qing's gaze swept past the large pot beside these seven to eight desperadoes and he continued walking.In that instant, the expressions of the seven to eight desperadoes changed as they rapidly retreated. They wanted to escape, but the one who escaped the fastest didn't manage to run far before a black iron stick arrived at lightning speed. It pierced through the back of his head.At the next moment, Xu Qing quickened his pace and suddenly rushed over. The dagger in his hand shone with the moonlight and seemed even colder in the wind and snow. He slit open the neck of a desperado and caught up to the second person."Friend, don't be rash…"Heads flew up!"We made a mistake. We were blind. We're willing to apologize!!"A blood line appeared on his neck!"I'll fight it out with you!!"The head collapsed!The entire massacre lasted for only five breaths of time before the world fell silent. The wind blew and snow continued to fall amidst the lonely moonlight. The corpses on the ground completely dyed the soil red, turning it into a true Red Plains.Looking at the corpses in the surroundings, Xu Qing wiped his dagger on one of them and began to deal with it.Very soon, the corpses here turned into blood and fused into the ground. Xu Qing glanced at the huge pot and silently extinguished the fire.He suddenly understood why there was an endless stream of people who wanted to stay in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city despite having to pay expensive contribution points every day in exchange for residency.In this chaotic world, human lives were worthless.Xu Qing turned and continued his journey. The blizzard grew even heavier that night. Snowflakes fell from the sky and rapidly slid down in front of Xu Qing, who was running. A cold wind blew over, lifting his long hair as it attempted to enter through his clothes.Xu Qing frowned slightly and tightened his clothes. He then exhaled a mouthful of white fog and lowered his head slightly before continuing forward.Just like this, a night passed.When the morning arrived, Xu Qing, who had been rushing for the entire night, finally saw a mountain in the distance.As a plain, Red Plains didn't have many mountains. Most of them were rather short and didn't look like mountains. Only the one in front of him was somewhat okay. However, compared to the mountain that Diamond Sect was located on back then, the difference was extremely great.Regardless of whether it was in terms of elegance or solemnity, they were on different levels.Some newly built halls could be seen on the peak. However, they were clearly desolate as though there weren't many disciples in the sect and the entire sect seemed to emit bleakness."Diamond Sect?" Xu Qing pondered. According to the clues he had checked, this mountain was the new location of the Diamond Sect.Clearly, not everyone could adapt to the changes in the environment, especially when they moved to the Red Plains, which was even more harsh and barren than their previous location. Naturally, fewer people could accept it.In addition, they hadn't been here for long, so the desolate atmosphere of the Diamond Sect could be explained.However, Xu Qing was very cautious. He wouldn't let down his guard just because he saw that the Diamond Sect was in decline. He wasn't clear about the internal situation of the sect and didn't know if it was really as he saw.Hence, Xu Qing didn't plan to rush over and attack immediately. He wanted to observe first.Just like a hunter hunting, he couldn't be anxious.Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the Diamond Sect and left this place. He continued until he was 50 kilometers away and found the scavenger campsite closest to the Diamond Sect.Compared to the Diamond Sect, which was 50 kilometers away, the campsite was clearly much livelier. Xu Qing could hear the commotion from afar.When he was about to get close, he suddenly thought of something and took out the leather coat he used to wear from his storage bag. He then picked up some soil and smeared it on his face. The vigilance in his eyes and his attire caused him to instantly become a scavenger.After checking and confirming that there was nothing wrong, Xu Qing crouched down and moved forward. He gradually arrived outside the scavenger campsite. As he got closer, the commotion became even more intense. Although there were guards here, they only glanced at Xu Qing and didn't care, allowing him to enter.Xu Qing's disguise as a scavenger couldn't be described as similar. He was originally a scavenger.He had the same aura, the same gaze, and the same cruelty.When he entered the scavenger campsite, Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the surrounding tents and looked into the distance. Over a hundred scavengers were gathered there and all of them were shouting excitedly. The commotion he heard earlier came from this group of people.What they were surrounding in excitement was a cruel scene.It was a competition.Like a dog race, seven to eight skinny figures in ragged clothes were running with all their might. The bodies of these seven to eight people were greenish-black due to the dense anomalous substances in their bodies, and they were not far from mutation.Their eyes were filled with despair and madness. As for the racing track they were running on, it was a path filled with sharp pebbles and blade fragments.The intense pain and blood from stepping on them could make one go crazy.At the end of the racetrack was a white pill covered in spots.To people with such a serious mutation, one white pill might not be able to save their lives but it could at least prolong their normal lives for some time. This time might give them a chance to obtain other white pills.Hence, even though they were running on such a treacherous track and the ground was covered in blood and all of them were trembling, their desire to survive still made them race crazily. This was a dog race as well as a horse race.Waves of excited and cruel shouts rang out from the scavengers in the surroundings. There was clearly betting involved.Xu Qing watched all of this. Finally, one of the runners dragged his bloody body to the end. After he snatched the white pill and swallowed it, the remaining participants fell into despair. They were then dragged to the starting point and a new white pill was placed back on the goal. The competition continued.As for the scavengers in the surroundings, some were happy, while others cursed non-stop. However, very soon, as the competition started again, they placed their bets one after another.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and looked in the direction of the Diamond Sect.At the same time, in the Diamond Sect's main hall on the mountaintop 50 kilometers away from the campsite, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was sitting there with an ugly expression. With some anger, he waved away the sect master who wanted to say something but hesitated."Do you really think this old man was willing to come to this godforsaken place? But what could we do if we didn't migrate here?!""That b*tch from the Seventh Peak is too vicious. I had to take out more than half of my life savings as an apology to her!!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor had a look of grief and indignation as he sat there and muttered."There's also that kid. He has gained a foothold in the Seven Blood Eyes. If we didn't migrate, should I have waited for him to slap me to death after he reaches the Foundation Building realm?!""According to this old man's countless experiences from reading ancient books, this matter is my life-and-death calamity…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor felt even more grief and indignation. When he thought of how the Diamond Sect had been reduced to such a miserable state in such a short period, his heart couldn't help but ache.The impact of the migration was huge. After all, not everyone was willing to migrate. During this period, there were many disciples who secretly escaped. Although he killed some, he couldn't kill them all."It's fine. My alchemy pill is about to be completed. As long as I swallow this pill, I'll finally be able to break through my 30th magic aperture and form my first ball of life fire. Once my life fire is formed, I'll be able to activate the Mystic Brilliance form of Foundation Building!"Under the Mystic Brilliance form, my combat strength will instantly increase greatly. At that time, I won't have to be afraid of that kid…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor gritted his teeth. However, when he thought of this, his expression suddenly changed."That's not right. According to the ancient books I've read, accidents often happen at such critical moments…" At the thought of this, the expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor changed drastically. It was only when he took out a token and held it in his hand that he heaved a sigh of relief."It's impossible for the kid to make a breakthrough so quickly. Besides, I've joined the Litu Sect now and can be considered a follower. The Litu Sect is also a giant like the Seven Blood Eyes. With this backer, I should be safe for the time being. Besides, Fellow Daoist Tu Yun was also invited by me and is still a guest in the sect…"The Diamond Sect's ancestor muttered. As he looked at the token, bitterness rose in his heart. For this token, he had paid a huge price. It could be considered as selling his body and he could not forsake it for the rest of his life.At the same time, he was worried about the danger. Basically, after he moved over, he had been inviting his friends over as guests every few days. Every time he invited someone over, he would give them gifts.So far, regardless of whether he was familiar with them or not, he had invited almost everyone he knew."One wrong step and every step will be wrong…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor let out a long sigh and looked at the distant sky, slowly feeling a little dazed.At that moment, the sunlight landed on his body. From afar, he looked old and weak.

Chapter 169 What Is Destined Cannot Be Avoided
Xu Qing naturally couldn't see the emotions nor hear the sighs of the Diamond Sect's ancestor.Xu Qing bought a residence in the scavenger campsite with great familiarity for his temporary rest.Although the scavenger campsite had a certain requirement for the residency rights of outsiders, if one had considerable strength, the rules could be bent.After Xu Qing dispersed his spirit energy at the third level of Qi Condensation, he bought a wooden hut. At the same time, due to the display of his purchasing ability, he attracted two scavengers with ill intentions.Their heads were quickly hung by Xu Qing at the gate.Just like that, everyone in the scavenger campsite accepted Xu Qing's arrival. Although there were people paying attention to him at the start, as the days passed, Xu Qing's performance was no different from that of a scavenger.Whether it was killing, going out to do missions, buying white pills, or even walking in the campsite with instinctive vigilance that was carved in his soul, all proved that he was a true scavenger.Gradually, no one paid too much attention to an outsider like him. After all, there were many unfamiliar scavengers in the wilderness. There would always be people who stayed outside for too long and wanted to find a residence to recuperate.In this kind of concealment, Xu Qing would head out to the vicinity of the Diamond Sect to observe every day. During this period, he also saw some Diamond Sect disciples who came down from the mountain to the scavenger campsite to have fun.Their appearance caused the scavengers to be angry but they didn't dare to speak up. Most of them revealed fawning expressions.Among them, Xu Qing found a few of the disciples a little familiar.He should have seen them when he went to set the fire.Although all of them had arrogant expressions when they entered the scavenger campsite, the worry and helplessness hidden in their hearts were still sensed by Xu Qing through their eyes.As time passed, Xu Qing gradually found more information about the Diamond Sect. As a sect that had relocated not long ago, their every move was observed by the scavengers.Hence, in half a month, Xu Qing already had a lot of understanding of the Diamond Sect's recent situation."There are less than a hundred people left in the sect.""Four of the seven elders left. Other than the three elders, there's also the sect master, so there are four experts under the Diamond Sect's ancestor now.""They have attached themselves to the Litu Sect and receive their protection…"Xu Qing sat down in his residence and analyzed the information he had obtained in the past half a month. He was very patient, especially when the opponent was a Foundation Building expert. Even though he felt that he could defeat him with his current combat strength, he had never fought a Foundation Building cultivator before.Hence, Xu Qing remained cautious. Even though he had analyzed these clues, he still didn't make a move. Instead, he continued to wait. Half a month later, he inadvertently found out a piece of news from the conversation between the two Diamond Sect disciples."The ancestor is really making a mountain out of a molehill… Every time a person he invited comes, he'll make us descend the mountain every few days and pretend to unintentionally spread some information about the sect to the surrounding scavenger campsites. Why bother?""That's right. It's been half a year but I haven't seen the kid taking the bait. Sigh, the ancestor frequently invites friends, another one usually comes a few days after one leaves, so we have to keep leaving the sect frequently to spread the news.""There's no choice… Who dares to disobey the ancestor's orders?"Xu Qing had secretly followed the two Diamond Sect disciples. When they were about to ascend the mountain, he heard this conversation. After hearing this, Xu Qing calmly returned to the campsite. In the next few days, he became even more cautious and his observation became more meticulous.It was only after he stayed in this scavenger campsite for a month and a half that Xu Qing, who was secretly investigating the vicinity of the Diamond Sect at dusk on this day, saw a ray of light stepping into the air and leaving.Vaguely, there seemed to be someone sending the person off at the top of the mountain.Xu Qing's gaze narrowed slightly as he retracted the sharpness in his eyes. He then turned and returned to his residence in the campsite. He began to organize his weapons and poison powder. After that, he looked at the sky outside and waited silently.At the same time, outside the main hall at the top of the mountain, the Diamond Sect's ancestor looked at the departing fellow daoist and sighed in his heart. After all, it wasn't good for him to keep them here for a long time. When he walked back to the main hall, he began to think about who he should invite next."It won't be long before the pill takes shape. After I eat it, I'll break through my 30th magic aperture and form the first ball of life fire. I'll then be able to activate the Mystic Brilliance Form. Only then will I be able to heave a sigh of relief."As he muttered, the Diamond Sect's ancestor disappeared into the main hall.The sky outside gradually darkened. The cold wind whistled and swept past the scavenger campsite, growing larger and larger.Due to the cold weather, the dust on the ground was frozen hard and couldn't be lifted. Only some trash moved in the wind. At the same time, the cold wind landed on some children who were hiding in the campsite.It was as though they had transformed into sharp blades that wanted to slash everything weak.Not long later, snowflakes also fell from the sky, not to be outdone. They scattered across the entire Red Plains and filled the land. Tonight, the snow was very heavy.The snowflakes soon covered the ground layer by layer, causing the people in the scavenger campsite who didn't have houses and could only sleep outside to shiver intensely. Their eyes were filled with death and numbness. please visit n0ve1bin)(.)n(e)t  This winter seemed colder than before and would freeze even more people to death.In the wind and snow, Xu Qing, who had organized everything, walked out of the wooden hut.He looked at the snow in the sky and felt the cold. He tightened his clothes and swept his gaze across the shivering children in the campsite. He was silent for a moment before he continued to walk, but he didn't close the door.There was still the lingering warmth of the fire inside the hut. The contrast with the temperature outside caused white fog to spread, attracting the attention of the nearby children. Their expressionless eyes showed hope at this instance.Xu Qing walked further and further away, faster and faster. In the end, his entire person seemed to have fused into the wind, transforming into an afterimage as he continued to approach the Diamond Sect's territory.The blood and qi in his body were boiling and his Sea Transformation Art was circulating. Purple light flowed throughout his body and gathered above his head, faintly forming a faint shadow of the heavenly saber.When he reached near, Xu Qing lifted his head and glanced at the Diamond Sect in the heavy snow.The moonlight was torn apart by the snow and should have formed mottled spots that scattered onto the Diamond Sect. However, the surrounding snow refracted the moonlight as though it was pieced together again. This caused the sect to be visible clearly.The clear image of the sect entered Xu Qing's eyes and transformed into killing intent and sharpness. At the next instant, Xu Qing suddenly flew up!The flight talisman on his leg flickered as his figure shot into the sky like a saber beam, breaking through the wind and snow toward the main hall on the mountain peak. His speed continued to rise till he arrived in the air above the main hall.Without any hesitation, he raised his right hand and slashed at the main hall on the mountain peak.The instant he slashed down, the world behind him rumbled and the shadow of a huge heavenly saber appeared in the sky. Although the wind and snow were strong, they couldn't shake the heavenly saber at all. Following Xu Qing's hand gesture, the heavenly saber slashed through the wind and snow, falling toward the main hall on the mountain peak.The heavenly saber that was hundreds of feet long emitted even more violent aura when it slashed. It was as though everything that existed in front of it would be cut into two.Its speed was so fast that it landed on the main hall in the blink of an eye. A loud explosive sound rang out and the entire mountain trembled. The main hall collapsed under the saber light and shattered from the middle, directly splitting into two. In the shattered gap, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who was retreating after resisting the saber strike, was revealed.He saw Xu Qing but before he could speak, Xu Qing, who was standing in the air, slashed down a second time!The increase in his cultivation allowed Xu Qing to use this saber strike he had comprehended from the temple many times. This was especially so since he had long accumulated strength on the way here. At this moment, he didn't stop at all. The second heavenly saber shadow manifested behind him and landed on the Diamond Sect's ancestor again.An earth-shattering explosion rang out as the purple heavenly saber descended again. Under the deep shout of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, it directly collided with him again.The main hall on the mountaintop completely collapsed. The Diamond Sect's ancestor roared as he resisted the second saber strike. The qi and blood in his body also churned and his body suddenly retreated by 1000 feet. With a wave of his hand, the angry guardian warrior shadow under him appeared and his aura rose.However, his hair was disheveled and there was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth. Clearly, Xu Qing's two slashes had not been easy to fend off!"Fellow Daoist, you…" Although the Diamond Sect's ancestor had already made a guess, he still couldn't believe the strength of the person in front of him. Hence, he quickly spoke up, trying to confirm his guess.However, before he could finish speaking, his expression changed drastically. He retreated with all his might but it was still a little too late. No one on the ground noticed that the shadow that was hidden in the night had already rapidly approached under Xu Qing's control. In the blink of an eye, it landed on the Diamond Sect's ancestor and was about to shrink.Although the Diamond Sect's ancestor reacted extremely quickly and dodged, his arm was still touched. In an instant, the anomalous substances on his arm became dense and turned greenish-black. This caused him to be extremely shocked.At the same time, Xu Qing, who was in the air, looked coldly at the Diamond Sect's ancestor. He didn't say anything and slashed down the third strike he had accumulated.In an instant, purple light overflowed into the sky and the saber shadow formed, cutting through the wind and snow in all directions. It landed again on the Diamond Sect's ancestor who was retreating from the shadowThe guardian warrior shadow let out a roar and raised its hands to block the saber strike. With a loud collision, the arms of the shadow collapsed. Blood flowed out of the corner of the Diamond Sect's ancestor's mouth and his body was continuously blasted back.However, as a Foundation Building cultivator, even if he didn't advance through a powerful cultivation art, Foundation Building was still Foundation Building. His combat strength was still extremely strong. After suffering three saber strikes and the shadow's sneak attack, he was only injured. As he continuously retreated, he suddenly lifted his head and his eyes were bloodshot as he spoke through gritted teeth."You're the kid!"The disciples of the Diamond Sect were all shocked. The sect master, elders, and the others all rushed out. All of their expressions changed drastically as they looked at the sky.In the sky, Xu Qing's long hair fluttered, and his scavenger attire added to his killing intent. Under the moonlight and in the wind and snow, he looked like the Hades, in charge of life and death.

Chapter 170 Eternal Damnation
Xu Qing didn't speak.He didn't have the habit of chatting too much during a battle. Almost at the instant the Diamond Sect's ancestor retreated, the flight talisman on his leg suddenly shone.At the next instant, his figure was like a rainbow as he tore through the air and rushed toward the Diamond Sect's ancestor. He instantly got close. As he got close, the Ba shadow behind him manifested.Its sinister appearance was so chapped that it seemed to contain magma. The instant it appeared, heat spread in all directions, causing the snowflakes in a large area to melt into rain and fog.His qi and blood were stimulated to the extreme. He circulated the Mountains and Seas Art with all his might, causing his body refinement technique to be maintained at its peak at this moment. He arrived in front of the Diamond Sect's ancestor and punched ruthlessly.Killing intent flashed in the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor. With a wave of his hand, the guardian warrior shadow under him roared at the sky and punched back.This confrontation between the two sides that didn't hold anything back caused a booming explosion to ring in all directions. Xu Qing was pushed back and blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.In terms of pure body refinement, he was still inferior to the Diamond Sect's ancestor's Foundation Building body.However, the Diamond Sect's ancestor didn't feel good either. The qi and blood in his body churned and he similarly retreated. His expression was ferocious but it hid deep horror. He had completely recognized Xu Qing but the more he recognized him, the more intense the shock in his heart.Although he had guessed that the kid would become stronger quickly, he still didn't expect that in less than a year, the other party had gone from being chased by him to attacking his sect.Moreover, the changes in his strength before and after were too great."You…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor's breathing was hurried. He wanted to say something but what awaited him was the cruelty in Xu Qing's eyes as he suddenly rushed over.Booming sounds erupted once again. Xu Qing's attacks were too fast and he didn't slow down or pause at all. When he got close, he punched out again and again. In fact, it was the same for his legs. They would occasionally sweep out and his forehead was also his weapon which he used to slam the ancestor if he was close enough.. The vicious attacks did not give the Diamond Sect's ancestor time to take a breath. He was suppressed and was being pushed back. This increased his shock even more. The guardian warrior shadow under him even showed signs of collapse."You're courting death!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor let out a low roar and quickly performed a series of hand seals with both hands. Immediately, the magic aperture in his body circulated and the aura of a Foundation Building cultivator rose again, forming a pressure that suppressed Xu Qing. As he performed a series of hand seals, a dazzling golden light appeared behind him.This golden light transformed into a whip that lashed out fiercely at Xu Qing. Even the space seemed to explode at the touch of this whip.The Ba shadow behind Xu Qing roared and emitted a large amount of fiery aura. When it came into contact with the whip, an astonishing sound rang out. Although the Ba shadow didn't collapse when it came into contact with the whip and even grabbed it, the impact formed by the Foundation Building magic power still caused Xu Qing's entire body to tremble and he spat out a mouthful of blood.His body flew back and fell toward the sect gate.The eyes of the sect master and the three elders revealed killing intent. The other disciples were the same. Their gazes were filled with hatred as they all rushed in the direction Xu Qing had fallen and quickly attacked."Die!" The eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor in the air were also red and filled with killing intent. He quickly performed a series of hand seals with both hands.Another Foundation Building spell formed. It was a huge Daoist seal that manifested in the sky.It was a few hundred feet in size and the wind and snow moved away from it on their own. It carried an astonishing aura as it pressed down on the falling Xu Qing!The commotion was so great that even the Diamond Sect's sect gate trembled. The surrounding snowflakes shattered into powder and scattered in all directions.A cold glint flashed in the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor. His hands formed a seal and he waved them out. In an instant, two phantoms that were similar to the guardian warrior beneath him appeared around him and punched out at the same time.Three guardian warrior shadows punched toward Xu Qing from three directions.If it was any other Qi Condensation cultivator, even if they were at the great circle of perfection, they wouldn't be able to withstand all of this. Foundation Building spells themselves possessed powerful strength, and the magic apertures also had a powerful effect.To a certain extent, this was equivalent to seven to eight talismans being used at the same time.Just as the attacks of the Diamond Sect disciples, the punches of the three guardian warrior shadows, and the large seal above were about to land on the falling Xu Qing, a cold glint flashed in his eyes.He performed a series of hand seals with both hands and an astonishing spirit energy fluctuation erupted from his body. This fluctuation continued to expand outwards and in the blink of an eye, it reached nearly a thousand feet and transformed into a spirit sea!It suddenly exploded outwards with an astonishing aura. As it exploded, it directly formed a terrifying force that swept in all directions.The cultivation levels of the Sect Master, elders, and disciples below were no different under Xu Qing's spirit energy bombardment. In an instant, their bodies trembled violently and they collapsed in unison!Wherever the spirit energy force swept by, mountains rumbled and buildings shattered. Everyone… was destroyed in body and spirit!As for the spell cast by the Diamond Sect's ancestor, under the eruption of the spirit sea, rumbling sounds filled the sky.The three guardian warrior shadows instantly blurred, like afterimages flowing through the wind, dissipating quickly. It was the same for the large seal in the sky. As it landed, it seemed to have encountered a violent wind and gradually disappeared.The expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor changed drastically. He had retreated far away but he was still affected. Fresh blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth again and the injuries in his body worsened. At the same time, his left arm was covered by the shadow again.Although he barely dodged it, his entire left arm was greenish-black and the anomalous substances that invaded it were extremely dense. There was also a black iron stick that whistled over and directly pierced through his right shoulder.Other than that, what caused his heart to tremble even more at this moment was that he sensed that his blood and qi were unstable and signs of poisoning appeared in his body. His expression turned extremely gloomy. He quickly took out a medicinal pill and swallowed it. He immediately retreated further away.However, his gaze was fixed on Xu Qing, who had landed in the shattered Diamond Sect, revealing intense killing intent. "The spirit sea formed by the Seventh Peak's Sea Transformation Art can indeed shake a Foundation Building cultivator when it erupts in one go. However, it can only be done once. You're dead meat now!"Xu Qing's breathing was hurried. There was a talisman shining outside his body, but he still spat out a large mouthful of blood. However, there was no surprise on his face. He was already very clear about how powerful Foundation Building cultivators were when he arrived.And, he still felt that he could kill him!Hence, the moment he attacked, he used his strongest killing move. Regardless of whether it was the heavenly saber, shadow, or Ba Shadow, even the spirit sea in his body, he used all of them ruthlessly.This was especially so for poison. From the moment he attacked until now, he had used a total of 73 types!At this moment, everything was in line with his plan. Hence, the instant the Diamond Sect's ancestor's expression turned cold, Xu Qing lifted his right hand and grabbed fiercely at the Diamond Sect's ancestor who was retreating in the sky.The eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor suddenly narrowed. The countless snowflakes in his surroundings suddenly turned into water droplets.At a glance, the range of these water droplets had reached a thousand feet."You! Why do you still have spirit energy!!!" The instant the Diamond Sect's ancestor lost his voice in horror, the water droplets in an area of 1,000 feet rapidly fused and directly transformed into a large hand that grabbed fiercely at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor spat out a mouthful of blood and his body retreated rapidly. While great waves were churning in his heart, the thousand-foot-long hand formed by the water droplets changed their form and transformed again… into the appearance of a plesiosaur! please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This was none other than Xu Qing's Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale. It roared at the sky and ruthlessly bit at the Diamond Sect's ancestor!The expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor completely changed as he cried out involuntarily."Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale!"He had some understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes and knew that after cultivating the Seventh Peak's Sea Transformation Art to the eighth level, some outstanding people could form the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale. The dragonwhale was equivalent to the cultivator's second vessel that stored spirit energy!However, such people were rare!He had also seen Forbidden Sea Dragonwhales before. However, although the aura of Xu Qing's dragonwhale was the same, regardless of its appearance or the power of the Forbidden Sea contained in it, it gave him a completely different feeling.Amidst his drastic change in expression, the Diamond Sect's ancestor retreated once again. He didn't want to fight anymore. The anomalous substances in his body were now dense and he was unable to neutralize the poison in his body immediately. Moreover, the poison outbreak was becoming more severe, causing his internal organs to feel a piercing pain. When he spat out blood, it carried a black stench, as though his internal organs were corroding and melting."If I can activate the Mystic Brilliance Form…"The Diamond Sect's ancestor let out a low roar in his heart, filled with unwillingness and helplessness. As for the bizarre shadow hidden in the surroundings, they caused his heart to skip a beat. If he wasn't careful, the amount of anomalous substances would increase again after coming into contact with them.This was especially so when just the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale and Xu Qing's body refinement power were enough to make him feel an intense life-and-death crisis."I'm a follower of the Litu Sect. I…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor shouted. However, before he could finish speaking, the flight talisman on Xu Qing's body flickered. Once in the air, Xu Qing calmly spoke."It's about time."This was the first thing he said since the battle began.Before the Diamond Sect's ancestor could react, Xu Qing waved his hand coldly. Immediately… his magic boat rumbled out!The boat that was hundreds of feet tall had a sinister appearance like the black tortoise. There were also sails that were like wings, causing the magic boat that appeared in the air to reveal indescribable cruelty.As the golden light on the ship flashed and gathered on the sharp spike at the bow, a divine intent actually erupted from the magic boat and locked onto the Diamond Sect's ancestor.This divine intent was like a god, causing the wind and snow in the surroundings to instantly dissipate.An astonishing pressure descended.As for Xu Qing, who was standing on the magic boat, he was like the ruler who controlled the god. He looked coldly at the Diamond Sect's ancestor and lifted his right hand. As he lifted his hand, the convergence of divinity became increasingly intense. Clearly, as long as he put down his hand, the divine power attack would erupt.Divine attack. This was his magic boat's strongest move. Originally, Xu Qing planned to use it immediately, but he was worried that he wouldn't be able to kill a Foundation Building cultivator who was at his peak and uninjured with a single strike.That was why he personally took action and waited until now. He finally felt that the time was ripe and took it out to ensure that he could kill in one strike!The expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor was unprecedentedly pale. His scalp felt like it was about to explode and his eyes revealed extreme disbelief as he cried out involuntarily."Divinity!!"The bitterness in the Sect's ancestor's heart also churned endlessly, transforming into horror. At this moment, the life-and-death crisis had already become infinitely intense… Every part of his flesh and blood seemed to be trembling and screaming under the power of divinity, constantly reminding him of the arrival of death."I can't escape. If I was in my peak state, I might have a chance. Now…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor was in despair. He looked at Xu Qing, who was standing on the magic boat, and recalled the ancient books he had read before. He hurriedly shouted."Fellow Daoist, wait a moment. Listen to me. I'm willing to be your slave. I'm willing to be your slave for the rest of my life. You will be my master. I…"Xu Qing's expression was cold and he didn't bother with it. He didn't have the hobby of taking in slaves. He suddenly lowered his right hand!
