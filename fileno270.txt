Ding Xue immediately took out a jade slip and looked at Xu Qing.The moment Xu Qing gave the signal, she would transmit her voice to ask for help.Xu Qing listened attentively. After waiting for a long time, the exact same voice from before appeared a second time."Father, hurry up and go home…"The voice was still filled with deep longing that could be felt by others. It seemed to come from the secret passage but it gave people the feeling that it was coming from right beside their ears. They could easily imagine the scene in front of them.Xu Qing was silent. He didn't sense any dangerous fluctuations in the secret passage and similarly didn't sense any coldness of the bizarre entity. However, he still instantly ignited his life fire and activated the Mystic Brilliance Form.In the past month, this was the first time Xu Qing had activated his Mystic Brilliance Form in front of Ding Xue. The dangers he had encountered previously could be resolved by his ordinary form.As his auras erupted, Ding Xue and Zhao Zhongheng both took a deep breath and instinctively retreated a little. Their eyes instantly stung and they didn't dare to look straight at him.Ding Xue was still fine. Although she couldn't open her eyes, the surprise in her heart was more than shock. However, Zhao Zhongheng's expression changed. The construction in his heart almost collapsed again.'Who said that the one standing in the light is the hero? My sincerity is different from the others!' Zhao Zhongheng's breathing was hurried as he encouraged himself.Xu Qing didn't know what Ding Xue and Zhao Zhongheng were thinking at this moment, and he didn't care. Now that the Mystic Brilliance Form had been activated, he didn't hesitate at all. He rushed into the secret passage.Xu Qing moved extremely fast. Wherever he passed, there would be popping sounds and a series of echoes in the narrow secret passage.At the same time, he also sensed that the corpse poison in this place was indeed rapidly dissipating, as though it was evaporating after death.Xu Qing arrived at the end of the secret passage. His gaze was like lightning as he rapidly observed his surroundings. This place was like a simple hiding place.There was a figure of the Sea Corpse Race in the corner. He looked like a human old man and was already dead.There were several shocking wounds on the corpse, especially the location of the dantian, which was badly mangled. The injuries there were the most fatal and almost penetrated his body. This corpse was the source of the anomalous substances and corpse poison.Even though he was dead, the lingering power emitted by his body was still very strong. Xu Qing swept his gaze over and judged that this person at least had a ball of life fire when he was alive.This Sea Corpse Race member had clearly suffered serious injuries from the extermination of his vitality on the merfolk island. He insisted on hiding here and was no longer able to escape or recover. In the end, he died silently.He shouldn't have died long ago. That was why the anomalous substances spread out when the secret passage was opened.His expression was also a little different from the Sea Corpse Race cultivators Xu Qing had seen. Although his face was gradually rotting, one could still faintly see the confusion he had when he was alive. He was holding a small bronze bottle tightly in his hand.It was as though this was his most precious item before he died.This small bottle was very old and had already been opened. The voice Xu Qing had heard earlier rang out from it."Father, hurry up and go home…"The voice was very weak and filled with longing.As for the old man from the Sea Corpse Race, he seemed to have opened the bottle before he died. As he gradually entered the embrace of death, he kept listening to this voice over and over again.This voice probably belonged to his closest kin.Xu Qing's gaze swept past the bottle and observed his surroundings. Just as he confirmed that there was no danger here, footsteps rang out from behind him.The people who came were Zhao Zhongheng and Ding Xue. After Xu Qing entered the secret passage, they waited for a while and sensed that there was no movement inside. Hence, Ding Xue was anxious and quickly ran in. Zhao Zhongheng could only follow.Upon noticing that Xu Qing was fine, Ding Xue heaved a sigh of relief. Only then did she observe her surroundings. After seeing everything clearly, she looked at the bottle in the hand of the corpse and exclaimed."Sound-catching bottle!"Ding Xue, who had an astonishing background, clearly had knowledge that exceeded that of ordinary cultivators. She recognized the origin of the bronze bottle at a glance. Hence, after noticing Xu Qing's gaze sweeping over, she hurriedly informed him."The sound-catching bottle is an ancient item and is very rare. Its value is priceless to some people but worthless to many. This is because its function is very simple. It captures sound. After covering it, you can open it at any time and hear the captured sound.""The sound is extremely real. It can even be said to be the original sound. This is its queerness and preciousness but it can't last permanently. After opening for a long time, the sound will slowly dissipate and needs to be captured again." Best novel online free at ⓝ0ⓥⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Ding Xue looked at the Sea Corpse Race member and then at the sound-catching bottle that he held tightly in his hand as though it was a treasure. She seemed to understand something."The Sea Corpse Race consists of members of various races who were revived in a unique way after they died. Once they become a member of the Sea Corpse Race, they can only retain some memories of when they were alive.""However, this memory is useless because the nature of the Sea Corpse Race is cruel. The moment they revive, it's equivalent to severing ties with their previous lives. Very few people keep the things they were fond of when they were alive.""If this bottle is his, then this Sea Corpse Race cultivator is really abnormal. He actually retained the thing he had when he was alive. This bottle should be something he misses and an obsession.""As for the voice in the bottle, maybe it was of his child? But no matter how he was when he was alive, he is now a member of the Sea Corpse Race."Ding Xue's tone was filled with uncertainty. Clearly, she wasn't too sure if the truth was as she had judged.

Chapter 242 The Ancestor Is Panicked (2)
"It's not important anymore." Xu Qing shook his head. He then lifted his right hand and grabbed. Immediately, the small bronze bottle flew into his hand.The voice in the bottle had completely weakened. After it appeared once more, it completely disappeared.Ding Xue glanced at Zhao Zhongheng. If it was anyone else, it would be very difficult to see the meaning of this glance. However, Zhao Zhongheng understood tacitly and immediately went forward to search the body of the Sea Corpse Race without any hesitation.Very soon, they found a storage bag and the three of them left the secret passage.Xu Qing covered the sound-catching bottle and kept it.Ding Xue told the sect what she had discovered here and could be considered to have completed her mission. As for the items in the storage bag, there weren't many. Most of them were miscellaneous items. There were no magic artifacts or jade talismans. Clearly, they had all been used up.There were a few hundred spirit stones and three to five spirit tickets. They didn't know if it was because he was poor to begin with or if he hid his items in another place.Xu Qing swept his gaze over. He took the sound-catching bottle and didn't ask for anything else.Xu Qing didn't know what use this bottle would have in the future but this item itself was very strange. Xu Qing felt that it had some value.Zhao Zhongheng and Ding Xue were both rich people and didn't fancy the things in the storage bag. However, they still shared them. After all, it was more or less a gain.Just like that, as Ding Xue reported the matter of the secret passage, this matter came to an end. Next, the other disciples of the sect would deal with the follow-up matters. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Time quickly passed. While Ding Xue was becoming increasingly depressed because of Zhao Zhongheng's appearance, the one-month deadline was up. As Xu Qing bade farewell and left, Ding Xue felt extremely regretful and chased after him to show her concern."Senior Brother Xu, the frontline is dangerous, you have to be careful. Your safety is the most important.""My cultivation level is low and I don't have anything to show. However, I'll ask my aunt to take care of you more. If you encounter anything that can't be resolved, you can look for her directly.""Also, Senior Brother Xu, thank you for your help during this time. I'll definitely work harder to learn about plants and vegetation and strive to join the Seven Sects Alliance as soon as possible. At that time, I'll be able to help Senior Brother in plants and vegetation."Ding Xue's expression was serious. After that, she casually spoke."As for the Dao of plants and vegetation of the Second Peak, it's a little inferior. I'll definitely be more proficient than the disciples of the Second Peak in the future.""Thank you. You should take good care of yourself too. All the best." Xu Qing sighed with emotion. He could hear the sincerity in Ding Xue's words. In his heart, he felt that although Ding Xue had some plans in the past month, she was a good person. Moreover, she was very diligent and eager to learn. Xu Qing approved of this point.As for her saying that the Second Peak's Dao of plants and vegetation was inferior, Xu Qing didn't have much contact with the Second Peak and couldn't comment. He cupped his fists at Ding Xue and turned to leave.Ding Xue reluctantly watched as Xu Qing's back disappeared from her sight. She turned her head and ruthlessly glared at Zhao Zhongheng. She let out a cold snort and chose to leave the merfolk islands.She was very clear that the frontline was dangerous and it was not suitable for her to continue staying here with her cultivation base.As for Zhao Zhongheng, he looked at Ding Xue's graceful back view with an incomparably firm gaze. He felt that his judgment was correct.'Cultivation isn't important in this matter. My sincerity can surpass everything! That Xu Qing's cultivation is indeed stronger than mine but he left just like that. However, I'm not like this. I'll always accompany my senior sister.'At the thought of this, Zhao Zhongheng took a deep breath and hurriedly followed. Under Ding Xue's annoyance, they left together.As for Xu Qing, he didn't leave the merfolk islands.After completing the mission to protect Ding Xue, he not only obtained three disorder teleportation talismans but also a decree given by the deputy peak lord. With this decree, he could retreat from the war without applying a request. It could even be done during missions.It was the same as having the right to return to the sect at any time. His obligation to participate in the battle was still there, but it had been changed from the front line to the back.His battle results and the subsequent rewards of the war wouldn't be reduced.This allowed him to have very strong autonomy.Even a Golden Core elder would find it very difficult to issue such a decree. Only the higher-ups at the peak lord level had the qualifications, so its value was extremely high. Xu Qing was aware that the deputy peak lord had given it to him because of Ding Xue."This is a favor. I will need to repay Ding Xue in the future." Xu Qing remembered this matter and took out his identity token to check the missions inside.He didn't plan to leave immediately. Although he had spent a month on Ding Xue's Dao Protector mission and his ranking in the war had fallen back to below 70, Xu Qing felt that it wouldn't be very difficult to increase it.He wanted to enter the top 50 and obtain the right to use the magic treasure projection once.In the following period of time, Xu Qing once again immersed himself in the missions. Every day, he would be busy with one mission after another, killing the Sea Corpse Race and refining the Sea Corpse souls. Occasionally, he would even farm battle results with the shadow.Gradually, his ranking neared 50 and he wasn't far from obtaining the chance to use the magic treasure's projection. On this day… Xu Qing, who had just handed in the mission, was about to accept the next mission when his expression suddenly changed. He lowered his head and looked at his feet.His eyes gleamed with a strange light as he disappeared from his original location. After he arrived at a remote corner, Xu Qing calmly spoke."What do you want to say?" Just now, the shadow had transmitted some emotions to him."Advancement… Quiet… Safety… Breakthrough…" The shadow tried its best to express itself.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed.In this war with the Sea Corpse Race, the shadow had provided a lot of help. Now that it had devoured so many Sea Corpse Race members, it was finally about to break through. This filled Xu Qing with anticipation.After he formed his life fire, the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor clearly couldn't keep up with him. However, Xu Qing was still vigilant against the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor, especially the former.As the shadow transmitted the information that it was about to break through, the black iron stick at the side trembled slightly. The Diamond Sect's ancestor inside also quickly transmitted his divine sense."Master, I was about to report to you that I… can break through too. I also need a quiet and safe environment because… the artifact spirit technique I cultivate is different from other random things. It will attract heavenly lightning to cleanse my soul!!""Once I break through, I can erupt with combat strength similar to the Mystic Brilliance Form!"The Diamond Sect's ancestor's words revealed determination, but his heart was filled with anxiety.In reality, he was still a little short of breaking through. However, he couldn't wait anymore. He felt that once the shadow broke through first, if he still maintained his current state, losing his status was secondary. What was important was that he might be considered useless.Once he was considered useless, he felt that there was a high chance that he would be thrown out as cannon fodder at some point…Hence, he was prepared to give it a try.Xu Qing glanced at the black iron stick and then at the shadow. He had already made a decision.

Chapter 243 Battle Of Status!
Top 50 in the war score of Seven Blood Eyes could obtain the qualifications to use the projection of the sect's magic treasure once.Xu Qing was tempted by this.On one hand, he had never seen a magic treasure but he had heard too many things about the strength of magic treasures.After all, even in the entire Seven Blood Eyes, there was only one magic treasure.  Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ At the same time, Xu Qing was also curious about why magic treasures had such rumors. He wanted to know what the Seven Blood Eyes' magic treasure looked like and what kind of might it could unleash.These were what tempted him.However, Xu Qing felt that he couldn't delay the Diamond Sect's ancestor and the shadow's breakthrough because of curiosity.Xu Qing knew very well which one was more important.After all, no matter how strong the magic treasure projection was, he could only use it once. However, the advancement of the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor would increase his combat strength.Hence, Xu Qing didn't hesitate and immediately gave up on accepting the mission. He made use of the right to be exempted from the war given by Ding Xue's aunt and chose to leave while the Seven Blood Eyes continued to advance toward the Sea Corpse Race with an imposing aura."I have to find a safe and remote island so that the breakthrough of the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor won't be disturbed."This was especially so when the Diamond Sect's ancestor said that there would be lightning tribulation when he broke through. This made Xu Qing pay even more attention to the location.He made a prompt decision and used the teleportation array on the merfolk island to activate a long-distance teleportation in the opposite direction of the battlefield.This time, the place he teleported to was an island of nonhuman races called the Cape Sand Race.They were one of the Seven Blood Eyes' allies and most of them had gentle personalities. Because they were good at refining a material called the flickering sea and had extremely high attainments in puppet research, they had been protected by the Seven Blood Eyes for more than a hundred years.As for the members of the Cape Sand Race, they were very strange. Their appearances were similar to humans, but their bodies were only the size of a palm. Humans were like giants in front of them.Their clan's territory was also a small kingdom.However, in order to receive foreign friends, they built a large city not far from the teleportation array that could allow cultivators to stay.When Xu Qing appeared in the Cape Sand Race's teleportation array, it was already dusk.The afterglow of the setting sun scattered down in the distance, reflecting the purple color on the black surface of the sea. It contrasted with the fiery red glow in the sky and gave off a mysterious feeling.The harmony and peace here were quite rare in the Forbidden Sea. Since Xu Qing had been in the battlefield till now, there was still some baleful aura from the war on his body. He felt a little uncomfortable when he entered this peaceful place.Xu Qing lifted his head and looked into the distance. He saw countless members of the Cape Sand Race busying themselves in the small city in the distance. From time to time, singing could be heard and he could faintly see even smaller children playing with the sand.However, there were many auras of experts here.Even though the Cape Sand Race was extremely short, Xu Qing wouldn't underestimate them. This was because he had read about them in the Homicide Department's dossier. He knew that although the Cape Sand Race was gentle, their combat strength was astonishing, especially since they were good at Dao of puppets.Xu Qing, who had walked out of the teleportation array, swept his gaze across the surroundings and looked at the eight puppets sitting outside the teleportation array.Each of these eight puppets was the size of a human. Their bodies were made of iron and wood and their faces were pitch-black with gems as their eyes.There were no spirit energy fluctuations coming from their bodies, as though they were dead objects.The instant Xu Qing's gaze landed, the gem eyes of one of the puppets suddenly lit up. Cracking sounds echoed as it lifted its head and looked at Xu Qing. After that, it stood up and cupped its fists."Welcome to the Cape Sand Race. May I know why a distinguished guest from the Seven Blood Eyes is here?"Xu Qing carefully sized up this puppet. Even though the other party had spoken, he still didn't sense any spirit energy fluctuations.Xu Qing felt very strange. However, he knew that there were many things that he couldn't rashly inquire about. Hence, he spoke in a low voice."I'm passing by and want to go to the nearby sea area. Do you have a nautical chart for sale?""Since you're an esteemed guest from the Seven Blood Eyes, you don't need to buy it." The puppet waved its right hand and a grain of sand appeared in it. It threw it at Xu Qing.After Xu Qing caught it, his expression was a little moved. This small grain of sand actually recorded information like a jade slip. He only swept his magic power slightly and a very detailed nautical chart appeared in his mind.After thanking the puppet, Xu Qing took another look at the peaceful atmosphere of the race. With a sway of his body, he rose into the air and headed toward the distance.He was extremely fast, causing a booming sound. In an instant, he disappeared.After he left, the other seven puppets beside the teleportation array lifted their heads one after another and looked in the direction Xu Qing had left in."The Seven Blood Eyes is currently fighting against the Sea Corpse Race. This person's cultivation isn't ordinary and gives me a lot of pressure. Moreover, his body clearly contains the aura of the battlefield. Why is he here?""I also sensed his cultivation fluctuations. Although it's not very clear, to be able to make the magic power circulation of my magic aperture stagnate, this person should be at the mid-stage Foundation Building realm.""However, from his actions, he doesn't seem to have any ill intentions."These eight puppets didn't move at all and transmitted their voices to each other. After confirming that Xu Qing had indeed left, they slowly relaxed and lowered their heads again, not moving at all.Time flowed by and a night passed.The next morning, when the sunlight scattered down, burning the sea and sky, Xu Qing's figure appeared in the sky. His speed didn't decrease at all as he continued to speed forward.He didn't choose to move out on the magic ship. That would be too big of a target. He relied on his own strength to search the entire night. According to the descriptions on the nautical chart, he finally found an area that met the requirements.This was an abandoned mining island.The nautical chart described that the island was discovered to have a spirit vein a hundred years ago, so it attracted the attention of the Cape Sand. After mining it for 60 years and emptying it, it was abandoned. The spirit energy on it was scarce and the anomalous substances were dense. Although there were plants, most of them had some forms of offensive methods.Moreover, there was no longer any value inside or outside the island, so almost no one came here.There were many such islands on the Forbidden Sea.Xu Qing examined the island from the air. In the end, he decided to let the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor advance on this island. After making the decision, he headed straight for the island.Very soon, he landed on the island. Xu Qing waved his hand and scattered a cloud of poison powder, causing some of the plants in the surroundings that were twisting around him to instantly wither and die.Xu Qing didn't even glance at them and headed straight for the mines on the island. Not long later, he found one.This mineshaft was pitch-black. The morning sunlight outside was clearly bright, but the pitch-blackness here seemed to be impenetrable by light. It emitted dense anomalous substances and waves of cold air.The surroundings of the mineshaft were covered in a layer of black ice which seemed to be highly toxic as there was no vegetation in the surroundings.This place wasn't a suitable place for cultivation for any cultivator but Xu Qing's shadow was very satisfied.In fact, its figure under the sunlight couldn't help but extend a little toward the mineshaft.Xu Qing was also satisfied with it. After he got closer and confirmed that there was no danger, he broke off a piece of black ice on the ground.The cold air coming from the black ice was astonishing and the anomalous substances in it were extremely dense. Just by touching it, the anomalous substances in it invaded Xu Qing's body. However, at the next instant, they were rapidly absorbed by Xu Qing's shadow."This thing is a little interesting." Xu Qing squatted down and collected some of the black ice here. Unfortunately, it was very difficult to preserve this item. They would volatilize quickly after they were broken off.With regret, Xu Qing was about to step into the mineshaft."Master, be careful. You should not enter a strange place rashly. Let me clear the way." The Diamond Sect's ancestor quickly spoke and took the initiative to control the black iron stick. After it flew into the mineshaft, he transmitted his divine sense."Master, everything is normal down there."At the side, the shadow that was happily absorbing the black ice paused for a moment. It also hurriedly extended a section to the bottom of the deep pit and similarly emitted safety fluctuations.Xu Qing didn't care about the matter between the Diamond Sect's ancestor and the shadow. He was also happy to see them targeting each other. His expression was as calm as ever. He first set up some poison in the surroundings before stepping into the mineshaft.The anomalous substances in the mine were clearly denser and the cold air in it was oppressive. It was also pitch-black.Even though magic power gushed into his eyes, Xu Qing could only vaguely see a huge tunnel ahead with traces of mining.Xu Qing didn't hesitate to light the life lantern.In the blink of an eye, invisible flames spread out from his entire body, vaguely forming a black umbrella above his head to protect his soul.He instantly disappeared and began to investigate if there was any danger in the mineshaft.Although he had sensed that this place was safe earlier, Xu Qing would not be at ease till he inspected it. At that moment, under the Mystic Brilliance Form, his entire person was like flames, sweeping through the entire mineshaft.Even though there were many tunnels here, with Xu Qing's speed, he only used the time it takes for an incense stick to burn to finish examining them all.Other than some bats, this place was safe.After confirming this, Xu Qing sat down in the depths of the mineshaft and spoke softly in the darkness."Shadow, you can advance now."As Xu Qing's voice rang out, his shadow instantly spread out.Although there was still a trace of connection with Xu Qing, 99% of it spread into the distance and rotated rapidly there.Outsiders couldn't see this scene. Only Xu Qing could sense it. He could sense that as the shadow rotated rapidly, the anomalous substances in the surroundings gathered crazily and surged into the vortex.This vortex grew larger and deeper until all the anomalous substances in the mineshaft were absorbed. The vortex suddenly trembled and stopped spinning. Instead, it transformed into something like a deep pool.Its shape was circular and was a full 100 feet long.The shadow had melted and turned into a pool of black mucus. Bubbles kept popping up on the surface of the water as though the pool was boiling.Every time a bubble shattered, waves of soul-stirring roars would ring out, as though some evolution was unfolding inside.Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation but his vigilance didn't decrease. After all, the shadow had an untamed personality. It was hard to say if it would suddenly act foolishly after breaking through. Hence, he silently poured a portion of his magic power into the purple crystal and was prepared to suppress the shadow at any time.At the same time, the Diamond Sect's ancestor saw that the shadow had already begun and Demon Xu was clearly looking forward to it. He even seemed to be protecting him. This caused him to feel an extremely strong sense of danger and intense nervousness.'He's protecting it. Demon Xu clearly values the silly shadow more!''According to the logic in the book, once the silly shadow breaks through first, the pressure on me will definitely be extremely great. Moreover, even if I break through later, I'm still too slowâ¦''In the stories, the slower one is, the slower one will be until they are completely left behind. This won't do!' The Diamond Sect's ancestor's mind trembled. He definitely couldn't let such a thing happen.'For the sake of status, for the sake of not becoming cannon fodder, I have to break through before the silly shadow!!'At the thought of this, the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor turned slightly red. His voice was incomparably solemn and carried intense determination as he spoke in a low voice."Master, I want to advance!"

Chapter 244 Lightning Spirit Body
Xu Qing was surprised.He glanced at the Diamond Sect's ancestor and felt that the other party's sudden words were a little strange."Are you sure?" Xu Qing slowly spoke.He could sense that the aura of the Diamond Sect's ancestor was much stronger than before, as though it had reached a certain critical point, but it was still a little unstable. It didn't seem like it had reached the point of breakthrough."I'm extremely sure!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor quickly glanced at the shadow and spoke loudly.Xu Qing had never been an artifact spirit before and didn't know what its state of breakthrough was like, so he fell silent for a moment.Seeing Xu Qing pondering, the Diamond Sect's ancestor became nervous.He was worried that Xu Qing would reject him in order to do his best to take care of the shadow. At the same time, he recalled that there was a plot in one of the countless ancient books he had read.The plot described that after the protagonist rejected his pet once, he somehow fell in love with the feeling of rejecting the requests. Hence, he rejected everything from then on.In the end, he treated his pet as food.'Demon Xu cultivates Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art… Did he already plan to devour me one day?'Although the Diamond Sect's ancestor was an elite among humans, he had a habit of saying incomprehensible things when he was alive. Now that he had become an artifact spirit, he became even more sensitive amidst his fear all day.He felt that he was going to die. This was a sign that Demon Xu was about to devour him. Hence, in his horror, he hurriedly shouted before Xu Qing could agree."Master, I can't hold it in anymore. My breakthrough is here…" As he spoke, the Diamond Sect's ancestor's soul body erupted as he forcefully attempted the breakthrough. In fact, his eyes were red and he had gone completely crazy.'I want to break through before the shadow!' He roared inwardly. Amidst the eruption, soul shadows rose from the black iron stick and balls of fog rapidly formed in his body like dark clouds.They continued to collide with each other. Traces of lightning flashed through his entire body, causing the Diamond Sect's ancestor to involuntarily let out a blood-curdling scream. Xu Qing was shocked.The cultivation art the Diamond Sect's ancestor cultivated was an incomplete version that could turn cultivators into artifact spirits. The name of this cultivation art also revealed that it was extraordinary. It was called… Great Yin Lightning Spirit Transformation!There was no way to investigate the origin of this cultivation art. It seemed to have been created by some almighty figure through reference from lightning souls.Once one cultivated it to the small success stage, they would be able to transform their body into Lightning Spirit Body.The first part of this stage required talent. At the same time, this was also a process of accumulation.As for the second part, they had to have the willpower to suicide to become a soul body. Then, they would borrow the accumulation of cultivation in the first part to transform into an artifact spirit. They could begin the third part and transform into Lightning Spirit Body.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Once they turned into Lightning Spirit Body, they were considered to have reached the small success stage.However, this was only the postnatal lightning spirit. Only when one reached mid success could they transform into an innate lightning spirit. As for the large success stage… the cultivation art did not have it.What the Diamond Sect's ancestor was desperately trying to break through to was to transform himself into the postnatal lightning spirit. This process was extremely painful and required him to borrow the help of the clouds to collide in his body to produce more lightning.In the end, he had to let the lightning penetrate his soul to attract the heavenly lightning and cleanse his soul.Seeing the Diamond Sect's ancestor screaming and wailing, Xu Qing took a deep breath.His gaze completely shifted away from the shadow and half of his attention was on the Diamond Sect's ancestor. The other party's current state made Xu Qing faintly feel that something was amiss.At the same time, he was also rapidly weighing whether his iron stick would be damaged if the Diamond Sect's ancestor collapsed.As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor's miserable cry, not only did it attract Xu Qing's attention, but the bubbles on the black pool formed by the shadow also paused for a moment before increasing the speed of its emergence…Just like that, under the competition and madness between the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor, more and more clouds appeared in the Diamond Sect's ancestor's body and the collision became stronger.Bolts of lightning slowly accumulated in his soul and continued to swim around. After they filled his entire soul body, the instant the Diamond Sect's ancestor's body was about to collapse, a bolt of lightning finally broke through a gap and crawled out of the top of his head.In an instant, a large amount of lightning flowed out of this gap and surrounded the Diamond Sect's ancestor's entire body, causing his aura to strengthen rapidly.All of this allowed the Diamond Sect's ancestor to heave a sigh of relief in his heart. He felt that it hadn't been easy for him. However, when he thought of the subsequent baptism, he wailed inwardly.He was very clear that the process of breaking through was extremely dangerous. If he wasn't careful, he might disappear like smoke. If it was when he was alive, he would have chosen to give up without hesitation.This personality was also one of the reasons why his magic aperture opening was very slow.In reality, there were a few opportunities in his life that could speed up the opening of his magic aperture. However, he needed to risk his life, so he had given them up and retreated.This hesitation appeared now as well. However, at this moment, the roars coming from the black pool formed by the shadow became increasingly intense. In fact, the pool even began to bulge!This swelling wasn't a bubble but a new existence that had formed in the pool. It was struggling to stand up and as it continued to form, an aura that exceeded Qi Condensation spread out from the pool.This aura was very intense and reached the Foundation Building realm in the next instant. However, it wasn't over. This scene clearly indicated that the shadow was at the critical moment of breaking through and could succeed at any time. This caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor's expression to be sinister. He stared fixedly at the black pool formed by the shadow. After that, his eyes turned red and revealed madness as he roared."Lightning!"As soon as the word came out of his mouth, the sky outside suddenly rumbled. Dark clouds filled the sky and a huge bolt of lightning was brewing in it. It swam in sections and formed the shape of a distorted character as it rumbled toward the island.When this bolt of lightning landed on the ground, it penetrated the soil and seeped into the depths of the mineshaft. It appeared above the Diamond Sect's ancestor's head and ruthlessly struck him.The Diamond Sect's ancestor's entire body trembled. A large amount of external lightning surged into his body and fused with the lightning he emitted.These lightning bolts continued to gather. There were more and more of them, and they became more and more astonishing. As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, his screams became even more mournful. His body began to turn transparent, as though he was about to collapse.The black pool formed by the shadow was shocked by this scene. However, very soon, the figure inside struggled intensely and suddenly rose. It was obvious that it was also desperately trying to complete its breakthrough as soon as possible.Xu Qing's expression changed.He looked at the shadow and then at the Diamond Sect's ancestor. A hint of strangeness appeared in his eyes but he didn't speak.Time flowed by and very soon, the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed. As the Diamond Sect's ancestor's miserable cries became increasingly tragic, the lightning outside his body finally gathered. Finally, under the low roar of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, all the lightning followed the top of his head and suddenly blasted into his body.The Diamond Sect's ancestor's entire body trembled. His body was being changed by the lightning at a speed visible to the naked eye. All the parts of his soul body were affected and reformed.Gradually, when all the lightning was completely absorbed by the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he suddenly looked at the black iron stick at the side and swallowed it. Countless lightning bolts directly bombarded the iron stick.He was using his body as a furnace, the lightning as a hammer, and his soul power as fire to rebuild the black iron stick.The lightning continued to bombard and the Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled even more.With every bombardment, the black iron stick would be tempered a little and there would be an additional lightning rune on it.The Diamond Sect's ancestor roared and screamed, but he didn't give up. After the bombardment reached ten times, twenty times, thirty times, forty times…The black iron stick became increasingly pitch-black and the sharpness exceeded the past. The lightning runes on it shone intensely and even Xu Qing felt that the light was piercing.Finally, after the lightning struck for the 49th time, the Diamond Sect's ancestor reached his limit. He had no choice but to spit out the black iron stick.At the next instant, the 49 runes on the black iron stick all shone. An aura that surpassed Qi Condensation and even early Foundation Building erupted.Amidst this eruption, the Diamond Sect's ancestor's figure appeared on the black iron stick.His body had changed drastically.Although his appearance was still the same as before, his entire body flickered with countless bolts of lightning that continued to circle and swim with an astonishing aura. His body was even translucent, as though he had transformed into a lightning body.As for the lightning, it didn't cause any harm to him. It seemed to be one with him.An incomparably violent aura spread out from the Diamond Sect's ancestor, giving Xu Qing the feeling that he was facing a ball of life fire cultivator.Xu Qing could clearly sense an even more terrifying fluctuation from the lightning runes on the black iron stick.Clearly, its current state wasn't its combat form. One could imagine that once it unleashed its full might, it would probably be able to match the strength of two balls of life fire.The reason for this was related to the fact that the Diamond Sect's ancestor was a Foundation Building cultivator and also had a great connection with his cultivation art. After overlapping, it formed his earth-shattering breakthrough this time! "I didn't let Master down. I…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor sensed his strength and was excited. He felt that it hadn't been easy for him.However, he didn't forget that his life soul was with Xu Qing, so he wouldn't get carried away.He was about to say some flattering words when the black pool formed by the shadow at the side seemed to have received an unprecedented stimulation and erupted. The existence inside finally rushed out completely.The shadow… also changed drastically!It was no longer what it was before. Instead, it transformed into the shape of a large tree on the ground. In front of Xu Qing and the Diamond Sect's ancestor, the black shadow in the shape of a large tree rapidly spread its branches and leaves, gradually growing the shape of fruits one after another.After that, these fruits all cracked open and red eyes appeared one after another!There were over a hundred of these eyes densely packed together. At that moment, they all opened and abruptly looked at Xu Qing.A hint of ferocity erupted from its hundred or so eyes.A ghastly mouth appeared on the tree. It was filled with sharp teeth and emitted a strange sound that Xu Qing seemed to have heard somewhere before."Krrk, krrk, krrk… krrk, krrk…"This sound was like that of grinding teeth.

Chapter 245 Suppress! Suppress!! Suppress!!!
The black tree formed by the shadow was strange, incomparably so.The hundred or so eyes on it emitted an astonishing red light, illuminating the mine like a world of blood. The ferocity they emitted was extremely obvious.This ferocity contained intense rage.It was as though the shadow had been enduring for a long time. At this moment, as it broke through, all the negative emotions in its heart couldn't be suppressed and began to erupt.However, what was strange was that the ferocity and rage of the shadow didn't all rush toward Xu Qing. Instead, half of it was targeted toward the Diamond Sect's ancestor.Xu Qing had suppressed it daily for a long time. Originally, all of its killing intent should have been targeted toward Xu Qing. However, it was obvious that some of the actions of the Diamond Sect's ancestor had astonishing effects in attracting hatred.The Diamond Sect's ancestor had a solemn expression as lightning swam around his body. He looked at the shadow solemnly but he was overjoyed inwardly. He thought to himself, 'Little Shadow, Little Shadow, well done. This is how it should be, you should rebel openly like this.'The more this was the case, the more stable his status would be.With this thought in mind, the Diamond Sect's ancestor let out a low roar."Vile shadow, are you trying to devour our master!!"As he spoke, the Diamond Sect's ancestor instantly arrived between Xu Qing and the shadow, looking loyal and protective of his master.At the same time that he locked onto the shadow, the lightning runes on the iron stick began to shine and a terrifying aura spread out.A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He didn't care about the shadow's ferocity at this moment. Instead, he quickly thought about the source of the familiar sounds.At the next instant, Xu Qing's expression suddenly changed. He recalled the origin of this voice!"Giant and the Dragon Carriage!"Xu Qing's mind shook. At that moment, he suddenly heard a muffled rumbling sound from the outside world.The sound was low, as though a heavy object had landed on the ground, forming intense fluctuations that caused the sea to surge, causing the island he was on to tremble.At the same time, under the sea on the island, Xu Qing's Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur rapidly manifested and looked into the distance.The instant it looked over, its body rippled intensely.Thick fog spread out from the distant sea. As the sound of heavy objects landing on the ground became increasingly deep, the sound of iron chains also followed.From afar, one could see a huge giant slowly walking over. His body was extremely huge and was covered in tentacles that were like his hair. Every step he took caused the bottom of the sea to tremble, stirring up a violent torrent that swept up a thick fog filled with dust.As he moved forward, one could clearly see the shocking black iron chains on his body.These iron chains bound his body to a bronze dragon carriage.This dragon carriage carried traces of the passage of time and looked dilapidated with many areas covered in rust. It was slightly tilted to the side as it was pulled, leaving a long mark on the bottom of the sea.Regardless of whether it was the giant or the dragon carriage, they were both enormous. Compared to them, Xu Qing was simply insignificant. In his eyes, either of them was like a mountain that could hold up the sky.This was especially so for the tall carriage. There were exquisite and majestic carvings on it that were filled with the feeling of an emperor's weapon. It was as though only supreme noble spirits could use this dragon carriage!As the giant walked over and the dragon carriage was revealed, the sea rumbled.Terrifying waves surged into the sky and formed a tsunami.The giant emitted a terrifying aura that surpassed the strength of Binding by countless times. In an instant, Xu Qing's Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur shattered into pieces.Xu Qing's eyes instantly felt a piercing pain and blood flowed out of them. The walls of the mineshaft couldn't withstand it either.Cracks rapidly formed and collapsed, causing the seawater to pour over.This also caused Xu Qing to see the giant in the distance with his own eyes instead of using the plesiosaur's eyes.The other party's aura caused his mind to shake intensely.Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all. The life lantern in his body was ignited and he activated the Mystic Brilliance Form. It was as though a volcano had erupted in his body. While he resisted with all his might, this close distance also allowed him to see the murals carved on the outer surface of the dragon carriage clearly!A handsome youth in luxurious clothes and an emperor's crown was shown in the murals.He was sitting in the dragon carriage and was propping his chin with a hand as he reviewed a bamboo slip.The entire mural was exquisite and the carvings were lifelike.Even the youth's expression and brows were clear. He seemed to have seen some interesting records and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly with a smile.As for the dragon carriage he was in, it was pulled by a giant running toward the sky with five golden dragons wrapped around his body.This giant was extraordinary. Although he was only carved on a mural, it still allowed those who saw him to sense his powerful aura.At the same time, the giant on the mural seemed to want to turn his head and look at the youth behind him.His expression was filled with loyalty and a hint of fanaticism. It was as though to him, the youth behind him was his fate. To be able to pull the carriage for the other party was his glory.The murals didn't end here. In the next few murals, Xu Qing saw the youth with the crown walking down the dragon carriage after it passed through the clouds and arrived at the highest sky. He transformed into… the sun. He hung high in the sky and his light illuminated the ground!The last carving portrayed that at dusk, the sun transformed back to the youth and returned to the carriage. He sat down again and was pulled by the giant straight to the sea.This series of murals caused a wave of emotions to surge in Xu Qing's mind. While he was feeling these intense emotions, a sound rang out from the mouth of the giant.Krrk, krrk.The strange voice echoed, as though it was responding to the shadow!As for Xu Qing's shadow, although it was in the sea right now and couldn't be seen by others, Xu Qing's perception still sensed that it was still in the form of the bizarre tree. Amidst its ferocity and madness, it let out another sound.Krrk, krrk.The giant's body trembled as he walked toward Xu Qing. The closer he got, the more palpitations Xu Qing felt.Xu Qing cast a deep glance at the giant in the distance and chose to retreat. At the same time, the purple crystal in his body erupted with full force and directly suppressed the shadow.He took out the magic ship and immediately leaped out of the sea.It was early in the morning in the outside world. The sun was shining brightly and when it landed on Xu Qing's body, it also clearly revealed his shadow on the deck of the ship.The shadow was twisting, as though it was crazily resisting Xu Qing's suppression.Amidst this distortion, all its forms changed and tentacles extended out from the tree. It was actually gradually becoming similar to the dragon-carriage giant.Xu Qing's eyes revealed killing intent. The 44 magic apertures in his body circulated and magic power surged into the purple crystal on his chest.The purple crystal trembled from the huge force. A blurry purple light emitted from Xu Qing's chest and landed on the distorted shadow.It wasn't over with just one time. Xu Qing decisively suppressed it more than 50 times!The shadow trembled intensely but it was still letting out a low roar. All its eyes were red and its open mouth seemed to be about to make a sound. However, Xu Qing let out a cold snort and simply fused the power of his life fires into the purple crystal. At the same time, he waved his right hand, causing the shadow of a huge black umbrella to appear. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  As soon as the black umbrella appeared, the color of the sky changed and the wind and clouds churned. Xu Qing covered the shadow with it, blocking the sunlight and cutting off some of its connection with the outside world.Outsiders couldn't see the shadow under the umbrella.However, Xu Qing could clearly sense that after the shadow's connection with the outside world was severed, it revealed panic and struggled intensely."Fool." Xu Qing slowly spoke. As his life fires fused into the purple crystal, the crystal was activated to a greater extent, erupting with an unprecedented suppressive force, forming a corporeal purple halo that rumbled toward the shadow.Three times, seven times, 16 times!The might of this suppression under the strengthening of life fires was much greater than before. The shadow's entire body trembled and it gradually couldn't struggle anymore. It also found it difficult to make a sound.At the same time, under Xu Qing's close observation, as the black umbrella enveloped the shadow and as he forcefully suppressed it, finally… the dragon-carriage giant's footsteps stopped.As though he had lost his senses, the giant slowly turned around and pulled the dragon carriage deeper into the sea, returning to who knows where.After confirming that the giant had left and the palpitations had dissipated, Xu Qing coldly looked at the shadow which was trembling intensely as it realized that something bad was going to happen."Your plan has failed," Xu Qing calmly said.The shadow trembled and its form changed from its previous appearance. Its tentacles disappeared and it transformed into a tree again. All the eyes on it were still red but it didn't dare to emit a ferocious glint. Instead, it revealed a fawning expression.At that moment, the sun rose into the sky. The sunrise on the sea was even more spectacular than on the shore. It was as though the sun had flown out of the sea's bedroom and headed straight for the sky. The fiery red light illuminated the surroundings like a red fire that wanted to burn the world.Even the black Forbidden Sea couldn't compete for brilliance at this moment. It was as though the sun was the only main character.However, Xu Qing wasn't in the mood to pay attention now. With a wave of his right hand, the black umbrella dissipated and the shadow reappeared.As the sunlight grew denser, the shadow reflected on the deck could be seen with the naked eye. It was very clear.However, compared to before, after being suppressed many times, its color wasn't as dark as when it had just broken through. Now, under Xu Qing's cold gaze, its trembling became even more intense."Wrong… I…"As soon as his emotions fluctuated, the purple crystal in Xu Qing's body released its suppression.Ten times, 30 times, 70 times, 120 times…Xu Qing simply sat cross-legged at the side and looked at the distant sky with no intention of stopping. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was very excited at the start but as he saw this, his heart couldn't help but tremble.He looked at the shadow that was constantly being torn under the suppression, looking miserable and dim. It could not even keep its form and even its aura was weak like it was on the verge of death. He then looked at the expressionless Xu Qing and couldn't help but speak in a low voice."Master, it… it's going to die."Xu Qing glanced at the Diamond Sect's ancestor."You sympathize with it?""Absolutely not!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor felt goosebumps from Xu Qing's gaze and hurriedly patted his chest loudly. In fact, the force was so great that it sent some lightning flying."Master, let's kill this traitorous shadow together!" As he spoke, his body rumbled with lightning as he headed straight for the shadow. He did his best to assist, afraid that he would be too slow.

Chapter 246 Warning
Xu Qing didn't care about the Diamond Sect's ancestor's performance. While suppressing the shadow, he looked at the distant sky.The scene of him obtaining the shadow for the first time appeared in his mind.That was in the jungle forbidden zone. When he and the Thunder Team killed the black-scaled wolf pack, the instant a black-scaled wolf died, its shadow spread over as though it wanted to parasitize him.The purple crystal also underwent a true change at that time, sealing this shadow.From then on, his shadow mutated.To be precise, his shadow should have become the carrier of the black-scaled wolf's shadow. The two had fused together.The fact that the other party could absorb anomalous substances made Xu Qing's cultivation even smoother. His body had become pure. At the same time, the shadow also grew stronger as it absorbed the anomalous substances.In the following days, other than being a support, there were no other changes to the shadow. After Xu Qing discovered that he could control the shadow, the other party became his hidden trump card.This lasted until the time when the shadow revealed a hint of spirituality. After that, it was the mute youth's reminder and the act of extinguishing the Spirit Breath Lantern when the other party really woke up on the merfolk island.From then on, not only did the shadow reveal its spirituality, but it also revealed a certain level of intelligence.Xu Qing had expected all of this.His cultivation was stronger than the shadow from the start. Moreover, with the suppression by the purple crystal, although he had some reservations, he still allowed the shadow to become stronger. Following that, the scene of the backlash appeared.Xu Qing wasn't surprised by the shadow's backlash. This was within his expectations.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟   What he was surprised at was that the shadow could attract the giant and the dragon carriage. This allowed him to make more guesses at the shadow's origins."But no matter what, to me, the disadvantages outweigh the benefits." Xu Qing calmly looked at the shadow as he spoke.His tone caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor's heart to tremble. The shadow also clearly sensed that something was different from usual. It emitted even more terrified emotions that were extremely intense, as though it was begging for mercy."Since that's the case, what's the use of having you?" Xu Qing closed his eyes and lifted his right hand, pressing down on the shadow on the deck without hesitation.This time around, the purple light didn't spread out to suppress it. Instead, it followed Xu Qing's right hand and directly landed on the shadow's body. At the next instant, the ship rumbled. The shadow couldn't withstand it anymore and let out an unprecedented mournful cry.There was also a mix of pain and anger that spread out and gushed into Xu Qing's perception.Xu Qing didn't bother with the emotions and continued to suppress it.The shadow's miserable wails caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor to be shaken to the core. He instinctively retreated a little. When he looked at Xu Qing, his eyes revealed nervousness.Amidst the rumbling and screams, the shadow became even fainter. After that, it shattered and transformed from its tree state to an ordinary shadow.The wails also slowly weakened from mournful to pleading. At the same time, emotions of weakness spread out.Xu Qing was expressionless and continued to suppress it.180 times, 240 times, 320 times…His purple light continued to erupt as it suppressed the shadow again and again. The shadow had already become blurry and its screams became weaker and weaker. Xu Qing's eyes revealed a resolute gaze.He wanted to completely erase it. As for how he would deal with the anomalous substances after the shadow died, Xu Qing wasn't too worried.It was a matter of priorities. His purple crystal was the main and the shadow was the secondary.Although the shadow could absorb anomalous substances, since the purple crystal could seal it, it could also seal other shadow-like creatures. At most, after killing it, he would make a trip to the forbidden zone and find a new seal to replace it.Hence, even though the shadow was extremely faint now, his suppression continued. The 350th time, the 460th time, the 570th time, the 680th time… The entire process didn't stop at all.This lasted until the shadow continued to fade and it had no choice but to shrink and gather into a ball, making its color no longer so light but a little denser. Its form changed to that of a small person and it assumed a kneeling posture, continuously kowtowing and begging for mercy.Xu Qing coldly looked at the shadow person who kept kowtowing, and pressed down again.It was shattered by a single palm strike.The screams stopped abruptly.Xu Qing's expression was calm. He sat under the sunlight and no shadow appeared beside him. However, he didn't care about this strange scene. He stood up and walked to the edge of the magic boat, lowering his head to look at the black sea.Under the sunlight, if he had a shadow, the location of the shadow should be reflected on the sea that was filled with anomalous substances.After standing there for a long time, Xu Qing walked back to the bow and calmly spoke."Get out here!"The deck was quiet.Xu Qing laughed. The cold glint in his eyes appeared once again and the purple light on his chest flickered faintly. The instant he was about to continue using the suppression, the shadow that had collapsed earlier appeared while trembling.The instant it appeared, it rapidly shrunk and transformed into a small person who quickly kowtowed. Its pleading intent was much stronger than before."Too slow." Xu Qing spoke and suppressed it again.The small person let out a miserable wail as it collapsed.Xu Qing was expressionless. He closed his eyes and meditated. He sensed that it would be a little troublesome to kill this shadow. Hence, he studied the purple crystal and searched for a way to completely kill the shadow.Time flowed by and very soon, it was noon. When the sun was at its strongest, Xu Qing opened his eyes and calmly looked at the deck amidst the extreme nervousness of the Diamond Sect's ancestor. "Get out here."At the next instant, the shadow condensed at an astonishing speed, as though it was afraid that it would be tortured again if it was too slow.Although the shadow was very faint, after more than two hours of recovery, it barely had an outline and returned to the shape of a tree.At that moment, other than pleading, the emotions transmitted through its trembling were ten times more fearful than before."You've been by my side for a long time and should know my personality."Xu Qing coldly looked at the shadow. He wanted to kill it but it would take time to study the crystal. Hence, as he stared at it, Xu Qing slowly spoke after the other party's terror grew increasingly intense."I'll give you three months to change my mind about killing you. If you can't do it…" Xu Qing didn't continue.The shadow trembled and kept kowtowing, as though it was promising."Now, tell me, how are you different from before after you advanced?" Xu Qing glanced at the shadow."Bite… control…" The shadow tried its best to transmit a message, but it was too weak now. Perhaps it was because of its characteristics, it was very difficult for it to complete the complete expression of its language even after it advanced. It could only try its best to explain.Xu Qing frowned. The other party's description was too simple. He needed to know exactly what the shadow's ability was after it advanced. This concerned some arrangements in future battles."Master, leave it to me!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor finally found an opportunity and hurriedly spoke. Lightning flashed outside his body, causing him to quickly arrive in front of the shadow. He stared at the shadow's hundred or so eyes and asked in a low voice."I'll ask. If I am right, blink your eyes. If I am wrong, nod. Now, tell me what is this bite you are talking about. Bite anomalous substances? Bite flesh? Bite shadows?"The shadow looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor with an unfriendly gaze. However, it had no choice at this moment. Its description wasn't clear, so it could only listen. Very soon, when it heard the Diamond Sect's ancestor say bite shadows, it hurriedly blinked."Bite yourself? Bite others'?"One bite? All of them?""That's called devouring… After devouring, control? Controlling the body? Controlling the soul?"After some communication, the Diamond Sect's ancestor came to a realization and quickly looked at Xu Qing."Master, I understand. What Little Shadow means is that it can devour other people's shadows and control their bodies the moment it completely devours their shadows. However, it can't control Master because there's something that it fears!" After the Diamond Sect's ancestor finished speaking, the shadow clearly revealed an emotion of agreement and quickly nodded.However, it quickly reacted and shook its head.In the end, it looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor in confusion. Clearly, Xu Qing's unprecedented suppression this time had damaged its intelligence. Its intelligence was even inferior than in the past."Little Shadow, you have to remember. Blink your eyes when I am right and nod your head when I am wrong. This will make it convenient for me to understand what you are trying to say," the Diamond Sect's ancestor said with a kind expression. One couldn't tell his intentions.When the shadow heard this, it hurriedly blinked.The smile of the Diamond Sect's ancestor became even gentler, but he thought to himself, 'Little fart shadow, you still dare to show hostility to me. Let's see how I'll punish you in the future. As long as you're used to my explanation and nod when you're in the wrong, I have too many ways to make you suffer.'Xu Qing didn't bother with the Diamond Sect's ancestor's thoughts. After hearing about the shadow's ability, he was a little moved.To him, this ability was very strange. At the same time, Xu Qing knew that the item the shadow feared was the purple crystal."Anything else?""Eye… observe…" The shadow hurriedly spoke. After saying that, it looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor explained after another round of communication."It also has an ability to hide its eye in someone else's shadow, allowing Master to observe through it.""Domain…" The shadow spoke again.The Diamond Sect's ancestor thought about it and asked a few questions. After confirming what the other party wanted to say, he turned to look at Xu Qing and respectfully spoke."Master, the shadow said that it can also form something similar to a shadow domain but it can't last for long. However, once it's activated, its ability will increase by a large margin in the domain."Hearing the Diamond Sect's ancestor's explanation, the shadow clearly felt comfortable. It looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor and felt that the other party wasn't as hateful as before, so it quickly blinked.Xu Qing fell into deep thought. The changes in the Diamond Sect's ancestor after the breakthrough could be seen with the naked eye, while the shadow had become more strange after the breakthrough. By coordinating with them, his attacks could become more varied.After some thought, Xu Qing looked at the sea and recalled the giant and the dragon carriage.Gradually, he thought of the secret art engraved in the dragon carriage that Elder Zhao had mentioned.Emperor-level secret art, Golden Crow Refines All Life!"How can I enter the dragon carriage to learn this secret art…" Xu Qing was tempted. He looked at the sea and pondered. The Diamond Sect's ancestor squatted beside the shadow and persuaded."Little Shadow, I know that you actually don't like Master, right?"The shadow was stunned and hurriedly nodded."You shouldn't be like this. This old man has read many ancient books. In them, anyone who rebels won't have a good ending. Of course, I know that you're not convinced. You think that the vast sky is where you belong, so you want to counterattack and kill the great master. Isn't that so?"When Xu Qing heard this, he looked over.The shadow trembled under Xu Qing's gaze and nodded carefully.

Chapter 247 Emperor Level Opportunity
Xu Qing knew that the shadow was deceived by the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Its spirit had dimmed and its wisdom was affected because of the suppression.Even so, he still had the urge to suppress it again.However, he was reasonable after all. Hence, he suppressed the thought of suppressing and glared at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor hurriedly revealed a fawning expression and didn't continue to bait the shadow.Xu Qing looked at the shadow and suddenly spoke."How did you attract the dragon carriage giant? What exactly are you? Are there other existences like you?"The shadow shivered and tried its best to express."Connect… Shadow…" With that, it hurriedly looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor squatted down and asked in a low voice. After the shadow continued to blink and nod, the Diamond Sect's ancestor turned his head and bowed to Xu Qing before respectfully speaking."Master, what Little Shadow is saying is that it doesn't know what it is either. From the moment it gained consciousness, it has been a shadow that can parasitize and sleep in the host's shadow." Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ At this point, the Diamond Sect's ancestor blinked. When Xu Qing asked if there were other existences like the shadow, he sensed a hint of hidden killing intent in Xu Qing's words.Hence, he spoke in a low voice."The shadow said that it hasn't sensed an existence like it until now… However, I feel like there are very few unique things in this world.""As for the matter of attracting the dragon carriage giant, it doesn't know. For some reason, when it saw the giant, it could instinctively circulate the other party's voice and summon it. My analysis might be that its formation is related to the dragon carriage?"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He only believed a portion of the shadow's words but the other party had said so much. There was no point in continuing to suppress and interrogate it.Moreover, the probability of it saying the truth was very high."It can attract the dragon carriage giant… If I use this well, it will also be a trump card."Xu Qing sat on the magic ship and continued to look at the sea. It was already afternoon. Although the sunlight was still bright and dense, it seemed to be flowing.Elder Zhao's description of the giant and the dragon carriage kept echoing in his mind. The more he thought about it, the more tempted Xu Qing became and the desire grew increasingly intense.It would have been fine if he had only encountered it once. Now that he had encountered it again and the shadow clearly had a way to lure it over, Xu Qing felt that if he planned it, it wasn't impossible for him to have the opportunity to obtain the emperor-level cultivation art.However, this matter was too difficult. Xu Qing recalled the feeling he had when he saw the dragon carriage giant earlier. The pressure from the other party caused his body and soul to be unable to withstand it.He could imagine that if the giant got any closer, his body would definitely collapse.Xu Qing had once felt a similar feeling in the merfolk race's murals. Although his cultivation was different from back then, the level of this dragon-carriage giant clearly surpassed the divine existence in the murals."If I can't get close, I can't step onto the dragon carriage. Moreover, even if I use some methods to forcefully barge through at all costs, as long as that giant turns its head and takes a look, I'll definitely be unable to withstand its might.""I wonder how the Lord of the Seven Sects Alliance broke in back then…" Xu Qing sighed with emotion. He felt that unless the giant was in a deep sleep, it was impossible for him to enter the dragon carriage."Shadow, I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself. Summon the dragon carriage giant and cover it. Imprint the emperor-level cultivation art inside for me." Xu Qing looked at the shadow.The shadow instantly emitted a clear fluctuation of horror."Restrict… afraid…"The Diamond Sect's ancestor was in high spirits. Without needing Xu Qing to speak, he hurriedly went up to communicate and quickly turned to explain."Master, Little Shadow said that there are strange divine fluctuations on that giant's body. It can't get close and will be restricted. Moreover, it sensed that the giant doesn't have a shadow, so the shadow eye can't be placed inside." "I also asked why it summoned the giant just now. It said that it wanted to borrow the pressure of the dragon carriage giant to shock Master to death. It felt that it could last longer than Master under that pressure. As long as Master died, it would be free. Sigh, Little Shadow, how can you be so muddle-headed?"When Xu Qing heard this, he glanced at the shadow and recalled the backlash from the shadow earlier. He raised his hand and suppressed it, causing the shadow to let out a blood-curdling scream. After it recovered, the emotions it emitted were horror and pleading.Xu Qing didn't look at the shadow. He looked at the gradually setting sun as all kinds of thoughts raced through his mind. Finally, when the sky darkened, he recalled the murals on the dragon carriage and… the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts he had encountered when he first went out to sea."There are wonders in the Endless Sea that mortals haven't heard of. With the Golden Crow Chi Yang as a companion, a hundred sounds form a tune - Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon." "God was delighted. When He closed his eyes and looked, the Endless Sea became Forbidden. The hundred sounds became Yin."These sentences were the sea record's description of the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts. When Xu Qing recalled them, his heart raced slightly as many thoughts quickly rose in his mind."Elder Zhao said that the dragon carriage is the sun's carriage, so the youth in the murals on the dragon carriage should be the sun. Moreover, the murals also portray the scene of him transforming into the sun.""This point matches the description in the sea record. The sun is the Golden Crow. When it is time for sunrise, it rides the dragon carriage to the sky and transforms into the sun. When it is time for sunset, it returns on the dragon carriage and listens to Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon in its bedroom.""If that's true, then that giant must have listened to Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon many times when it was alive. Even though it has fallen now, it still has some instincts to pull the carriage under the Forbidden Sea. If it hears Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon again, will it be dazed…"When Xu Qing thought of this, his eyes gleamed.If he wanted to accomplish this, he first had to search for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts. Secondly, he had to have an item that could store music. Moreover, the quality of this item was extremely important. Xu Qing looked at his storage bag where there was a sound-catching bottle.Other than these conditions, he also had to find the dragon carriage giant.The Forbidden Sea was too large. The other party was usually in the deep sea and would only be seen occasionally. It was basically impossible for him to take the initiative to search."If my judgment is feasible, then if I can think of it, others should be able to think of it too. Perhaps the Seven Sects Alliance's headquarters did this back then.""However, I have an additional ability compared to them. Even if they think of this method, they can only passively seek opportunities to encounter it. However, the shadow can take the initiative to summon it.""The difference between the probability of active and passive state is extremely great."Xu Qing was tempted. He felt that he had to speed up his plan. Even though the difference in taking the initiative and being passive was huge, as long as someone was willing, they could still do it.In fact, it was very likely that someone was already prepared to search for the dragon carriage.Xu Qing clearly remembered Elder Zhao saying that every time the dragon carriage appeared, it would search for an inheritor. As long as the emperor-level cultivation art engraved on it was comprehended by someone, it would dim on its own. The giant would then return to the bottom of the sea with the dragon carriage and wait for many years to accumulate the power of inheritance before appearing again."This also indirectly shows that cultivation arts of that level might only be obtained through inheritance and it's difficult to impart it to others. However, whether it's true or not will be determined in the future."Xu Qing felt that what he thought should be feasible. He planned to give it a try."Then, the first thing I have to do is to search for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts!" Xu Qing took a deep breath. He knew that the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts only appeared at night and didn't exist for long. Whether he could find it depended on luck.Hence, Xu Qing didn't hesitate. He spread out his perception with all his might and controlled the magic ship to move forward rapidly on the Forbidden Sea, beginning to search for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.Just like that, days passed. Xu Qing's search wasn't very smooth. After all, the Forbidden Sea was too vast. Although the difficulty of searching for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts couldn't be considered a needle in a haystack, it was about the same. It depended on luck.However, Xu Qing wasn't in a hurry. During this month, he was also familiarizing himself with the changes to the black iron stick. After the Diamond Sect's ancestor became a lightning spirit, the speed and lethality of the iron stick became astonishing.This was especially so after the lightning runes formed by the refinement of the black iron stick shone completely. Xu Qing was quite surprised by the aura that erupted. That speed had completely surpassed that of a Foundation Building cultivator with one ball of life fire and was comparable to two balls of life fire.Although it was slightly inferior, it was enough to be of help to Xu Qing's current cultivation and allow his combat strength to increase greatly. At the same time, Xu Qing understood the abilities of the shadow as well.Xu Qing tested the ability to control other beings after devouring their shadows on a megalodon. He watched helplessly as the shadow devoured its shadow and controlled the megalodon to twist its huge head. The neck broke with a loud cracking sound.This scene was extremely strange, and even the Diamond Sect's ancestor was shocked. He was glad that as an artifact spirit, he didn't have a shadow.The only flaw was that the devouring process was a little slow.Other than that, the shadow's other ability, shadow eyes, also gave Xu Qing a huge surprise. He controlled the shadow to release a hundred shadow eyes and scattered them on many sea beasts. As these sea beasts spread out in a disorderly manner, it was equivalent to Xu Qing having countless eyes.As for the sea beasts he had placed the shadow eye on, they were all those who liked to travel at night and jump on the surface of the sea. Hence, their help in searching for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts was extremely great.Just like that, another month passed.That night, Xu Qing, who was observing through the shadow eyes, suddenly locked onto one of the shadow eyes.Through the shadow, Xu Qing clearly saw… that in that sea area, groups of ghosts were rising into the air."Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts!"

Xu Qing immediately put away the magic ship and activated the Mystic Brilliance Form. The life lantern burned like a volcano and Xu Qing rapidly headed in the direction of the shadow eye!What was parasitized by this shadow eye was a moonfish.This fish was usually hundreds of feet in size. Its head was extremely large and occupied almost 90% of its body. Its short fins, small tail, and its mouth that was always open it look a little stupid and adorable.Its swimming speed wasn't very fast either, and it especially liked light. Regardless of whether it was sunlight or moonlight, it liked both. Hence, although it clearly had the ability to dive to the bottom of the sea, it still appeared on the surface and floated there like a dead fish.This moonfish had a strange ability in the Forbidden Sea. Once it appeared, there would definitely be ferocious injured sea beasts in its surroundings.Most of these sea beasts wouldn't kill the moonfish. Instead, they treated it like a floating rag and rubbed it against their bodies, especially the wound area.The Seven Blood Eyes' sea record also introduced this.It was said that the body of the moonfish would produce some strange mucus. This mucus possessed a certain amount of healing effects, allowing the moonfishes to have a place in the Forbidden Sea.Xu Qing was moving in full speed. According to the direction indicated by the shadow, after flying for a full two hours, he finally saw the souls of malicious ghosts rising into the sky in the distance. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ It was the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.The range wasn't large, about tens of thousands of feet. It was a little different from what Xu Qing had experienced last time. Clearly, the phenomenon of the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts wasn't fixed.Xu Qing was a little worried.He didn't know if his previous judgment was correct, but he had to give it a try. With a wave of his hand, the magic ship appeared and landed on the surface of the sea, stirring up waves. At the same time, the shadow retracted its shadow eye.Xu Qing stepped on the magic ship and controlled it to move forward slowly. He slowly got close to the area of the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts and listened carefully. Waves of strange sounds rang out in his ears.These sounds weren't music at all but ear-piercing sound waves formed by the roars of malicious ghosts. They wailed like ghosts and wolves, causing the listener's mind to be intimidated.Xu Qing's magic ship stopped within the range of the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts. He took out the sound-catching bottle and opened it, before pouring his magic power into it.As thread-like light appeared on the sound-catching bottle and gradually spread, the sound-catching ability of the bottle slowly activated.Xu Qing watched as the malicious ghosts rose into the air and listened to the strange sounds. He recalled the feeling he had when he first encountered the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts, and slowly calmed down.He didn't reject the mournful cries but accepted them.After merging himself with these voices, his mind gradually sank. Time flowed by and unknowingly, a night passed.The next morning, when the first rays of the morning accompanied by the sea breeze blew past his eyelashes and knocked on his window, Xu Qing slowly opened his eyes. There was a hint of sadness hidden in the depths of his eyes but it was quickly hidden in the depths of his heart.The sky was bright.The Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts was over."The night passed so quickly," Xu Qing mumbled. He recalled what he had felt and heard the entire night. The moment he completely calmed down, he finally heard a different voice.Now that he recalled it, he couldn't tell what tune it was.It felt more like a dream to Xu Qing. However, this time, what he dreamed of wasn't Grandmaster Bai's teachings but the scene of him eating snakes with Captain Lei in the scavenger campsite…After a long time, Xu Qing lowered his head and glanced at the sound-catching bottle. He then waved it. Immediately, the sound from last night rang out from the bottle. It was lifelike and exactly the same. In fact, he even closed his eyes and felt that the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts was still continuing. What made Xu Qing feel even more complicated was that he actually felt like he was in a dream again. Vaguely, the scenes in his memory appeared in his mind again. This time, the scene was the scene of him carrying Captain Lei and moving forward outside the scavenger campsite.Even Captain Lei's words from back then appeared in Xu Qing's mind, causing him to involuntarily lose his focus."After this, you have to pay more attention to those scavengers in the campsite.""At night, don't forget to feed those dogs. These little fellows are the most trustworthy ones in the campsite.""Also, you have to remember to eat. Don't eat cold food. Don't find cooking or heating troublesome. Eat it after it's hot… You're still growing, so you can't be careless.""Otherwise, when you get older in the future, you'll know how tough it is. Oh right, don't sleep on the bed boards in the future. Don't be afraid of dirtying the bedding. Remember to bask in the sun after you're done bathing."Xu Qing's body trembled slightly. The sea breeze landed on his body, blowing his robe and hair. However, it couldn't blow away the memories and sadness that rose in his heart.After a long time, Xu Qing sighed softly and lowered his head again. He silently looked at the sound-catching bottle and whispered hoarsely. "It's a pity that I haven't found the heavenfate flower yet…"After a long time, Xu Qing suppressed the thoughts again and hid all his emotions in the depths of his heart. His eyes slowly regained their sharpness and his face revealed determination. The aura on his body turned cold again."I'm still too weak. I have to become stronger!"Xu Qing's gaze was firm. After he looked around and discovered that this place was already very remote, he soared into the air and checked again to confirm that there was no one nearby.Only then did he return to the magic ship. He looked at the sea before suddenly speaking."Shadow, summon the giant."The rising sun scattered gentle light on the calm sea. From afar, the black sea looked like a piece of black jade. While it revealed mystery, it also emitted a hint of decay under the sunlight.Perhaps in the past, the depth of the sea was its majesty. However, in this era, its decay came from the breaths of terrifying existences sleeping at the bottom of the sea.The giant and the dragon carriage were only one of them.Regarding Xu Qing's words, the shadow didn't dare to hesitate at all. Even though it didn't understand why he was doing this, even though it really wanted to put out a question mark and ask, any intelligent creature would become obedient as long as they were controlled by the fear of death.Hence, the instant Xu Qing spoke, the shadow didn't hesitate to open a crack and let out a sound.Krrk, krrk.This grinding sound echoed on the quiet sea. It wasn't very loud but this sound seemed to contain some special signal that could attract the attention of some strange existences.Under Xu Qing's vigilance, the wind slowly rose on the sea.Ripples appeared on the calm surface of the sea. There were more and more of these ripples as the wind grew stronger. They formed undulating waves that chased after each other.The waves were black, like a piece of satin fluttering in the wind. As it swayed continuously, Xu Qing, who was completely focused, observed the bottom of the sea closely through his plesiosaur.Perhaps it was because the area Xu Qing was in was too far away from the place where he had seen the giant and the dragon carriage before, or maybe the giant had moved further away, it took longer than before.The time it took for an incense stick to burn passed. As the seawater rose on a large scale, Xu Qing finally saw the rapids at the bottom of the sea in the distance through the plesiosaur. It was as though there was a colossus striding over rapidly."It's here!"Xu Qing was a little nervous but his gaze became even sharper. The life fire in his body was instantly ignited and the life lantern lit up as well. His aura suddenly soared as he entered the Mystic Brilliance Form.In his eyes, the sea seemed to have been stripped of a portion of its black color. It was no longer so blurry, allowing him to see the majestic giant figure and countless swaying tentacles approaching from the depths of the sea.At this moment, everything in the surroundings slowed down in his eyes. Only the giant's movements didn't change at all. It was as though Xu Qing's Mystic Brilliance Form was completely ineffective in front of it.It walked toward Xu Qing step by step. Gradually, its figure became clearer and clearer. The sound of the iron chains on its body also spread in all directions. The dilapidated bronze dragon carriage behind it also appeared in Xu Qing's eyes.It was rusty and incomparably tall.At that moment, the distance between them was less than 10,000 feet. Although the giant's figure was enveloped by the sea, its height and the terrifying aura it emitted were extremely intense.Xu Qing had never been so close to it before!The first time, he was about 100,000 feet away, so he could only see a rough outline and couldn't see the murals on the dragon carriage clearly.Last time, he was tens of thousands of feet away. Coupled with the increase in his cultivation, he could see the murals clearly.At this moment, as the range between them shortened to less than 10,000 feet, not only did the murals become clearer in Xu Qing's eyes, but there was also a pressure that shook Xu Qing's soul. It enveloped him with an overwhelming force.The Diamond Sect's ancestor instantly trembled and quickly entered the black iron stick. As he resisted with all his might, Xu Qing's mind and body shook. Blood flowed down his nose, and his eyes were bloodshot.Only the shadow was normal. However, it was clearly afraid of Xu Qing's torture. Even though Xu Qing didn't seem to be in a good state, it still didn't dare to take the risk.Xu Qing wiped the blood from his nose and coldly glanced at the shadow. He looked at the sea again before analyzing inwardly. Determination appeared in his eyes."Although the distance is still a little far… I can't wait anymore!"

Chapter 249 Where The Sun Used To Sit
Xu Qing gritted his teeth as he made the decision. He felt that he couldn't wait any longer. He had to consider if the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts' voice was effective against this giant. If it wasn't effective, he had to be prepared to retreat.If it was effective, he didn't know if it would take effect immediately or if it would take some time.Xu Qing immediately waved his hand. Immediately, the sound-catching bottle shone and the sound inside appeared again, drifting away on the sea.Xu Qing held his breath and stared fixedly at the giant under the sea.This giant didn't show any abnormalities under the sound of the sound-catching bottle. It continued to take large strides, as though it had locked onto Xu Qing.9000 feet, 8000 feet, 7000 feet…Xu Qing's mind rumbled and the sense of pressure grew increasingly intense, causing his entire body to feel as though it was being squeezed. His lungs couldn't expand properly under this pressure and it became difficult for him to breathe. Blood filled his eyes."Could it be that it's not what I thought?" Xu Qing looked at the approaching dragon carriage. At that moment, not only could he see the murals more clearly, but he could even faintly see some words carved inside the dragon carriage.Although those words were blurry, they gave Xu Qing a feeling that they were filled with divine intent. They were like the writings of an emperor, majestic and containing the aura of a sovereign."I'm a little unwilling." Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood and a look of deep regret appeared on his face. He sighed and prepared to retreat.Since the sound-catching bottle was ineffective, he was not going to continue to stay. Once the giant got closer, it would be difficult for him to leave safely. The instant Xu Qing was about to retreat, his eyes suddenly narrowed.The giant, who was more than 6,000 feet away from him, paused for the first time. He lifted his chin, revealing the black holes in his listless eyes, and tilted his head as though he was listening.Xu Qing's eyes widened. As his mind trembled intensely, the giant instinctively took another small step forward and crossed 1,000 feet.The pressure from this location was already extremely terrifying. Xu Qing's mind rumbled and blood flowed out of his seven orifices. The Diamond Sect's ancestor wailed and his body was firmly fixed to the deck by an invisible pressure. At this moment, cracking sounds rang out from the entire magic ship, as though it couldn't withstand the pressure.Fortunately, the giant's body paused and didn't move. Only his head kept moving like a puppet. Finally, he maintained the posture of tilting his head, listening carefully.Gradually, some ripples appeared in his black-hole-like eyes and a hint of confusion appeared on his expressionless face!"It's effective!"Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all and a hint of madness appeared on his face. He instantly rushed out rapidly under the Mystic Brilliance Form. When he rushed out, he didn't forget to put away the magic ship. He released his magic power, causing the sound-catching bottle to float in the air.His body rushed into the sea and rushed toward the dragon carriage 5000 feet away.As he got closer, cracks instantly appeared on Xu Qing's body. Cracks rapidly filled his entire body, turning into wounds that started bleeding.His soul was also shaking, as though it was about to collapse. The life fire in his body was also swaying intensely, as though a wind was blowing to extinguish it.If it was an ordinary life fire, the fire would definitely be forcefully extinguished under this pressure. However, Xu Qing's life fire was placed on the life lantern. With a root, it wouldn't be extinguished easily.At this critical moment, Xu Qing waved his hand and a huge black umbrella appeared above his head.As soon as the black umbrella appeared, it was like a canopy that let out black flames which enveloped Xu Qing.The external pressure actually dissipated a little at this moment, causing Xu Qing's entire body to relax. At the same time, the recovery power of the purple crystal circulated fully, nourishing his body.However, at this moment, Xu Qing couldn't care less. His speed erupted. While the giant was still listening, he directly crossed the distance of 5,000 feet and appeared beside the giant.Xu Qing's location was at the waist of the giant. Compared to the giant, his body was like a bug that could be killed with a single slap.Hence, Xu Qing felt an extremely terrifying soul-stirring sensation.At such a close distance, he could even see the rotting of the giant's body. At the same time, he also noticed that the giant's entire body was covered in shocking wounds.There were too many wounds, as though the giant had protected an important existence and blocked all the damage with his body.All of this caused Xu Qing's expression to change.His previous plan was clearly correct.Even with the protection of the canopy and the healing effect of the purple crystal, it still caused his entire body to continuously split open and his body seemed to be about to collapse. However, in the end, he was only facing pressure and the aura that the giant passively emitted. The giant didn't actively target him.The difference between the two was like heaven and earth.At that moment, he whistled past the giant and rushed toward the tall bronze dragon carriage in front of him. He got closer and closer until he finally arrived in front of the tilted emperor's carriage.Although it was covered in rust, it was still filled with the aura of an emperor.Although it was filled with dilapidation, its carvings were still incomparably luxurious.Although it had been buried for countless years, the dignity of an emperor had yet to dissipate.At this moment… It was clearly reflected in Xu Qing's eyes. It was imprinted in his mind and soul!A feeling of reverence rose in his heart.However, the sense of danger from the giant forced Xu Qing to ignore all of this. At that moment, he lifted his right foot and took a step forward, driving his body into the bronze dragon carriage in an instant!This was the place where the sun sat!This was where the Emperor sat!This place was a place that ordinary people couldn't approach!The dragon carriage was too big. The instant Xu Qing stepped in, it was as though he was in a huge palace. He saw the huge throne that occupied half of the space.He saw the countless auspicious totems and paintings in the surroundings.He saw the lampstands that were shattered all over the ground and also saw… countless densely-packed runes carved crookedly on the walls of the dragon carriage!These runes gave off a hurried feeling, as though someone, who didn't want their inheritance to disappear, left them behind before they died.The instant Xu Qing looked over, he felt like endless heavenly lightning bolts had exploded in his mind at the same time, forming an earth-shattering boom that could tear through everything, filling every corner of his body.As his body trembled intensely, countless dazzling lights appeared in front of his eyes. These lights were golden and continuously gathered, transforming into a golden crow with folded wings that rushed into the nine heavens.This golden crow was so large that even without spreading Its wings, It still occupied more than half of the sky. Its entire body shone with golden light like a god and Its aura surpassed all existences Xu Qing had seen. Regardless of whether it was Binding or the Flame Phoenix, they seemed to be ordinary beings in front of It!Its aura was dignified, like an emperor!The records on the Seven Blood Eyes' sea record, the Third Elder's information back then, and the murals Xu Qing had seen outside the dragon carriage told him the same thing.The sun in this world was a vast existence like the ancient king. Its main body wasn't a human but a Golden Crow Divine Bird!It rose at dawn and returned at sunset. Its light illuminated the great earth. Perhaps It didn't cover all of Wanggu, but at least within the range of Its light, It was the god of all living beings.At that moment, Xu Qing's mind rumbled, stirring up monstrous waves. His soul and body trembled.He had an indescribable feeling.That was the surreal feeling of walking into a myth.It was the dazed feeling of stepping into an era before the god's fragmented face appeared.He also felt the shock of standing in the sun carriage that was once high and mighty and worshiped by all living beings.This series of feelings caused Xu Qing's mind to be impacted intensely. The golden crow that looked like an emperor charged into the nine heavens. As It rushed over, Its wings were still folded. However, one could see that every feather on It was shaking, containing an indescribable Dao rhythm.This feeling was similar to the golden statue with the saber Xu Qing had seen in the temple in the scavenger campsite forbidden zone back then. That saber strike back then had shaken him greatly. Even now, the heavenly saber was still one of his trump cards. However, his realm back then was too low and he couldn't even comprehend 10% of it. Hence, he couldn't display more power.However, it was also precisely because of this that one could tell that Xu Qing's comprehension ability exceeded that of ordinary people.His aptitude might be quite good in the Seven Blood Eyes, but in the entire Wanggu Continent, there were many people who surpassed him in terms of pure aptitude.However, since Xu Qing could sense the Dao rhythm of that saber strike at the Qi Condensation Realm, it was enough to show that his comprehension ability was extremely high. click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  His comprehension ability was completely revealed right now. His entire person was already completely immersed in the holy golden crow.He watched as It soared into the nine heavens, broke through the sky, and shook the world.Outside Xu Qing's life lantern, a lump of phantom shadow vaguely appeared. Its appearance quickly became solid from blurry, vaguely forming the outline of the golden crow.This outline was rapidly becoming clear.In Xu Qing's eyes, the Golden Crow Divine Bird that illuminated the world with Its golden light suddenly spread Its wings and waved them fiercely.This was Its first time spreading Its wings!The world shook and cracked. Deafening sounds rang out, like countless thunderclaps exploding. At the same time, it also caused a shocking wave in Xu Qing's mind.His mind was also about to explode. The outline of the golden crow outside the life lantern rapidly changed and formed even faster. At the same time, a large amount of information spread out from the golden crow and surged into Xu Qing's mind, merging into the outline beside the life lantern.This information was like a storm and the content was too majestic. Xu Qing didn't have time to check it at all. At that moment, his body was trembling and the veins on his forehead bulged. His eyes were bloodshot as he endured everything.This was an inheritance!

Chapter 250 Golden Crow Refines All Life
Every time It spread Its wings, it would be the eruption of an inheritance!After an unknown period of time, amidst the earth-shattering turmoil in Xu Qing's mind, the golden crow in his eyes spread Its wings for the second time.This time around, its speed was even faster, and the fluctuations it stirred up were even more terrifying, causing the world to lose color. The wind and clouds churned, and Xu Qing's mind rumbled endlessly.He didn't even notice that blood was flowing out of his nose at this moment, and the sound of the sound-catching bottle in the distance had begun to weaken. The giant, who was focused on it, moved slightly, as though he was about to wake up from his daze.At the next instant, Xu Qing sensed that the Golden Crow Divine Bird, which was soaring higher and higher in the golden sky, had spread Its wings for the third time!This time, every feather on Its black wings shone with a piercing golden light.As It waved Its wings, the sky seemed to split apart. An incomparably terrifying fluctuation spread in all directions, and the sky really cracked.A huge gap formed in the sky. In the shattered sky, it was as though the clouds and fog had been parted, revealing another world. In that world, Xu Qing saw countless races with different appearances. They were all roaring at the sky.As they roared, the Golden Crow Divine Bird leaned over and opened Its mouth at the world, letting out a cry that traveled through time and space.Under this cry, that world… Under Xu Qing's dumbfounded and horrified gaze, it was actually enveloped by black flames. In an instant, it was as though it had been refined. Countless drops of blood rose into the air and gathered into a golden color, rushing toward the golden crow's mouth.From afar, it looked like it was swallowing water!At the next instant, under Xu Qing's shock, the golden crow abruptly turned Its head.Its bright gaze pierced through time, causing the river of time to flow in reverse.It passed through space, shattering the Great Dao of Space.In the end, Its gaze that came from beyond the endless space, landed on Xu Qing.As Xu Qing's mind rumbled, he heard a gentle voice."This is my life art, Golden Crow Refines All Life."At the next instant, an extremely terrifying amount of information crazily surged in, causing Xu Qing to feel as though he had transformed into a small boat on a stormy sea.Blood flowed out of his mouth, his eyes, nose, and ears. As he bled from his seven orifices, all the scenes in front of Xu Qing shattered into pieces. This caused him to return to his senses. At the same time, he also heard the trembling wail of the Diamond Sect's ancestor."Master, wake up quickly. That giant… is about to wake up!!""It's over, it's over. Master, quickly wake up!!!"The sound-catching bottle had already stopped emitting sounds. Under the giant's gaze, it couldn't withstand the pressure and shattered into pieces.As for the giant, his emotions began to fluctuate. His chest heaved as though he was breathing out. The countless tentacles outside his body were twisting.His breath seemed to contain an indescribable force, causing the seawater to dissipate. His tentacles were also incomparably astonishing as amidst their twisting, cracks appeared in the void.It was as though the sound of the sound-catching bottle had evoked some of his memories. He let out a crying-like sound as his emotions erupted. He waved his hands and a tsunami surged into the sky.Waves that were thousands of feet or even ten thousand feet tall rose from the sea. From afar, they looked like curved sea walls that were lifted from the ground. They were majestic and terrifying.At the same time, the giant gradually turned to look at the dragon carriage.As he turned around, his breath landed in the direction he turned, causing the seawater to continuously boil and dissipate. For a moment, the surroundings were clearly filled with astonishing tsunamis but there was nothing near him.The instant Xu Qing opened his eyes, not only did he hear the screams of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, but he also saw the incomparably tall giant outside the dragon carriage with pitch-black eyes.The instant their gazes met, the giant's breath enveloped him.The dragon carriage's material was special, so the giant's breath couldn't destroy it at all. However, Xu Qing's flesh body couldn't withstand it at all. At the next instant, an indescribable pain erupted from Xu Qing's entire body.His face, chest, stomach, and his frontal torso were instantly mangled. It was the same for his hands and feet. Under this breath, his flesh and blood were rapidly wiped away.At this critical moment, a large black umbrella suddenly appeared and blocked in front of Xu Qing, coming into contact with the breath.The black umbrella shook and blocked with all its might. At the same time, Xu Qing trembled and lifted his right hand that only had strings of flesh on it. He took out the disorder teleportation talisman and crushed it!A resplendent teleportation light erupted from the shattered disorder teleportation talisman and enveloped Xu Qing. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared with the black umbrella!As he and the black umbrella disappeared, the giant's breath no longer had any obstruction and gushed into the dragon carriage. After the breath spread out, the giant stared blankly at the empty dragon carriage and let out a sorrowful cry.He didn't care about Xu Qing's arrival or departure. He was only looking at the dragon carriage. Clearly, under the effect of the sound from the sound-catching bottle, his thoughts were stirred and he thought of his master who he had once accompanied.The sound of crying rang through the world.Finally, the giant squatted down and knelt in front of the dragon carriage.The whimpering grew louder and louder, as though he was unwilling to give up and wanted to summon something. However, there was no response. His emotions gradually calmed, as though he had slowly forgotten everything again. Only his instincts were left as he pulled the dragon carriage toward the bottom of the sea.The inheritance was over. He would fall into a deep sleep and wouldn't awaken until a hundred years later…However, the sea wasn't calm. The tsunami earlier stirred up a storm and with this place as the center, it continued to surge in all directions, its range growing larger and larger.On the surface of the sea, which was about thousands of kilometers away and was not yet affected by the disaster, Xu Qing's figure suddenly appeared amidst the flickering light of teleportation and landed on the sea.When the seawater that was filled with anomalous substances touched the wounds all over Xu Qing's body, it caused Xu Qing, whose vision was blurry from the intense pain and serious injuries, to be stimulated intensely. His eyes abruptly widened and he instinctively waved his hand to take out the magic ship. After he climbed onto it with great difficulty, he activated the magic boat's defenses.After that, he lay on the deck and his entire body trembled. Blood kept on flowing out of his injuries and his chest heaved violently.He didn't have much flesh left on his front. It was the same for his hands, legs, and even his face. Many of the exposed bones were shattered and a portion of them even had holes on them.It was a shocking sight.If someone he knew was here, they would find it very difficult to recognize him.Blurry, double images appeared in front of Xu Qing's eyes. He endured the intense desire to close his eyes and swallowed a large number of medicinal pills. He also activated the purple crystal, allowing its recovery power to quickly spread. click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  As the purple light permeated his body, Xu Qing endured the pain as he coldly glanced at the shadow.Under the sunlight, when the shadow was swept by Xu Qing's gaze, it instantly trembled intensely, revealing an extremely obvious intention to curry favor.It was really afraid.Back then, it was the one who had helped Xu Qing obtain the life lantern. Hence, although Xu Qing's injuries were serious at that time, it didn't think much of it. However, this time… Not only was it afraid of Xu Qing's suppressions, but it also personally witnessed Xu Qing's magnificent feat and that indescribable madness.It felt that since this person was so ruthless to himself, how ruthless would he be to others?Hence, it didn't dare to take the opportunity to cause trouble earlier. At this moment, it tried its best to transmit its fawning emotions. It even spread out over a small area to block the sunlight for Xu Qing.The black iron stick at the side also couldn't help but tremble. The Diamond Sect's ancestor's face was pale and his eyes were filled with horror and shock.'I've lived for so many years but I've never seen such a reckless person!!''Previously, in that inexplicable world of the merfolk race, I already felt terror. But now… it was even more direct!!''This Demon Xu is too crazy. If this continues, he might kill himself one day. Once he dies, I'll definitely die too… If he doesn't die from his madness, he will definitely continue to obtain more treasures. In that case, I might be killed one day when I am no longer helpful to him.''There's no solution…' The more the Diamond Sect's ancestor thought about it, the more fear he felt. This feeling was so intense that the Diamond Sect's ancestor even ignored the shadow's fawning toward Xu Qing.He felt that the only way was for him to work even harder and surpass Demon Xu's gains.This thought caused the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor to turn red. He wasn't a person who liked to take risks, but he had no choice now. He felt that if he didn't risk his life, he would definitely lose his life.There was another thing, which was also an important reason why he felt a sense of danger.According to the ancient books he had read, characters who knew too many secrets of others would most likely die a horrible death.At the thought of this, the Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled even more. He finally noticed the shadow's actions and quickly controlled the black iron stick to circle around Xu Qing with an expression of loyalty. If there was the slightest danger, he would definitely risk his life to protect Xu Qing."Master, you can recover in peace. I'll take care of everything!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor's eyes were red as he spoke loudly. After that, he stared fixedly at the shadow. Clearly, he felt that the greatest threat was the shadow.Noticing the shadow's fawning and the Diamond Sect's ancestor's guarantee, Xu Qing fell silent for a moment before calmly glancing at the shadow. He then nodded in appreciation at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.When the Diamond Sect's ancestor saw the appreciation in Xu Qing's expression, he was so excited that he felt like crying. At that moment, all the fear of life and death seemed to have disappeared with Xu Qing's appreciation, allowing him to obtain the greatest relief. What followed was an unprecedented feeling of gratitude.This feeling caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor's body and mind to tremble, as he spoke without thinking."Master!! Unless I'm destroyed, I'll definitely make sure of your safety. I'm even prepared to self-destruct!!"Xu Qing nodded and retracted his gaze. He seemed to be healing with all his might but in reality, he was paying attention to these two as well. He was prepared to instantly suppress the shadow and crush the Diamond Sect's ancestor's life soul if they wanted to counterattack.At the same time, Xu Qing felt that although his injuries were basically equivalent to losing half his life, wasn't he still left with half of it?After experiencing the danger of getting the life lantern and seeing the captain's madness, Xu Qing felt that this was nothing. Hence, although he was in extreme pain and his aura was extremely weak, there was a hint of madness and excitement in his eyes."It was worth it!"Xu Qing struggled to get up and leaned to the side, not caring about the seriousness of the injuries on his body. At this moment, what appeared in his mind was the huge harvest from risking everything!He didn't know how many breaths he had stayed in the dragon carriage.However, he knew that the shadow of the Golden Crow that had formed beside the lantern in his body was no longer an outline but lifelike!!This was an incomparably precious emperor-level cultivation art inheritance seed in the whole Wanggu Continent!!Golden Crow Refines All Life!
