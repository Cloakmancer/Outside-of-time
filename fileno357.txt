Saintly Star's voice stopped abruptly as his life rapidly flowed away.Xu Qing was still worried. After he extracted his bone hand, he wanted to slit open Saintly Star's neck.He wanted to tear Saintly Star's body apart to prevent him from reviving due to some inexplicable method. However, at this moment, a rainbow suddenly erupted from the glazed life lantern in his right hand. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' This rainbow appeared extremely suddenly and directly rose into the air. The Taboo projection of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect seemed to come from the same source, so it didn't stop it. Even the eye of the Seven Blood Eyes' magic treasure couldn't stop it, causing the rainbow to head straight for the sky and explode.It formed a huge vortex.The blood-colored vortex rumbled as it rotated, emitting a soul-stirring and terrifying aura. A furious roar came from the vortex."Who dares to hurt my grandson!!"The magic treasure projection of the Seven Blood Eyes dissipated under this roar. The Taboo projection below also instantly dissipated. The surrounding seal was opened and Xu Qing's figure was revealed.His expression changed as he felt a huge force coming from the life lantern in his hand. It struggled to rush into the vortex in the sky but was held back by Xu Qing. This was an item he had painstakingly obtained after using everything he had. This was his supreme treasure!Since he didn't have enough fingers to hold it tightly, Xu Qing simply bit it and held it tightly.Following the shout from the sky, a hand stretched out from the vortex!This hand was withered and wrinkled. It carried decay and vicissitudes and was incomparably huge, as though it could blot out the sky. The moment it appeared, the sky dimmed and the world lost its color. The entire world seemed to have stopped.A supreme might descended into the world with the appearance of the large hand.Saintly Star's dying body instantly disappeared and appeared in the vortex in the sky.The shadow shuddered and instantly fled.The large hand ignored everything and grabbed at Xu Qing below.Xu Qing's entire body trembled intensely and his blood flowed out from the edges of the life lantern that he was biting. His vision became blurry and his entire body cracked and fractured. More blood flowed out and a sense of death descended on his mind.He couldn't dodge or evade.The vortex hand was an absolute executioner.Cultivation base, schemes, and preparations were useless at this moment. The huge difference in the cultivation base transformed into despair.However, at this moment!From the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden, a sharp cry suddenly rang out. This cry was like the cry of an eagle or a phoenix.It caused the world to change colors and huge cracks to appear in the sky.Amidst the deafening sound, the cracks tore open the blood-colored vortex, stopping the large hand that was stretching out.From the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden, a majestic voice that was like the might of heaven rang out."Nihility cannot enter this emperor's forbidden region. Scram!"As soon as the voice arrived, the blood-colored vortex in the sky was directly torn apart. A muffled groan of pain rang out from the vortex, and three fingers of the withered hand instantly collapsed.Xu Qing's entire body trembled. As the life-and-death crisis dissipated, the rainbow glazed lantern he was biting tightly shook violently.The human-shaped runes that contained the laws of heaven and earth instantly blurred. With cracking sounds, they directly broke off and were completely erased.After losing the runes, the struggle of the life lantern disappeared. Xu Qing could sense that it was truly ownerless now.At the same time, from the vortex in the sky, a mournful shout rang out after the muffled groan. However, it was only a shout. The hand that had lost three fingers retracted unwillingly.However, before it returned, a voice rang out from the vortex."You failed to uphold your duty, so you should be sentenced to death. But if you kill this kid and bring back the life lantern, I'll spare your lives!"Cracks instantly erupted in the sky and swept across the vortex. It was like countless sharp blades were sweeping across, causing the vortex to collapse and dissipate.The instant the world recovered, Xu Qing's breathing became hurried. He put away the wish box on the ground and turned around without any hesitation. He then unleashed his full speed and fled crazily.He didn't have time to think too much at this moment. This was because the instant the vortex collapsed, he sensed three Golden Core auras suddenly descend from afar. They towered into the sky and rapidly approached him with endless madness and anger.The identities of these three Golden Core auras were self-evident. They were none other than Saintly Star's Dao Protectors.As for the terrifying existence in the vortex, it must be the ancestor of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect. Although he was ordered to retreat by the voice from the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden, he was still able to teleport the three Dao Protectors of Saintly Star.He couldn't descend himself but the thought of killing Xu Qing and snatching back the life lantern was intense.Xu Qing had no time to care about the voice from the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden, Saintly Star's life and death, and what he should do next.He was sprinting at full speed and the purple crystal in his body was working with all its power. His eyes revealed ruthlessness as he grabbed the rainbow glazed lantern tightly.As he fled crazily, Xu Qing's eyes showed madness.This time, he had narrowly escaped death and had used everything he had, but his gains were the same.The value of the life lantern was indescribable!"It's worth it!!" Xu Qing gritted his teeth and directly began to refine the rainbow glazed lantern.He didn't have the time to slowly fuse with it. With three Golden Cores chasing after him, he needed to increase his strength and speed up the recovery of his injuries.Hence, he couldn't care less and didn't have the time to examine the life lantern. He could only bet on his senses. The life fires in his body burned and rose.As the flames on his body burned and were released, they enveloped the rainbow glazed lantern. Immediately, the lantern shone brightly. However, Xu Qing didn't encounter any obstacles and directly fused the flames into it, imprinting his mark!This lantern had indeed become an ownerless item following the majestic voice in the Phoenix Forbidden.As it burned, the rainbow light flowed like water and entered Xu Qing's body through the pores on his body. The process wasn't painful but comfortable. After they entered, these streams of light gathered above Xu Qing's dantian and in his sea of consciousness.As they gathered, they formed into a rainbow glazed lantern!The body of the glazed lantern was exquisite and looked luxurious with its rainbow colors. The feeling of time permeated around it, giving off an ancient feeling.Looking from the surface, Xu Qing's black umbrella life lantern wasn't inferior at all.Not only was it exquisite, but the ancient charm was also the same. At this moment, they were standing side by side and reflected each other, emitting an extremely resplendent light.Black and rainbow light spread around them, causing Xu Qing's heavenly palace to be faintly discernible!From the outside, one could see rainbow light erupt from Xu Qing's body and looked like a rainbow Daoist robe. When it enveloped his entire body, two canopies appeared above his head.One was black and emitted endless flames to protect the soul.One was rainbow-colored that covered his entire body and protected his body.One canopy was already extremely rare, and two canopies were majestic and noble!Under the two canopies, although Xu Qing was in a sorry state, a peerless intent spread out from him.At the same time that the rainbow glazed life lantern fused into his body, Xu Qing placed a ball of life fire on it. In an instant, the light of the life fire shook the heavens and the earth.It was as though lightning had exploded in Xu Qing's mind. His cultivation base rose crazily. Under the burning of the two life lanterns in his body, his life fires burned with an unprecedented intensity.It was no longer like a world was burning in him. Instead, it was like a large world had turned into purgatory in his body.With the enhancement of the life lanterns, Xu Qing's combat strength instantly rose from the five fires to the level of six fires!Such combat strength would be under utmost attention among the Foundation Building cultivators even in the Yinghuang Province.This was Saintly Star's strongest state previously. At this moment, it belonged to Xu Qing!As Xu Qing fled crazily in the forbidden region, the anger and killing intent of the three Golden Core Dao Protectors behind him filled the air. On the Wanggu Continent, in the Seven Sects Alliance, a monstrous shout rang out from the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect."How dare a commoner snatch my sect's life lantern!!" This ancient voice belonged to the Soaring Cloud Ancestor.After his shout, a ray of rainbow light that caused the surroundings to tremble and the Forbidden Sea to surge intensely soared into the sky from the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect.One could see an old man in golden robes in the rainbow light.This white-haired old man's energy fluctuations shook the surroundings. With a wave of his hand, streams of sword qi soared into the sky from the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect, transforming into figures that accompanied him in the surroundings. They directly flew toward the Forbidden Sea and rushed aggressively in the direction of the Nanhuang Continent's Seven Blood Eyes. Wherever they passed, the Forbidden Sea would shake intensely, especially because of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor whose realm was the same as Xue Lianzi's, the first stage of the Nihility Realm.Right now, his anger could burn the sea. His entire body emitted endless sword qi, causing the seawater of the Forbidden Sea to collapse. Countless sea beasts trembled and all the nearby races were terrified.Thunder rumbled in the sky and space shattered. This was an almighty going out to sea!At the same time, in the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes, Old Master Seventh was sitting in the pavilion and playing chess with his servant.However, he had been holding the chess piece in his hand for a long time. If the time was counted, it seemed that he had been holding it since the moment Xu Qing and Saintly Star fought.The servant wasn't in a hurry and waited silently.After a long time, Old Master Seventh calmly stood up and spoke."I'm not playing anymore.""I'll go and bring Old Fourth back before playing this piece."As he spoke, Old Master Seventh placed his hands behind his back and took a step into the void, walking toward the Phoenix Forbidden.He had a head full of white hair and eyes that had stars in them.He wore a purple robe and his back was tall like a mountain.He was old but his body was hale and strong.

Chapter 358 He's Here
In the jungle in the Phoenix Forbidden, Xu Qing ran extremely fast, displaying his current limit. However, during this process, he felt an intense piercing pain from everywhere in his body.That was the corrosion of the aura of the Poison Restriction Pill, causing his body to rot inside and out. Although his resistance had increased far beyond what it had been back then, he had stayed in the sealed blood world for too long.Moreover, he had already been seriously injured and weakened then.Fortunately, the integration of the life lantern allowed his body to possess the power to burn five life fires. They were burning unprecedentedly wildly and provided him with astonishing power. In fact, due to the injuries on his body, flames spread out from his body, illuminating the surroundings.From afar, Xu Qing looked like a burning person. As Xu Qing moved forward, the shadow revealed its shadow eyes and looked with a hint of curiosity. When it looked at Xu Qing, a wisp of purple intent rose from Xu Qing's body, forming a suppression that directly landed on the shadow.The shadow immediately let out a blood-curdling screech and hurriedly sent fawning emotions."Even with my injuries, I still have the strength to suppress you to death. Also… cherish the contributions you made," Xu Qing said coldly. The shadow hurriedly expressed its obedience.In reality, when it saw that Xu Qing was so heavily injured earlier, it indeed had a trace of evil intent. However, it was really afraid of Xu Qing, so when Xu Qing was fighting with Saintly Star, it didn't dare to not listen to the instructions. It blocked the magic aperture with all its strength and didn't dare to take it easy.This wasn't its personality. It was all because it was afraid of Xu Qing.This fear was the key to Xu Qing's control over the shadow. Hence, it didn't dare to reveal that trace of evil intent earlier and hid it in curiosity.However, it didn't expect that Xu Qing would still sense it.On the other hand, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was very sensible as he followed Xu Qing with a loyal expression. Xu Qing swept his gaze over and nodded slightly. After that, he controlled the shadow to cover his two life lanterns, preventing the flames from spreading.He then looked behind him with a gloomy expression. He could sense the three figures chasing after him relentlessly. If it wasn't for his six fire speed, he would have been caught up long ago."If I was in a normal state, I could have put up a fight!"Xu Qing endured the waves of dizziness caused by his injuries and weakness. He bit the tip of his tongue and used the pain to perk himself up. He maintained his full speed and ran.He had used all his poison on Saintly Star. In the battle with the other party, Xu Qing had no way to hold back and had to go all out. Only the little black bugs that had fallen asleep after eating the immortal jelly were left. The rest were all in Saintly Star's body.Dawn wasn't far away. As Xu Qing sped, he bit the tip of his tongue again and continued to flee."I have to shake off the three Dao Protectors and leave the Phoenix Forbidden as soon as possible…""I am not sure about what the Seven Blood Eyes' attitude is. I still need to observe.""It might not necessarily be the best choice to leave the Phoenix Forbidden. Surviving here is the same thing." Contemplation appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. Although the price of this matter wasn't small, when he thought of the life lantern he had obtained, determination appeared in his eyes.In this cruel chaotic world, everything needed to be fought for with all their might.At the thought of this, Xu Qing changed his direction and headed straight for the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden. At the same time, he recalled the voice from the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden and the peerless aura that had appeared in his moment of life-and-death crisis earlier."Erasing the mark of the rainbow glazed lantern, was it caused by its aura or was it intentional?" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He didn't think that this matter was just a coincidence. There was a high chance that it was the latter."Why?" Xu Qing couldn't understand but his speed didn't decrease at all. At the same time, he made a grabbing gesture; immediately, a few medicinal herbs at the side flew toward him and he swallowed them.This wasn't the first time he did this. During this escape, he did this whenever he saw useful medicinal herbs. No matter how much effect they had, eating them would provide some help to recover his injuries.However, the herbs hadn't been treated and their medicinal effects couldn't be fully displayed. However, it was still better than nothing. Xu Qing checked his storage bag and saw that there were still some black pills inside."It's better to use these black pills at night when the anomalous substances are dense." Although he was in danger now, Xu Qing took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He calculated the time. If he wanted to completely recover, he would need about five days."Five days… I have to consider the reaction of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect as well. Five days is too long. I have to reach the depths of the Phoenix Forbidden in two days at most and shake off the three people behind me." Xu Qing jumped to a tree crown and sensed the wind."I can only use the Poison Restriction Pill!"Xu Qing sensed his injuries and sighed inwardly. However, his eyes were ruthless as he took out the wish box again and opened it. He borrowed the flow of wind to spread the poisonous pill's aura behind him.The three Dao Protectors of Saintly Star were chasing him with gloomy expressions. They were filled with extreme killing intent toward Xu Qing because the Soaring Cloud Ancestor had already made it very clear that if Xu Qing didn't die, the three of them would die.While they were furious, they were also shocked and in disbelief that Saintly Star had actually lost to Xu Qing and his life lantern had been snatched away.This caused them to be cautious in their pursuit. They even used protective magic artifacts and wind spells."This kid is good at using poison. We have to be careful!""That's right. This kid must have extremely strange methods. We can't be careless." The three of them looked at each other. They didn't split up but chased together.They weren't stupid. Even though Xu Qing was heavily injured, they still had to treat the person who almost killed Saintly Star cautiously. No matter how anxious they were, they couldn't lose their calm.Xu Qing had already sensed this. As he sighed inwardly, his eyes flashed sharply. He had made preparations for both scenarios.If these three people split up, he would lay an ambush and use everything to kill and devour one of them to heal his injuries.If they didn't disperse, the aura of his Poison Restriction Pill would be able to affect all of them more easily. Even if the three of them kept using wind spells to disperse the poison, as long as they were careless, the Poison Restriction Pill's aura would touch them.He lowered his head and looked at his palm that was slowly growing flesh. He crouched down before moving forward again.Just like that, the sky slowly brightened. One of the three Golden Core old men behind Xu Qing glanced around as he chased. His expression suddenly changed. He noticed that a part of another old man's face was rotting."Your face!"That person was stunned. He touched his face before his expression changed. The other two also immediately examined their bodies, but didn't see any signs of poisoning. Only then did they heave a sigh of relief. However, they became even more vigilant."Damn it!" A cold glint flashed in the poisoned cultivator's eyes as he tried to suppress the rotting. However, the effect was minimal. In the end, he chose to do the same thing as Saintly Star; he took out medicinal pills that replenished vitality to neutralize the effect of this poison."We can't continue like this. The poison I was poisoned with is strange and difficult to dispel. We're already so cautious but we still fell for his trick!""If this continues and we continue to be poisoned, we might fail miserably!" The poisoned person quickly spoke. The other two also revealed determination in their eyes."We have to end this quickly!"The three of them looked at each other and gritted their teeth. They instantly used their methods to increase their speed. They were 30% faster than before and transformed into three rainbows that rushed forward even faster.Xu Qing sensed the movements and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.He still had a final trump card, and that was to activate the Poison Restriction Pill, causing the power of the pill to be greatly released, forming a land of death.Xu Qing felt that he might not be able to completely activate the pill, but with the Golden Crow Refines All Life and the power of the life lanterns, even if he could only activate a small portion, the power would definitely be incomparably terrifying.He believed that the three pursuers wouldn't be able to survive in this land of death.'Should I take a gamble…'This trump card was basically mutual destruction. Xu Qing was calculating the probability of him surviving.'The chance is extremely slim…' Xu Qing fell silent and suppressed this thought. He then sensed his injuries. By now, more than half of his hands had healed. Although they were still badly mangled, they had a form now and were much better than before.Xu Qing lowered his head and was about to continue fleeing. However, before he could take a few steps, Xu Qing suddenly stopped in his tracks. His pupils narrowed as he stared ahead.In front of him, a figure walked out of the jungle. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' It was an old man.He wore a purple robe. Although his face was covered in wrinkles, his gaze was very bright and he exuded a scholarly aura.He stood there, in complete contrast with the darkness of the forbidden region's jungle. Distortions appeared outside his body, causing light to be pulled to him.He was fiddling with a black chess piece in his hand. When Xu Qing looked at him, his gaze also swept past Xu Qing's badly mangled body."Put the poison away."Xu Qing lowered his head and stored the wish box. He was still vigilant but he knew that in front of this person, regardless of strength or status, he could only be obedient.The old man in front of him was the peak lord of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes, Old Master Seventh.However, Xu Qing was still vigilant. As a precaution, although he kept the wish box, he left magic power inside so that he could use it immediately when needed.Almost at the same time that Xu Qing put the wish box away, Old Master Seventh's figure blurred. When he appeared, he was already behind Xu Qing. He looked at the jungle. At that moment, the three Golden Core cultivators erupted with full speed and rushed out of the jungle.However, the instant they rushed out, the expressions of the three changed drastically and they came to an abrupt stop. Their breathing became hurried in nervousness and they instinctively retreated.If it was in the Seven Blood Eyes, they wouldn't be like this. This was because they were certain that the Seven Blood Eyes wouldn't dare to make a move in public. However, in this forbidden region, the three of them didn't dare to gamble.The three of them hesitated. The Golden Core cultivator in the middle braced himself and cupped his fists."Greetings, Seventh Peak Lord.""This kid has caused a disaster by injuring the heaven's chosen of my Soaring Cloud Sword Sect and snatching my sect's life lantern. We are under the orders of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor to capture and deal with him. I hope Old Master Seventh can excuse us."Old Master Seventh calmly glanced at the three of them and waved his hand.In an instant, an indescribably vast and astonishing force erupted from the void, directly transforming into a ghastly mouth above the three of them. The instant the expressions of the three Golden Cores changed drastically, this mouth swallowed the three of them!The sound of cruel chewing echoed in the quiet jungle.Xu Qing's body shook. When he saw this scene and looked at Old Master Seventh, he didn't know what to say. Old Master Seventh placed his hands behind his back and walked into the distance, his voice drifting over."What are you waiting for? Let's go back. I still have a game of chess to finish."

Chapter 359 Purple Green's History
Xu Qing dazedly followed Old Master Seventh into the jungle.Old Master Seventh clearly said that he had a game of chess to finish, but he walked relaxedly.However, every step he took covered a very far distance and Xu Qing was also guided by his momentum as he shuttled through the jungle.Xu Qing looked at Old Master Seventh's back view and recalled the scene of the three Golden Core guardians of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect dying with a wave of the other party. He was somewhat in disbelief.As such, he remained silent."You dealt with Grandmaster Bai's matter very well." A moment later, Old Master Seventh's calm voice arrived."It's what I should do," Xu Qing said in a low voice."You've also done well in the matter of the Sea Corpse Race.""It's the capt… It was done by the eldest highness." Xu Qing said after hesitating briefly."The matter with Night Dove was also dealt with nicely.""I was just doing my best." Xu Qing lowered his head."However, you were too rash in dealing with Saintly Star." When Old Master Seventh said this, a ruined city faintly appeared in front. It was the city where Xu Qing and Saintly Star were fighting.Xu Qing didn't speak."You should have called your senior brothers and senior sister, and killed him together. That way, you wouldn't have been so seriously injured." Old Master Seventh's tone was filled with dissatisfaction.Xu Qing hesitated for a while but he felt that what Old Master Seventh said made sense, so he nodded.Seeing that Xu Qing was so obedient, Old Master Seventh was very happy. He turned and looked at Xu Qing, his eyes revealing admiration."Get closer. Aren't you afraid of nothing? Why are you standing so far away."Xu Qing hesitated and slowly walked closer, standing beside Old Master Seventh.Old Master Seventh looked at Xu Qing's height and there was a hint of reminiscence in his eyes. He smiled as he recalled the image of the small and skinny figure in the scavenger campsite who carefully avoided the mud on the ground after changing into new clothes."You have grown."Xu Qing abruptly lifted his head as he had an answer in his mind.Old Master Seventh didn't continue talking about the past and brought Xu Qing into the ruined city. Xu Qing also didn't ask and silently followed.From afar, the old and the young walked in these desolate ruins. The dim yellow sunlight here made them look like they were walking through time."This is an ancient city that has witnessed history and is buried in it."Old Master Seventh's voice echoed in this ancient city, carrying a hint of etherealness.Xu Qing looked at Old Master Seventh and waited for him to continue."Legend has it that this city is the residence of the peerless crown prince of the Purple Green Kingdom, who was known as the number one talent of the human race after the appearance of the god's fragmented face.""It's said that the crown prince was a true peerless talent. He had the bloodline inheritance of the ancient sovereigns and rulers and suppressed everyone in his era.""Some people said that he was born with the fate of the human race. When he was born, an auspicious sign descended from the sky and transformed into nine golden dragons to accompany him for the rest of his life.""Some said that the vast world of the Wanggu Continent created its own savior, gathering the power of the world to bring him to this world.""It's recorded in the history books that the moment he was born, wails rang out from all the forbidden regions in the Wanggu Continent. Strange blood flowed and spread outside the various forbidden regions.""There are also people who said that he survived the opening of the god's eyes five times in his life and obtained the god's blessing.""Even the holy lands were alarmed. They came to receive him several times but he rejected them.""However, such a peerless human ultimately died in battle on the land of the Purple Green Kingdom. It's said that all the people who participated in the killing back then were extremely powerful people."When Xu Qing heard this, his emotions fluctuated. This matter was a little different from what he understood about the Purple Green Kingdom. What he had learned was that the eight families had rebelled and overthrew the royal bloodline. From then on, the Purple Green disappeared and was replaced by Purple Earth's eight families.Noticing Xu Qing's expression, Old Master Seventh smiled."I'm not talking about the Purple Green of the Nanhuang Continent but the Purple Green that was hidden in history - the Purple Green Kingdom that had the ability to truly rule the Wanggu Continent after Mystic Nether. It's a pity that very few people know about it now. All races, including the human race, either of their own initiative or passively, chose to erase the records about this great kingdom and no one mentioned it again.""As for the Purple Earth's eight races, what they overthrew was only a small country that was formed by the insignificant remnants of Purple Green."Xu Qing drew in a deep breath."The peerless crown prince of the Purple Green Kingdom died in battle in the Nanhuang Continent. Countless years later, there was a small city where he died. However, eleven years ago, the god opened His eyes and the entire city disappeared.""Some say it's his curse."Xu Qing remained silent.Not long later, they arrived in front of the Daoist temple amidst the ruins. This place was a mess and the ground was covered in traces of intense battle. After looking at this place, Xu Qing looked at Old Master Seventh."Didn't someone say that you lack divine arts? Go and comprehend it. Hurry up, I still have to go back and play chess." Old Master Seventh knocked Xu Qing's head.Xu Qing's heart skipped a beat. This sentence was said by Saintly Star during the battle with him.Xu Qing glanced at Old Master Seventh and nodded as he walked into the Daoist temple. He then sat down cross-legged and silently stared at the statue.A long time later, he stood up and looked at Old Master Seventh outside."What's wrong?" Old Master Seventh asked."It can't be comprehended during the day and needs moonlight." Xu Qing hesitated for a moment before answering honestly.Old Master Seventh mumbled something that Xu Qing couldn't hear clearly. After that, he waved his hand and clouds instantly filled the sky of the Dao Temple. In an instant, black clouds lingered, blocking out the sunlight and covering the surroundings, causing the area with the Dao Temple as the center to turn pitch-black.In this pitch-black darkness, a mirror appeared in the black clouds. There was actually moonlight in this mirror. As the mirror rotated, a wisp of moonlight landed, illuminating the Daoist temple and the statue.At the next instant, saber shadows formed around the statue.Xu Qing's thoughts churned. He looked at Old Master Seventh and took a long breath.He had seen Lord Sixth make a move before, but he felt that Lord Sixth definitely couldn't create this scene that seemed to be switching the sun and moon with a wave of the hand.This reminded Xu Qing of the tradition of the Seventh Peak.'Old Master Seventh is definitely not a Nascent Soul cultivator!' Xu Qing knew that this was a precious opportunity. He retracted his thoughts and stared at the saber shadows around the statue and gradually, a purple illusory heavenly saber appeared above his head.He began to comprehend.As he comprehended, Old Master Seventh stood outside the Dao Temple and looked at the surrounding battlefield while muttering."He indeed has few divine arts and spells… but has a lot of miscellaneous stuff.""Although his battle tactics are still immature, it's already quite good considering his age."Just like that, time flowed by.On the Forbidden Sea, sword light towered into the sky.Streams of sword qi whistled toward the Seven Blood Eyes. The Soaring Cloud Ancestor's anger and killing intent filled the air. The Soaring Cloud Sword Sect disciples behind him were also following with a ferocious aura.Within the Phoenix Forbidden, it was completely peaceful.Night fell.Xu Qing's comprehension continued. The moonlight released by Old Master Seventh was even brighter at night, causing the appearance of saber shadows to be much more frequent than before. Moreover, they were much clearer in Xu Qing's eyes.His comprehension speed was clearly astonishing. The purple saber shadow above his head rapidly condensed, from 10% to 50%, 60%, 70%…When the night passed and morning arrived, Xu Qing's entire body trembled. A sharp aura erupted from his body and the purple saber shadow above his head reached perfection.It was no longer illusory but was like a true heavenly saber, emitting a terrifying sharpness. The moonlight formed by Old Master Seventh's wave of his hand clearly possessed the power to heal; Xu Qing had completely recovered over this period of time.His missing fingers had grown back and his aura reached an unprecedented peak.He stood up. The combat strength of the six fires created a majestic storm in the surroundings.Old Master Seventh took a look and his eyes were filled with satisfaction as he slowly spoke."Even outsiders know, you don't have to hide in front of me anymore."Xu Qing didn't speak. After a moment of silence, a beam of black light and a rainbow light spread out from the top of his head.The black light transformed into flames, forming a black canopy that emitted black flames.The rainbow light flowed out and the sound of wind rang out in the surroundings, transforming into a rainbow canopy that shone with resplendent light.Two canopies appeared.At the same time, they illuminated the surroundings.Even though there was the morning light, Xu Qing's body shone brightly."Let's go. Calculating the time, the guests should be here soon." Old Master Seventh smiled faintly and flicked his sleeve. Immediately, the surrounding space changed. It was as though clouds were shuttling through, and the shadow of the world was swaying inside.Xu Qing looked at these and once again sensed the power of Old Master Seventh's cultivation. As his breathing hastened, his surroundings returned to normal. He was no longer in the Phoenix Forbidden ruins but in the pavilion at the top of the Seventh Peak.The sea breeze blew over, bringing with it the familiar humidity.The hustle and bustle from the main city also spread in the wind, as though countless people were whispering. This scene caused Xu Qing to feel a little dazed, especially since in front of him, other than Old Master Seventh, there was a familiar figure.The other party wore a gray robe and looked to be middle-aged. He had a smile on his face as he stood up from beside a chessboard.Xu Qing recognized this person. He was the person who had given him the token at the scavenger campsite back then."Old Master Seventh." The gray-clothed servant first bowed to Old Master Seventh before nodding at Xu Qing."Are the guests here?" Old Master Seventh's gaze landed on the chessboard."They are almost here," the servant said respectfully."Mm, bring the kid to take a bath first. He has gotten quite dirty." Old Master Seventh flicked his sleeve and walked out of the pavilion.The word 'kid' caused Xu Qing to retract his gaze. The scene in front of him also made the guess in his mind increasingly clear."Kid, I'll take you to the bath. Next is not only your major event but also Old Master Seventh's major event. It's also the Seven Blood Eyes' major event," the servant said meaningfully and handed Xu Qing a jade slip."After bathing, walk out of the hall and step onto the mountain stairs. You can then look at this jade slip."Xu Qing took the jade slip and fell into deep thought. He didn't ask further and politely bowed before leaving with the servant. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' After thoroughly washing his entire body, he was given a new Daoist robe. There were also some maids who arrived and waved some special incense around him.Xu Qing wasn't used to it but he didn't refuse.When some maidservants behind him tied his hair up, the captain stuck his head out of the door and winked at Xu Qing.A servant walked over with a purple Daoist crown.This crown flowed with light and was extremely exquisite. It emitted a terrifying pressure and there was a faint shadow of a mutated beast lingering inside. Upon closer inspection, this beast had the body of a nine-headed snake. It was a strange existence that appeared during the end of the competition in the merfolk islands.After looking at it for a long time, one would feel as though they could hear the roars of ferocious beasts. It was mystical and extraordinary!"Damn, this is the Purple Heaven Infinite Crown that has half of a Nascent Soul's soul sealed inside. The old man is biased. I wanted this thing for a long time but he didn't give it to me!" While the captain's eyes were widening brightly, the servant placed the crown on Xu Qing's head.At that moment, Xu Qing was wearing a purple gold-patterned robe and the Purple Heaven Infinite Crown. There was a faint canopy above his head. Coupled with his appearance, he gave off an extraordinary and peerless feeling.The surrounding maids all revealed strange gazes.Just as the captain was about to speak, a solemn voice rang out from the outside."The Dao is originally invisible, formless, and indescribable. It can't be understood without the scriptures. The Dao is deep and profound. It cannot be understood without a teacher.""Today, my Seventh Peak will impart the Dao and teachings to Xu Qing, so we are here to report to Ancestor!"The solemn voice spread through the sky.

Chapter 360 Master Acknowledging Ceremony
This voice was spoken with a tone that was different from usual.It was like an ode that spread through the world!The words were ancient and the content was elegant.Like reporting to heaven and earth!Even the captain who was beside the door had an unprecedented solemn expression. He no longer winked at Xu Qing and walked out.Today, the captain was no longer wearing a gray Daoist robe but a purple Daoist robe with golden patterns that was exactly the same as Xu Qing's.Their Daoist robes looked similar to the disciples of the Seventh Peak at first glance, but in reality, there was a huge difference.The captain stood at the door. His gaze became deep as he stared at Xu Qing and calmly spoke."Xu Qing, follow me. From now on, I'll be your protector."The captain had never spoken like this before. Not only was his expression solemn, but his words were also the same. As he spoke, he cast a deep glance at Xu Qing. He cupped his fists and stacked his thumbs, raising them to the level of his brows. He then bent down deeply and performed an extremely formal Dao salute.A sense of seriousness filled the atmosphere. Xu Qing could sense that what he was going to participate in next was an extremely solemn ceremony. He tidied his clothes and returned the greeting to the captain before walking to the entrance of the hall.The moment he stepped out, Xu Qing's mind shook.The hall he was in was located near the top of the Seventh Peak. In front of him was a huge octagonal Dao altar made of limestone that emitted spiritual charm. There was a statue enshrined on it.This statue was of a middle-aged man. He had his hands behind his back and was looking into the distance.His face couldn't be seen clearly. One could only see that he was wearing an ancient emperor robe and blue emperor crown. There were nine dazzling canopies above him and dragon qi enveloped his body. He looked down on the world from high above and his aura devoured mountains and rivers.Just the statue alone had such an earth-shattering aura, causing Xu Qing's pupils to narrow.However, he quickly retracted his thoughts and looked around the Dao altar.Around the altar, Xu Qing saw at least a thousand Seven Blood Eyes disciples. There were men and women, old and young among these disciples. All of them wore serious expressions and wore purple Daoist robes that seemed to have not been used for a long time.As for the front of the Dao altar, there was a white stone staircase with dragon patterns. There were a total of 90 steps. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' Above the steps was a large hall that emitted a purple light and a vast intent. That place… was the tallest hall of the Seventh Peak.Clouds and mist were lingering above the hall. A huge black pterosaur was flying in the clouds. Bolts of lightning followed its movements and rumbled in all directions.In the clouds, there were six tall figures standing like Buddhist statues, staring at the ground.Among these six people, Xu Qing saw the peak lords, including Lord Sixth.They were all looking at Xu Qing. There was even encouragement in Lord Sixth's eyes.Xu Qing was somewhat nervous at this sight. He looked up again and saw a blood-colored figure standing like a god above the clouds. He was extremely tall and seemed to be able to support the world.He was the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor, Xue Lianzi.They were all here to witness the ceremony!"Disciple of the Seventh Peak, Xu Qing. This statue is of Ancient Sovereign Mystic Nether, the source of my Seventh Peak's teachings.""Ancient Sovereign Mystic Nether is the last sovereign of the human race to suppress Wanggu. Bow to it!"The captain stood beside Xu Qing and stared straight ahead at the statue on the Dao altar. He spoke solemnly and his voice spread in all directions.Xu Qing lowered his head, cupped his fists, and bowed deeply to the statue of the ancient sovereign. The moment he raised his head, the captain and all the Seventh Peak's disciples around the Dao altar lowered their heads and bowed in unison to the statue of the ancient sovereign.Their movements were uniform and their auras were astonishing.Xu Qing's expression became even more solemn. He followed the captain and walked forward under the gazes of the surrounding Seventh Peak's disciples.At this moment, the captain's voice rang out."Our cultivation goes against heaven. The Wanggu Great World has nine heavens and ten lands, so our Seventh Peak set up ninety steps. Step on the stairs and prove that you can walk past the nine heavens and tread on ten lands!""Xu Qing, go up the stairs!"The captain's voice resonated like a dragon's roar.Xu Qing solemnly lifted his foot and stepped onto the first step.The instant he landed, a bell chime rang out in the Seventh Peak.Dong!The bell rang heavily. As the sound rang out, the color of the sky changed and the wind and clouds churned.Xu Qing's mind focused and a jade slip flew out from his pocket. It was given by the servant.At this moment, this jade slip emitted a resplendent light and floated in front of him. It followed him like a guiding light.Under the light of the jade slip, a scene that was recorded by someone was reflected in Xu Qing's mind.The scene was of the Beastfight Arena in a scavenger campsite. In it, a youth in a leather coat with a dirty face was dragging a large python.Sitting at the side were two figures invisible to outsiders. One was Old Master Seventh and the other was the servant. They were looking at Xu Qing. Old Master Seventh's voice carried some interest as it traveled softly."This youth is pretty interesting."Xu Qing's eyes widened. The youth in the Beastfight Arena was naturally him. At this moment, Xu Qing finally understood why he came to the Seven Blood Eyes later.This was a scene caused by fate.As Xu Qing's heart trembled, he unknowingly crossed eight steps and arrived at the ninth step. The bell of the Seventh Peak rang out a second time.The jade slip in front of Xu Qing shone as another scene appeared in Xu Qing's mind.In the scene, a youth was squatting in a dark corner of an alley. When a tall and skinny scavenger passed by, the youth leaped up and directly covered the scavenger's mouth from behind and slit his neck.On the roof at the side, Old Master Seventh sat there with admiration in his eyes."Interesting little fellow."Xu Qing's breathing became slightly rough. He understood, completely understood. When the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth bell chimes rang out one after another, Xu Qing had already walked very far away.The bell chimes grew louder and more majestic. Just like the scenes in his mind, each of them caused increasingly large waves in his mind.The third scene was him wearing new clothes and carefully avoiding the mud. Old Master Seventh was curious why he had changed his clothes.In the fourth scene, he killed Fat Mountain and staggered away under the moonlight after being poisoned. Old Master Seventh, who was watching from a roof, laughed.The fifth scene showed Grandmaster Bai. Old Master Seventh said something before he left Grandmaster Bai's tent."Grandmaster Bai, if you really think that that kid is a promising talent, then impart some knowledge to him. Let him have a chance to become a scholar with cultivation in the Seven Blood Eyes."The sixth scene was after Captain Lei, Grandmaster Bai, and the little girl left one after another. Xu Qing was alone in the house, silently merging into the darkness. The moment he was enveloped by loneliness, Old Master Seventh spoke softly outside the door of his house."Give him a white token."Xu Qing's body trembled. He had many guesses before but now that he understood the reason, he lifted his head and looked at the top of the mountain. The seventh bell chime rang out.This was followed by the eighth and ninth chimes.As the bell rang, the jade slip continued to shine. Xu Qing saw the seventh scene.That was when he had just arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes. In the middle of the night, when the magic boat was swaying, he picked up the wine flask and toasted his parents, Captain Lei, and his birthday.The eighth scene was Xu Qing being chased in the Sea Corpse Race.The ninth scene was the battle in front of the temple.An indescribable emotion fluctuated in Xu Qing's heart. As the light from the jade slip dimmed, it returned to his arms. Xu Qing took the last 90th step.He saw the vast purple hall and Old Master Seventh, who was sitting there and watching him.Beside Old Master Seventh were the second highness and third highness.Today, Old Master Seventh's clothes were much more grand than before. He wore a purple robe, his hair was tied up, and he wore an azure crown with nine pythons carved on it. His gaze was like lightning and he gave off a feeling of vastness."Xu Qing." The person who spoke wasn't Old Master Seventh but the captain who had followed Xu Qing all the way here."You have proved that you can walk through the nine heavens and tread the ten lands. Now, bow three times to heaven and earth."When the captain's voice rang out, Xu Qing stood on the 90th step, looking at the sky and land. He bowed three times!The moment he rose, the captain and the surrounding disciples bowed three times to the world!All of these scenes were filled with solemnity. Every ritual carried deep meaning. In the chaotic world of cultivation, everything could be simplified and benefits were paramount. However, paying respects to the ancestors and the taking of disciples couldn't be done like this. The ritual was important.​ "The Dao is originally invisible. It can't be understood without the scriptures and a teacher.""Ancient Sovereign Mystic Nether started a great undertaking, so our human race needs to bow once to him.""Heaven and earth bear the weight of history, so our human race needs to bow three times.""However, the high and mighty ancient sovereign hasn't graced you. The sea of bitterness of all living beings in the world didn't spare you. Only a teacher can take you to the sky and tread on the ground. He shall grace you in this life and help you to cross into the next. He will do his best to walk the Great Dao together with you, so you need to bow nine times!"The captain's voice resounded through the sky and shook the world.Xu Qing turned and stared at Old Master Seventh's figure in the hall. He bowed nine times!He bowed once to the ancient king, three times to heaven and earth, and nine times to his master.Only the captain could bow nine times with Xu Qing. The cultivators around the Dao altar could only lower their heads solemnly. They didn't have the qualifications to bow with Xu Qing.After the ninth bow, Xu Qing stepped forward. The captain took out a purple teacup and passed it to Xu Qing.Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and stepped into the purple hall."Thought tea!"Xu Qing took three steps forward. He then lifted the teacup high in the air.Almost at the instant he lifted the teacup, wind and clouds suddenly surged in the sky outside. One could feel the monstrous sword qi in the distance, bringing with it the color of blood. It was like a large blood-colored hand that wanted to cover the sky as it approached the Seven Blood Eyes.The Soaring Cloud Sword Sect had arrived!A voice that contained endless killing intent spread to every inch of the Seven Blood Eyes sect from the sea of sword qi."Xue Lianzi, hand over that bastard Xu Qing!"

Chapter 361 If You Don’t Leave, I Won’t Abandon You
Killing intent overflowed into the sky outside the Seven Blood Eyes.In the Seven Blood Eyes' Seventh Peak, the solemnity was still there. The expressions of the various peak lords in the sky were calm.Xu Qing heard the furious roar from outside the array formation. He didn't turn his head but continued to lower his head and raise the teacup in his hand high.Old Master Seventh, who was sitting upright, also didn't look at the outside world. It was as though he didn't care about everything outside. The only thing he cared about was this disciple who was halfway through the apprenticeship ceremony.He waved his hand; immediately, the teacup Xu Qing was holding high flew out and headed toward him. When it reached his hand, he didn't drink it but placed it on the table at the side.This tea was called thought tea and wasn't for drinking.Although the second highness and third highness had solemn expressions, the third highness secretly winked at Xu Qing and greeted him. There seemed to be a smile in his eyes."Past tea!"The captain spoke as he handed Xu Qing a second cup of tea. Xu Qing took another three steps forward and raised the teacup high. A shocking boom rang out from outside the Seven Blood Eyes array formation.The cultivators of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect didn't stop at all after approaching the Seven Blood Eyes. One after another, sword qi erupted even more intensely, transforming into a dazzling light that blasted toward the Seven Blood Eyes.The Seven Blood Eyes' array formation defense was activated, blocking the countless sword qi. In an instant, the world shook as rumbling sounds reverberated in the seven mountains.The Seven Blood Eyes' array formation was clearly different from before. At this moment, it seemed to have completely expelled the authority of the Seven Sects Alliance and listed the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect as an enemy.The peak lords of the Seven Blood Eyes still didn't care. Their expressions caused the disciples of the various peaks to calm down and continue to watch the ceremony in the Seventh Peak.In the Seventh Peak's purple hall, Old Master Seventh ignored the outside world and waved his hand to take the second cup of tea.This second cup of tea was called past tea. One sip indicated that the master had agreed to take the person in as a disciple. Old Master Seventh picked it up and took a sip before placing it on the table."Faith tea!" The captain spoke as he passed Xu Qing the third cup of tea.Xu Qing took a deep breath and took three more steps. This time, he directly arrived in front of Old Master Seventh. He knelt down and raised the teacup high.At that moment, the rumbling sounds from the outside world became even more intense. This lasted until a loud bang that was like heavenly lightning erupted.It was a blood-colored sword qi that was a thousand feet long. When the sword landed on the Seven Blood Eyes' protective array formation, the array formation was unable to withstand it and directly collapsed. As it shattered into pieces, the thousand-foot-long sword qi transformed into a golden-robed old man.The old man took a step forward and appeared in the air above the Seven Blood Eyes. Sword lights whistled and arrived behind him, transforming into disciples of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect.Every one of them was filled with killing intent.All of them were filled with fierce momentum."Xue Lianzi, you…" The person who slashed open the array formation was none other than the Soaring Cloud Ancestor. After he arrived, he was just about to speak when he swept his divine sense over and noticed the scene on the top of the Seventh Peak. He saw Xu Qing kneeling there and raising a teacup high. He also saw Old Master Seventh who accepted Xu Qing's teacup.He had lived for so many years and as an ancestor of a sect, how could he not know the meaning of this scene?"He is actually going through a master acknowledging ceremony?" The killing intent in the Soaring Cloud Ancestor's eyes was intense and his entire body emitted endless coldness. His gaze looked at everything as though he was looking at the dead."The bastard who injured my grandson and snatched my sect's life lantern is actually acknowledging a master. Xue Lianzi, I am very curious. Where did you get the guts to do this?!""Soaring Cloud, let's talk after my son-in-law is done taking in the disciple." Xue Lianzi said calmly with a spurious smile. The expressions of the six peak lords in the clouds were calm without any panic.This scene caused Soaring Cloud's eyes to narrow slightly and his heart to sink. The feeling the Seven Blood Eyes gave him today was very different from what he remembered!In the Seventh Peak's purple hall, even though the pressure from the outside world was earth-shattering, Old Master Seventh still didn't take a look. After accepting Xu Qing's teacup, he looked at Xu Qing. Under the gazes of everyone from the Seven Blood Eyes and the killing intent from the outside world, he slowly spoke."Kid, ritual is only a ritual. I only want to ask your heart. Are you sincerely willing to become my disciple?"Xu Qing lifted his head and looked into Old Master Seventh's eyes as he spoke softly."Master."Old Master Seventh laughed loudly."Alright, my disciple. If you don't leave, I won't abandon you!" As he spoke, he dipped the thumb and index finger of his right hand into the tea and flicked it lightly at Xu Qing's body. As the tea splattered, the apprenticeship ceremony was completed!The bell rang again. This time, it wasn't just the bell of the Seventh Peak but the bells on all seven peaks rang out at the same time. The sound seemed to shake everything."Today, I have accepted my fourth disciple. It's a joyous occasion, but you actually dared to interrupt and demand my disciple to be handed over?"When the Soaring Cloud Ancestor heard Old Master Seventh, he laughed from extreme anger. There was a middle-aged cultivator beside him. This person looked a little similar to Saintly Star. At this moment, his expression was ugly as he took a step forward.His speed was so fast that he directly transformed into a blood sword that headed straight for the Seventh Peak's purple hall. A Nascent Soul cultivation fluctuation erupted from his body, shaking the surroundings. The strength of his energy fluctuation far surpassed that of ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators, and seemed to be infinitely close to the peak of the Nascent Soul realm.In an instant, the blood sword he transformed into arrived at the Seventh Peak and in front of the purple hall. Just as he was about to rush in, Old Master Seventh laughed and stood up, walking toward the outside world. He didn't care about the blood sword that was charging over and only waved his hand.At the next instant, the blood sword suddenly trembled and collapsed into pieces. A mournful cry rang out.One could see the figure of the Nascent Soul middle-aged man who had transformed into the blood sword tumbling back like a kite with a broken string. 90% of his body collapsed and exploded uncontrollably, and he was on the verge of death.This explosion was irreversible. Almost at the instant he screamed, his body collapsed and turned into blood mist that lingered in the air.Only his Nascent Soul flew out. It looked at Old Master Seventh who walked out of the purple hall with panic and horror.This middle-aged man from the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect, whose body had collapsed with a wave of Old Master Seventh's hand and only his Nascent Soul was left, had an extremely high status in the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect. He was a great elder of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect.He was also the only son of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor and the father of Saintly Star. Hence, he had attacked in anger earlier.However, at this moment, he was in an extremely miserable state. Even his Nascent Soul was dim, on the verge of collapsing.The shock in his heart was indescribable. He knew his strength but the other party was able to destroy his body with a wave of his hand. This cultivation base… caused his mind to shake violently. He even had a strong feeling that the other party didn't really want to kill; otherwise, his Nascent Soul would definitely not be able to escape. "You're not a Nascent Soul cultivator, you're a Spirit Repository!!" Saintly Star's father exclaimed in disbelief. As he retreated, the minds of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect's disciples trembled and their expressions changed drastically.Only the Soaring Cloud Ancestor's expression didn't change much. He only took a deep look at Old Master Seventh. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' "You hid it so deeply that even this old man couldn't tell earlier. Your cultivation isn't an ordinary Spirit Repository either. You should have opened three secret repositories.""However, just this is not enough. Xue Lianzi, what other methods do you have? You can take them out now."Old Master Seventh smiled and didn't speak. After he walked out, he stood outside the purple hall and looked at Xue Lianzi in the sky.Xue Lianzi also glanced at Old Master Seventh with admiration in his eyes. After that, he looked at the Soaring Cloud Ancestor and a ferocious glint flashed in his eyes."Let's fight first!"As he spoke, Xue Lianzi's entire body swayed and streams of light erupted from his eyes, transforming into blood threads that headed straight for the Soaring Cloud Ancestor.The Soaring Cloud Ancestor let out a cold snort. With a wave of his hand, the sword qi in the surroundings overflowed into the sky and attacked the approaching Xue Lianzi. In an instant, the two of them exchanged blows, causing cracks and destruction in the surroundings. They headed straight for the sky. Booming sounds spread in all directions like thunder.The pterosaur in the clouds let out a low roar at the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect disciples. The six peak lords of the Seven Blood Eyes also displayed their cultivation bases, causing the world to tremble with their auras.Moreover, Old Master Seventh was standing at the top of the Seventh Peak with his hands behind his back. All of this caused the cultivators of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect, who had arrived aggressively, to be in a dilemma.The few Nascent Soul cultivators among them felt their scalps tingle as they looked at Old Master Seventh with extreme fear.The difference between a Nascent Soul cultivator and a Spirit Repository was like the difference between one life fire and six life fires. If Old Master Seventh wanted to, he could instantly kill all of them. Not a single one of them could escape.This difference caused the disciples of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect to be extremely nervous. The Soaring Cloud Sword Sect also had a Spirit Repository, but that was their sect master. With the ancestor going out, the sect master had to stay behind to guard the sect.They never expected that not only did the Seven Blood Eyes have a Nihility Realm ancestor, but there was also someone at the Spirit Repository Realm which was below the Nihility Realm and above the Nascent Soul Realm!Not only were the disciples of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect shocked, but even the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples were shocked. However, after thinking of the tradition of the Seventh Peak, they suddenly felt that there was nothing strange about this.The other peak lords in the clouds clearly knew about it long ago and weren't surprised at all. As for the disciples around the Seventh Peak's Dao Altar as well as Xu Qing and the highnesses, they looked at each other."I suspect that the old man is still hiding," said Third Senior Brother in a low voice."Old third, be more confident. It's certain." The captain smiled.Xu Qing glanced at the captain and Third Senior Brother but didn't speak. As for Second Senior Sister, she was holding a jade slip and continuously transmitting her voice. It was as though she wasn't interested in everything outside."Junior Brother, I knew it. When I first saw you back then, I felt that we were fated. I went back and analyzed that you would be my junior brother." Third Senior Brother smiled and looked at Xu Qing."However, I didn't expect you to actually kill Saintly Star. You have to know that when the Seven Sects Alliance did the challenges, the eldest highnesses of the other peaks might not have given their all, but the First Peak went all out."

Chapter 362 Birth Of A Taboo!
"This is also the reason why I sent my beloved merfolk girlfriends to meet their ancestors in front of you back then," Third Senior Brother said with a smile.The captain watched this with a spurious smile. He knew that Third wasn't the kind of person who liked to say useless things. This was clearly to ease his relationship with Xu Qing.Xu Qing glanced at his third senior brother. The scene of the other party gently crushing the head of the merfolk woman at the harbor surfaced in his mind. At that time, he felt that this third senior brother was dangerous. Now that he looked at him again, the sense of danger was still the same. 'However, in a life-and-death battle, I should be able to survive.' Xu Qing weighed the pros and cons in his mind and cupped his fists."A meeting gift." Third Senior Brother was still smiling. He took out a bundle of spirit stone tickets and stuffed them into Xu Qing's hands. After that, he spoke softly."Back then outside the Sea Lizard Island, you weren't my junior brother yet, so I chased after you for fun. Junior Brother, don't mind it. Take it as me owing you a favor."Xu Qing glanced at his third senior brother.Back then, when he was fleeing outside the Sea Lizard Island, he was targeted and chased by many auras. Although he didn't see who those people were from the start to the end, he vaguely felt that his third senior brother's attitude later on wasn't right and he had some doubts.Right now, the other party directly pointed it out and Xu Qing was a little surprised. He took the spirit tickets and glanced at them. They amounted to a total of 500,000 spirit stones which was enough sincerity. Hence, he nodded and kept them.Seeing Xu Qing put away the spirit tickets, Third Senior Brother heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. He cherished the atmosphere of the Seventh Peak very much. Most importantly, he felt that this little junior brother was the kind of person who if you didn't kill him in one try would haunt you for the rest of his life.He didn't want to provoke such a person. He was about to continue speaking.However, at this moment, a deafening roar rang out from the sky, causing the earth to shake. Fish-scale-shaped energy fluctuations spread in all directions in the sky."Xue Lianzi, you're courting death!"Everyone immediately looked up.Sword qi filled the sky, as though they wanted to split the sky. They carried such destructive power that Xu Qing felt a piercing pain in his eyes when he looked at them, especially when he saw a familiar withered hand in the sky.This hand was like the hand of a god, containing terrifying divinity. Its energy fluctuations seemed to change the laws, causing blurry shadows to appear in the surroundings. They were like illusory sages, manifesting in this withered hand and augmenting it.It seemed to be able to pluck the stars and destroy the world as it grabbed the void.The void shattered layer by layer and the sky transformed into a sea of blood. Accompanied by the muttering sounds of blurry shadows, a suppressive force appeared.Xu Qing's pupils constricted. Xue Lianzi transformed into countless blood threads. They were equally astonishing and emitted peerless evil. He was like an undying ferocious demon. Even if the sages descended and the sea of swords suppressed him, they were still helpless against his savageness.As a sinister laugh echoed, countless blood threads that were like sinister blood snakes that could devour mountains and rivers appeared. Wherever they passed, the sword qi would collapse and the sword shadows would be destroyed. Finally, they formed a vicious dragon snake head that slammed fiercely toward the withered hand.The huge collision shook the space and sky. The withered hand collapsed and the Soaring Cloud Ancestor retreated. The head formed by countless blood threads also retreated and transformed into Xue Lianzi's figure. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he laughed loudly."Daoist Soaring Cloud, you're a thousand years older than me, but you're nothing much.""The cultivators of the lower sects will eventually be suppressed. Xue Lianzi, this old man will give you one last chance. Hand over Xu Qing and return the life lantern and follow the decree of the Seven Sects Alliance. Your Seven Blood Eyes can be like before and the Seven Sects Alliance won't interfere too much!"A cold glint filled the eyes of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor. He lifted his right hand and performed a series of hand seals, pointing forward. Immediately, the sea of blood in the sky rumbled and a blurry shadow of a blood tree was vaguely formed.This was the Taboo magic treasure of the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect. Although it wasn't in its true form, with the authority of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor, the projection power he used was equally astonishing. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' "Not too much interference?" Xue Lianzi laughed loudly."For thousands of years, 60% of our sect's annual profits have been handed over to the Alliance. Every batch of heaven's chosen disciples has to be sent to you. They will either have to submit to you or be sent to dangerous places to die.""My sect's cultivation arts are all secondary cultivation arts of your sects and contain fatal flaws. If we obtain a new cultivation art, you will take it away!""The authority of your alliance in my sect's array formation surpasses ours. If you are unhappy with any of my sect's peak lords, they will immediately be rotated and their survival is uncertain."As Xue Lianzi spoke, the disciples of the seven mountain peaks fell silent. All of them were breathing heavily as a sharp glint appeared in their eyes.The Soaring Cloud Ancestor frowned."When drinking water, don't forget those who dug the well. At the early stage of the Seven Blood Eyes, the seven sects of the alliance contributed resources and disciples to build it. Only then did your Seven Blood Eyes develop further. Now that your wings have grown, you want to be ungrateful?!"Xue Lianzi laughed again. There was a tone of absurdity in his laughter."There is gratitude, you are right in that!""The battle of the Corpse Forbidden 3,000 years ago, the battle of the Soul Stream 2,700 years ago, the battle with the Cloud Race 2,000 years ago, the battle with the Heart Soul Race 1,700 years ago… So far, my Seven Blood Eyes has fought for your Seven Sects Alliance more than 600 times!""There are countless casualties and bones of our sect spread all over the world!""The burial of the dead disciples and the medicinal pills for the injured disciples, did your Seven Sects Alliance contribute even the slightest in this? Every time my sect is about to prosper, it will decline in some war and the gains from the war are extremely meager!""In the past few thousand years, our sect has faced danger of extermination 79 times. Has your Seven Sects Alliance helped us even once? Our sect's ancestors have asked for help many times. In fact, the third generation ancestor even knelt in front of the alliance and begged for help. Have you guys bothered once?""Every time, it's the ancestors of my Seven Blood Eyes who have worked diligently and painstakingly to slowly recover their wounds. Once the sect improves slightly, your alliance will rotate them just by sending a decree!""Could it be that my Seven Blood Eyes' disciples aren't lives and have to die for you just so that you guys can sit back and enjoy the fruits of our labor? Soaring Cloud, I, Xue Lianzi, want to ask your Seven Sects Alliance and this world.""Has my Seven Blood Eyes not paid this gratitude enough?!""Has my Seven Blood Eyes not settled this gratitude?!""By relying on the initial kindness, you continue to squeeze us dry and act like that's what we should do! You guys place yourselves high and above. If my Seven Blood Eyes doesn't listen to your orders and fight to the death for you, we'll be forgetting your gratitude. If we don't listen to your orders and hand over the benefits, we'll be ungrateful!""Could it be that this gratitude wants my Seven Blood Eyes to be slaves for generations and repay it till we perish?!"Xue Lianzi's voice was like the sounds of a large bell, echoing through the world, causing the seven mountain peaks of the Seven Blood Eyes to buzz and tremble.The Soaring Cloud Ancestor's expression was cold. It wasn't that he didn't understand the matter of the Seven Blood Eyes, but benefits determined his stand. Hence, he calmly spoke."There's no need to say more. People who forget gratitude will always have many excuses."Xue Lianzi laughed loudly."What a good upper sect. What a good moral blackmail. What a good 'when drinking water, don't forget those who dug the well'!!""Since that's the case, today… my Seven Blood Eyes will become an upper sect!"The eyes of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor instantly revealed a sharp glint."Your sect is not worthy.""Let's see if it is worthy or not." Xue Lianzi's eyes revealed an intense light in the air. He lifted his right hand and pointed at the sky."Sea Corpse Ancestral Land, activate the array formation!"As soon as Xue Lianzi finished speaking, the weather changed and the world rumbled.Far away from here, after crossing Starfish Island, the merfolk islands, the many sub islands of the Sea Corpse Race, there was the ancestral land of the Sea Corpse Race. At this moment, in the ancestral land, the land quaked intensely.Here, half of the area had already been taken down by the Seven Blood Eyes.Here, there was the Seven Blood Eyes' army that had yet to retreat.Here, the Seven Blood Eyes had already finished setting up the huge teleportation array that was prepared to move two Sea Corpse Race's ancestral corpse statues.The two statues that had long been moved here stood there with astonishing auras. The teleportation arrays in the air and on the ground shone with boundless light. The clouds seemed to be pushed aside by an invisible hand and the sky rumbled as the light shone everywhere.The teleportation formation in the sky was activated and emitted loud rumbling sounds.The two ancestral corpse statues were not teleported away, but… something had teleported over from the sky.They were five beams of light.The lights were extremely dazzling. However, as they descended, they quickly became clear, causing the hearts of all the cultivators who were paying attention in the Sea Corpse Race's ancestral land to tremble violently. Their expressions were filled with horror and disbelief.This was because what were in the five beams of light were… five unfamiliar ancestral corpse statues!These five statues weren't from the Sea Corpse Race's nine ancestral corpse statues!Every one of them carried vast ancientness and vicissitudes of time. They were covered in dry cracks and looked like ordinary stone material. Only when they landed on the land of the Sea Corpse Race did they erupt with resplendent light.This was the peculiarity of the Sea Corpse Race's ancestral corpse statues. Only in this land could they show their vast might.As the five statues landed on the ground, the ground quaked. It was as though an earth dragon had flipped over, causing the entire Sea Corpse Race's ancestral land to shake. Huge uproar and cries of surprise rang out from everywhere.At that moment, there were a total of 14 statues in the Sea Corpse Race's territory. Seven of them were spread out in the Sea Corpse Race's territory, and the other seven were on the Seven Blood Eyes' array formations.The array formations rumbled and operated crazily. These seven statues shone with monstrous light. Every one of them erupted with earth-shattering fluctuations like seven incomparably huge power sources!The moment their auras soared into the sky, seven huge blood-colored vortices appeared above the seven statues. They were seven eyes!These seven eyes were all closed, but their appearance caused a violent tsunami to rise in the Forbidden Sea. All the nonhuman races and sea beasts trembled in extreme horror.This was because this was the aura of… a magic treasure. Moreover, it wasn't an ordinary magic treasure but was infinitely close to a Taboo!When this incomparably ferocious aura surged out intensely, above the seven closed eyes, amidst the surging wind and clouds, an ancient bronze mirror that was hundreds of thousands of feet long appeared!This mirror stood in the sky and slowly rotated in all directions. It illuminated the Yinghuang Province in the north, the Seven Blood Eyes in the south, the Corpse Emperor Forbidden in the east, and the Endless Sea in the west.Everything in the surroundings was within its range!Wherever the light shone, the beings in that area felt suffocation and fear!An aura of Taboo suddenly erupted from the mirror as the seven ancestral corpse statues sent in their power.Seven Blood Eyes, Taboo magic treasure, formed!",

Chapter 363 The Truth Is Revealed
The Forbidden Sea was alarmed and the expressions of the various forces changed.The first to react was the Seven Sects Alliance, which was closest to the Sea Corpse Race. In an instant, six huge figures appeared above the Seven Sects Alliance.There were men and women among them, but most of their faces were blurry and they couldn't be seen clearly. The only thing that was clear was the piercing light emitted by their eyes."Seven Blood Eyes…""They really created a Taboo.""Xue Lianzi, you're scheming goes deep and can't be underestimated!"These six figures were the ancestors of six sects of the Seven Sects Alliance's Senate.As their divine senses communicated, they rose into the air at the same time and stepped in the sky, instantly disappearing. Their destination was none other than the Sea Corpse Race.In an instant, their figures appeared in the air above the Sea Corpse Race. As the huge ancient bronze mirror rotated, their hearts trembled as they sensed the terrifying power of this Taboo magic treasure.The moment any magic treasure advanced to a Taboo, it would undergo a mystical transformation and give birth to a strange ability. This ability determined how terrifying a Taboo was."Judgment… It's actually a life-and-death judgment!""The Taboo of the Seven Blood Eyes isn't for destroying a sect but to kill a single target. And, from my senses, the lethality of this treasure… is extremely terrifying!""Once this mirror locks onto a target and is activated, there's a 10% chance that the person being reflected will instantly die. Because of its mirror body, it can be used from an ultra-long distance!""Although the probability is 10%, there are seven eyes above which means it can be activated seven times in a row. In that case, who will dare to gamble?!""Xue Lianzi's cultivation base is at the first stage of Nihility. If he uses this Taboo to initiate a single target judgment, he can kill second stage Nihility!""Second stage… Only the Alliance Leader is at this realm."The six ancestors of the Seven Sects Alliance fell silent as they thought about different things. They knew that Taboo magic treasure were equivalent to the greatest deterrence of a sect. It wasn't something that any sect had the qualifications and ability to possess.The reason why it was the Seven Sects Alliance was because among the 137 sects in the alliance, only their seven sects had Taboos.Moreover, it was almost impossible for Taboo magic treasures to be robbed. For instance, the Taboo of the Seven Blood Eyes was placed here but they didn't dare to snatch it. Once they made a move, the Taboo magic treasure would erupt on its own.This was also the terrifying thing about Taboo magic treasures. They had treasure spirits!This Taboo of the Seven Blood Eyes was even more special. It used seven ancestral corpse statues as its power source. Once those seven closed eyes were opened, one could imagine how terrifying its might would be.Therefore, after observing for a while, the six ancestors of the Seven Sects Alliance looked at each other and performed hand seals, forming an ultra-long-distance teleportation. They instantly disappeared and headed straight for the Seven Blood Eyes.At the same time, the various forces of the Wanggu Continent's Yinghuang Province all used various methods to look at the Seven Blood Eyes. They were very clear that the situation of the Seven Sects Alliance was about to change. The situation of the Wanggu Continent would also change because of this.A storm was coming.As for the Sea Corpse Race's territory, everyone in the Sea Corpse Race trembled in despair. As for the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples guarding this place, their eyes revealed excitement.At that moment, the person who was the most shocked that his expression changed drastically and his breathing became hurried was… the Soaring Cloud Ancestor in the air above the Seven Blood Eyes.His forehead was covered in sweat. The shock in his heart couldn't be concealed and appeared on his face. He stared fixedly in the direction of the Sea Corpse Race.Although he couldn't see the scene there, he could clearly sense that he had been locked onto. It was as though Xue Lianzi only needed a thought to send him into a life-and-death calamity.With this lock, he almost instantly understood the danger he was facing."Life and death judgment… seven times, life and death judgment!"The Soaring Cloud Ancestor's breathing was hurried and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked at Xue Lianzi with a complicated expression. "Now, is my Seven Blood Eyes worthy of being an upper sect?" Xue Lianzi asked calmly.The Soaring Cloud Ancestor opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say. He had now realized all the strategic plans of the Seven Blood Eyes.The Seven Blood Eyes seemed to be fighting the Sea Corpse Race previously but in reality, destroying the Sea Corpse Race wasn't their goal at all.The Seven Blood Eyes had two goals.One was to open a path to the Wanggu Continent.A path appeared in the mind of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor. With the Seven Blood Eyes as the first point, the second point was the merfolk race, the third point was the sub islands of the Sea Corpse Race, and the fourth point was the main island of the Sea Corpse Race.That place was already very close to the Wanggu Continent's Seven Sects Alliance.This was a line, a geographical line that connected the Seven Blood Eyes and the Seven Sects Alliance.Moreover, the Seven Blood Eyes' actions had been very logical. The reason why they attacked the merfolk race was because of the Seventh Peak's competition. This lured the Sea Corpse Race over. Xue Lianzi made a breakthrough and rushed in to heavily injure the Sea Corpse Race's ancestor.This was actually the key factor in the Sea Corpse Race's final defeat.After that, they naturally attacked the Sea Corpse Race and conquered the sub islands step by step, stepping onto the main island.It didn't look like there were any flaws and the strength they revealed didn't exceed the normal.However, this goal was still discovered by the Seven Sects Alliance.Therefore, they interfered in the war of the Sea Corpse Race, causing the Seven Blood Eyes to be unable to continue. Moreover, although the Seven Sects Alliance's main plan was to destroy the Minor Affairs Sect and destroy the dam that blocked a tributary of the Immortal Enrichment River, they didn't completely ignore the Seven Blood Eyes.They planned to strike the mountain to intimidate the tiger. The mountain was the Minor Affairs Sect and the tiger was the Seven Blood Eyes.This way, they would teach the Seven Blood Eyes their place without having to shed any blood.However, they didn't expect that the Seven Blood Eyes had a second goal. Moreover, the Seven Blood Eyes hid this goal even deeper. It was so deep that the Soaring Cloud Ancestor's scalp felt numb.He even felt that the Seven Blood Eyes had deliberately let them notice their first goal.It was to hide their second goal.This didn't seem like Xue Lianzi's style.The second goal of the Seven Blood Eyes was the ancestral corpse statues of the Sea Corpse Race. They wanted to use it as the power source for their magic treasure and advance it to Taboo.There were two prerequisites to this. One was that the Seven Blood Eyes had to have the method to use the ancestral corpse statues as a power source.The second prerequisite was that the Seven Blood Eyes had to find many ancestral corpse statues scattered outside in advance!Clearly, the Seven Blood Eyes had satisfied both of these prerequisites.In fact, the Seven Blood Eyes even considered that the Seven Sects Alliance would interfere at the critical moment and call a halt to the war. Hence, all the anger and unwillingness in the war negotiations only had one goal. That was… to guarantee that they could get at least two ancestral corpse statues.Even after the negotiation with the Sea Corpse Race was completed, the Seven Blood Eyes still remained low. Even though the heaven's chosens of the Seven Sects Alliance had come to challenge to lower their reputation, the Seven Blood Eyes was still silent and waited for the array formations on the Sea Corpse Race.In name, the goal of the array formations was to retrieve the spoils of war. This was reasonable.However, in reality, the Seven Blood Eyes' array formations weren't built to retrieve the two statues but to send five over.The moment the five statues were sent over, they had a total of seven ancestral corpse statues. Moreover, since they were all in the Sea Corpse Race's land, the power of the statues were fully active. Everything was accomplished smoothly."So, when the disciples of the Alliance came to challenge you, you guys deliberately showed weakness to numb us? Now, what's your goal? To become independent in the Wanggu Continent?" The Soaring Cloud Ancestor gritted his teeth and spoke in a low voice.Xue Lianzi didn't answer the first question because that wasn't important anymore. He smiled and calmly answered."I'm getting old. I want to enjoy my old age in the Wanggu Continent. I also hope that there will be an additional chair in the Senate of the Seven Sects Alliance."The Soaring Cloud Ancestor felt extremely aggrieved. However, compared to the matter of the life lantern being snatched and his grandson being heavily injured, the ambition and determination erupting from the Seven Blood Eyes were more important.At this moment, the entire Seven Blood Eyes was extremely quiet. The disciples didn't know the details but they could sense that the atmosphere was different. When they heard the ancestor's words, their hearts raced and all kinds of guesses rose.Xu Qing lifted his head and stared at the sea. At that instant earlier, he vaguely sensed something but it was blurry."I see. These old men are too sinister. I finally know what their trump card is." The captain let out a long sigh and his eyes revealed vigor. He was clearly muttering to himself but he deliberately raised his voice.Xu Qing looked over. Third Senior Brother also looked over suspiciously. Second Senior Sister was still transmitting her voice."Eldest Senior Brother, do you really know? Is it a Taboo? A Taboo of our Seven Blood Eyes?" The third brother was uncertain.Xu Qing looked at the unfathomable captain and was also uncertain."This matter is worth 1,000 spirit stones. If any of you want to know, I'll tell you." The captain sighed with emotion."You know bullsh*t!" Old Master Seventh's voice appeared.The captain was embarrassed. While he was coughing, Old Master Seventh's voice entered their ears. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' "This is a plan I came up with for the ancestor. The plan has been in progress for a hundred years and has been completed step by step until now.""You guys don't have to guess. At this moment, on the territory of the Sea Corpse Race, there's a Taboo magic treasure that belongs to our Seven Blood Eyes. It's also the eighth Taboo magic treasure in the Seven Sects Alliance. It can keep other forces in check and ensure that the Seven Blood Eyes can smoothly enter Wanggu.""From now on, the name of the Seven Sects Alliance will also change." Old Master Seventh turned his head and glanced at his four disciples with a faint smile."Do you think the name Eight Sects Alliance sounds better?"The instant Old Master Seventh spoke, the color of the sky changed and waves of aura that shook the surroundings descended.Six god-like existences appeared in the sky around Xue Lianzi and the Soaring Cloud Ancestor.They were the ancestors of the other six sects in the Seven Sects Alliance's Senate!Almost at the instant they appeared, an old woman walked out of the Seven Blood Eyes and soared into the sky. She arrived in a single step and stood beside Xue Lianzi, smiling at the Seven Sects Alliance."Long time no see.""I took a nap earlier and heard that someone wants the Seven Blood Eyes to hand over Xu Qing. My granddaughter likes that kid very much and I am considering a marriage alliance. If he's killed, my granddaughter will be unhappy and so will I.""I don't have a big family. I only have one granddaughter. If I'm unhappy, I'll make you guys unhappy too!"

Chapter 364 Eight Sects Alliance (1)
Esteemed Master Dongyou's voice echoed through the entire sect.Xu Qing remained silent.The captain and Third Senior Brother instantly looked at him. Even Second Senior Sister stopped transmitting her voice and looked at Xu Qing.Old Master Seventh also turned his head and looked at Xu Qing with admiration in his eyes."Not bad, you have the demeanor of me back then."As he spoke, he looked at the other three disciples with disappointment. However, when he glanced at his second disciple, he automatically ignored her and focused on the eldest and third disciples.Regarding the third disciple, he thought about it and ignored him. Hence, his gaze landed on the eldest."You should learn from your junior brother!" 'If I looked like him, I can do it too. It's very difficult to imitate Little Qing's face with spells!' The captain felt aggrieved and a little depressed.The person who was even more depressed and even unable to release his anger was the Soaring Cloud Ancestor. He stared at Esteemed Master Dongyou with an incomparably unsightly expression.Forget it if Xue Lianzi wanted to protect that lowly commoner, but he didn't expect that Esteemed Master Dongyou, who didn't care about the world and never joined forces with others, would also speak up for that commoner.He thought of how his grandson was heavily injured with his survival unknown. He thought of how his sect's life lantern had been snatched and how things hadn't gone smoothly this time. He thought of how the Seven Blood Eyes already had the qualifications to enter the ranks of the upper sects and how their overall strength wasn't inferior to any of the seven sects.All of this caused his eyes to be bloodshot. However, he was very clear that there was no way to stop the Seven Blood Eyes from advancing to an upper sect. After all, the Seven Sects Alliance was an alliance and not a sect.There were eight people in the Senate - one Alliance leader and seven ancestors. Although they shared common interests, there were also frictions between them. The current strength of the Seven Blood Eyes, especially that Taboo magic treasure, allowed the other party to not only have the qualifications to become an upper sect but also increase the strength of the alliance by a large margin if they entered the Seven Sects Alliance.He was well aware that others would definitely tacitly agree to such a thing. He even recalled the series of plans of the Seven Blood Eyes. He wouldn't believe it if someone said that the Seven Blood Eyes wouldn't have supporters in the Seven Blood Eyes.He gritted his teeth and spoke."Seven Blood Eyes, return the life lantern and my Soaring Cloud Sword Sect will fully support you in joining the alliance! Otherwise, you'll have to bear the consequences! Xue Lianzi, whether you want to be an enemy or a friend, you can decide!"As he spoke, the Soaring Cloud Ancestor pointed at the sky. Immediately, the blood tree that had already condensed to a certain extent in the sea of blood in the sky sank, as though it was about to descend on the Seven Blood Eyes.In an instant, the pressure on the Seven Blood Eyes rose greatly. Xue Lianzi laughed angrily."Interesting. Soaring Cloud, you have a lot of vicious thoughts. If my Seven Blood Eyes still has to sacrifice the benefits of the disciples to join the alliance, what will the disciples think of my sect?""If there are greater benefits in the future, do we have to sacrifice them too? Wouldn't our allies think that we can sacrifice them too in the future? How much will our sect's reputation be damaged because of this?""Old fool, your words are heartbreaking.""Looks like you don't believe in our sect's Taboo."Xue Lianzi's gaze turned sharp and he waved his right hand. Immediately, the world rumbled. The instant the expressions of the surrounding Seven Sects Alliance's ancestors turned solemn, the huge ancient bronze mirror on the Sea Corpse Race suddenly rotated and faced the Seven Blood Eyes. When it locked onto the Seven Blood Eyes, one of the seven eyes above the seven ancestral corpse statues suddenly opened. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' This eye had no pupils and was blood-colored. The moment it opened, a cold wind that seemed to be able to freeze the nine heavens directly enveloped the top of the Seven Blood Eyes. It also reflected the figure of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor in the mirror.The expression of the Soaring Cloud Ancestor changed and an intense life-and-death crisis instantly erupted in his mind. It had been a long time since he had felt such a crisis.His body down to the minute cells trembled, his soul shook, his life let out a sharp cry like it was facing its natural enemy, like the other party controlled his life and death and grabbed his soul.The feeling that he could die in the next instant caused Soaring Cloud's heart to tremble violently. His cultivation erupted as he tried to resist.At that moment, a cold voice rang out from the bronze mirror."Life and death, judgment!"The mirror reflected the Soaring Cloud Ancestor and the image was distorting. He turned around and revealed extreme ferocity and malevolence. It was as though he existed alone and was no longer Soaring Cloud. His body instantly collapsed and exploded!After that, the eye closed.At the same time, in the Seven Blood Eyes, the Soaring Cloud Ancestor started coughing blood. His body shook and just like the image in the mirror, his entire body collapsed and turned into a blood mist.The blood mist gathered together again. However, there was only paleness on his face and the flowing light in his eyes had become extremely dim. His expression also revealed disbelief.At that moment, that cold voice rang out again."Judgment failed. Awaiting second judgment."Xue Lianzi's expression was sinister. Just as he was about to attack, the other six ancestors of the Seven Sects Alliance immediately stopped him. However, at the next instant, Xue Lianzi laughed sinisterly and roared."Full activation!"In an instant, under the ancient bronze mirror above the Sea Corpse Race, the qi and blood of the seven ancestral corpse statues churned unprecedentedly. Their AURA soared into the sky and wanted to devour mountains and rivers. The six eyes that hadn't opened and the seventh eye that had just closed opened instantly!!The seven eyes divided into seven gazes that passed through the Forbidden Sea and landed on the seven ancestors of the Seven Sects Alliance in the Seven Blood Eyes!
