At that moment, under the setting sun, the afterglow scattered on the mountain path, as though it was draping a layer of orange-yellow gauze over the stone steps, adding a hint of holiness.It was as though walking on it and stepping on the sunlight could lead one to glory.On both sides of the mountain path, green leaves, flowers, and grass could be seen everywhere. The fragrance and the smell of soil blended into the mountain breeze that blew past. As the humidity gushed into his face, it seeped into his mind and permeated his entire body.The surrounding trees provided shade and the crisp chirping of birds could be heard from time to time. It was as though they were composing a tune for the future of everyone who had walked through this mountain path, including the group of people here.Among the group of five, the one at the front was the round-faced middle-aged man. He had his hands behind his back and introduced the sect to Xu Qing and the others as he walked."Since you guys have successfully entered the Seven Blood Eyes, let me explain the sect to you. Actually, in my opinion, the Seven Blood Eyes isn't a sect.""It's more like a hugely profitable business in the name of the sect!"p The round-faced middle-aged man spoke calmly. When his words fell into the ears of the four people behind him, it caused the hearts of these newly-joined youths to tremble.Among the four people, other than Xu Qing, the other three were Zhou Qingpeng, Li Zimei, and a young girl.The girl's name was Xu Xiaohui. She had a ponytail and wore ordinary clothes. Clearly, she wasn't from a wealthy family but she was much better off than scavengers. She should have come from a small city.On the way, she expressed her goodwill to Xu Qing. However, Xu Qing wasn't good at socializing and didn't like people getting too close to him. Hence, he only nodded. Very soon, this young girl started to curry favor with Zhou Qingpeng.Zhou Qingpeng's smile was gentle, contrary to Xu Qing's reticence. This caused the young girl to feel closer to him. The two of them would occasionally whisper to each other on the way.As for Li Xiaomei, she seemed to be very reserved and felt a little inferior. Hence, she was at the end of the group and kept a certain distance from everyone.However, Zhou Qingpeng paid a lot of attention to her and Xu Qing. Hence, he would occasionally take the initiative to reveal a smile, causing Li Zimei to feel less reserved.At that moment, the mountain breeze blew past, lifting everyone's hair. It also transmitted the words of the round-faced middle-aged man."The Seven Blood Eyes are divided into the top of the mountain and the bottom of the mountain. You can see them as two different worlds which is indeed the case. You people… are people from the bottom of the mountain."Only those who have reached the Foundation Building Realm are qualified to ascend the mountain and have the right to distribute the benefits of the Seven Blood Eyes. As for the people at the foot of the mountain, they live in cruelty and hardship and can only struggle."So to the people at the foot of the mountain, going up the mountain is the greatest desire in their lives. Do you know how many people are in the main city at the foot of the mountain?" The round-faced middle-aged man glanced at the four youths behind him."Three million people!" He raised his right hand and extended three fingers. "These three million people include the commoners and all the low-level disciples of the various peaks. You will also be one of them. You need to survive under the rules of the Seven Blood Eyes.""The rules of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city are very simple. They are contribution points. For everyone at the foot of the mountain, be it commoners or disciples, the fee for staying in the main city every day is 30 contribution points, which is 30 spirit coins."It will be deducted every day. Once the number on the jade slip token reaches zero, one will be expelled from the Seven Blood Eyes. It's the same for commoners and disciples.""If you forcefully stay, you will be killed by the array formation in two hours."The round-faced cultivator's words caused the expressions of Xu Qing and the other three to change. Even though Zhou Qingpeng had some understanding of this, when he heard this rule again, fear still appeared in his eyes."This is only the basic residency fee. As for food and accommodation, it's up to you. Survival of the fittest. The prices of goods in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city are extremely high but the highest of them all is still cultivation resources."  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Hearing the round-faced cultivator's words, Xu Qing fell silent. The other three were also intimidated by this harsh statement. Xu Xiaohui hesitated for a moment before asking in a low voice."Since that's the case, why are there still so many commoners here? 30 spirit coins a day… that's one spirit stone a month. This is too expensive. Besides, we have obtained the status of disciples and we have to pay contribution points as well. What's the use of being a disciple?"The round-faced middle-aged man glanced at Xu Xiaohui."The commoners who were able to teleport here at such a high price are all capable people. The reason why they fought to be the first to arrive was that the Seven Blood Eyes' main city protects the commoners. Disciples can't slaughter the innocent. Also… there's a formation here that isolates anomalous substances, allowing one's lifespan to increase.""Compared to the anomalous substances pervading the outside world and ferocious beasts causing people to flee for their lives everywhere, the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes is naturally the place of their dreams.""What's the use of becoming a disciple?""Firstly, the cultivation resources are only open to those who have obtained the qualifications to become a disciple. Others can't buy them and it's strictly forbidden for them to be circulated outside. Once caught, they will definitely die."Secondly, only disciples who cultivate the Seven Blood Eyes' cultivation method can have the right to ascend the mountain and obtain the right to distribute benefits after cultivating the Seven Blood Eyes to the Foundation Establishment Realm. Therefore, you all have to work harder in the future. Although the sect doesn't allow internal strife on the surface, every month… there are still quite many disciples who mysteriously disappear from the city. Regarding this, the sect mostly turns a blind eye. After all, it's normal for deaths and injuries to occur when cultivating Gu."However, once an external Foundation Building cultivator makes a move against you Qi Condensation disciples, the person who makes a move will be severely punished. This is considered breaking the rules of the Seven Blood Eyes. Of course, the sect doesn't care about external Qi Condensation cultivators."The round-faced cultivator smiled meaningfully.When Xu Qing heard these words, he heaved a sigh of relief. This was one of the reasons he came to the Seven Blood Eyes.

Chapter 82 Making A Living From Boats (2)
At this moment, Li Xiaomei hesitated before asking."If that's the case, then how can the sect make the disciples who grew up in such an environment feel a sense of belonging? How can the sect itself be cohesive?"The round-faced cultivator laughed."Cohesion? What is cohesion? Friendship is one type, gratitude is another type, and reverence is another type. However, these aren't firm. In this cruel chaotic world, true belonging and true cohesion are benefits!""As long as a Seven Blood Eyes disciple breaks through to the Foundation Establishment realm with the Seven Blood Eyes cultivation technique, they will be able to obtain the qualifications to ascend the mountain. They can also obtain the right to distribute the profits of the Seven Blood Eyes.""The monthly income of the Seven Blood Eyes is public. It comes from the living expenses of everyone, the trading of cultivation resources, as well as the exchange of goods at the port. About 500 million spirit coins are entering the account every day. If it's converted to spirit stones, it'll be 500,000 spirit stones and the monthly income will be 15 million spirit stones."These benefits will be distributed according to the rights and interests of different cultivation levels. Other than the sect keeping a portion of the daily expenses, the rest will be distributed to all disciples at the Foundation Establishment realm and above.""The higher one's cultivation level is, the more they will be allocated. Early-stage Foundation Building disciples can receive about 5,000 spirit stones a month. If they reach the Core Formation Realm, they will receive at least tens of thousands of spirit stones a month."This is why I said that the Seven Blood Eyes is more like an industry. All the Foundation Establishment disciples who have been promoted to the mountain are equivalent to investing in this industry. As long as the Seven Blood Eyes exists, there will be a day of profit!""So, do you think that when an external enemy wants to plunder your assets, you will watch helplessly as your interests are taken away and not take action?"As the round-faced cultivator's voice rang out, Xu Qing's eyes revealed a deep light. He now had a thorough understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes.The cohesiveness in troubled times. Perhaps it was really as the other party said. Benefits could bind everything.Li Xiaomei fell silent as well.  BEst novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  The round-faced cultivator smiled faintly. He had brought many batches of new disciples with him. Just like what he had said earlier, he had said it many times. In this chaotic world, benefits were something that had never changed. At this moment, at the foot of the mountain."I'll tell you guys about the prosperity of the Seven Blood Eyes. Look over there. That's the largest port in the entire Nanhuang Continent. There is an endless stream of ships coming and going on normal days. No matter which power in the outside world transports goods, or if the disciples of the other peaks head out to the sea to complete their missions, most of them have to pass through us. The seventh peak controls this port area.""Therefore, boats are the key to the cultivation of the Seventh Peak's disciples. We call them magic boats."Xu Qing followed the direction of his finger. At that moment, under the glow of the setting sun, he could see the main city's port below.Near the sea, many horseshoe-shaped harbors were dug out. Each of them was very large and seemed to be able to accommodate a large number of boats. There were quite a lot of such harbors, numbering in the hundreds.It was majestic and spread far away. At the same time, the overall color was also different. Half of it was white and there were many huge merchant ships inside. There was also half a harbor and the buildings inside were mostly purple. From afar, the boats in the purple zone were all very small and densely packed.Other than that, every harbor had a gate and a tall lighthouse."Outside the white zone, the purple zone is the residence of the Seventh Peak's disciples.""The boat inside is the magic boat I mentioned earlier!" The round-faced cultivator's voice rang out."My Seventh Peak's magic boat is famous in the entire Nanhuang Continent. It is also the core and soul of our disciples' cultivation.""It's your cave abode, your mount, your companion in battle, and a necessity for obtaining resources. You can completely treat the magic boat as a magic treasure!"When the round-faced cultivator said this, Li Zimei and Xu Xiaohui's eyes widened. It was obvious that they knew about the existence of magic treasures. Zhou Qingpeng's eyes also shone with a strange light, filled with intense anticipation.Xu Qing was the same. His heart trembled. He was very clear about the value and rarity of magic treasures. Hence, he looked at the purple area at the harbor again. However, the densely-packed boats there made him feel that they were somewhat in conflict with the rarity of magic treasures. "Of course, it's not a magic treasure with a true meaning. However, the magic boats of my Seventh Peak have the potential to grow. As your cultivation realm increases and you continue to refine them, sooner or later, they can become magic treasures.""Therefore, having one's own magic boat is the greatest dream and pursuit for every disciple who has just entered the Seventh Peak.""However, the most basic magic boat also needs to be exchanged. It requires 100,000 contribution points, which is 100 spirit stones.""In addition, only disciples with magic boats are qualified to be randomly assigned to work and cultivate in the harbor.""As for disciples who don't have a magic boat, they can only search for ways to earn money on their own. The limit is three years. If they can't accumulate enough contribution points to exchange for a magic boat within three years, their cultivation will be taken back and they will be expelled."That's because the cultivation technique of my Seventh Peak is related to the sea. By combining it with the cultivation of the magic boat and borrowing the spirit-gathering array within, it will yield twice the result with half the effort. Oh right, cultivation techniques are free. You can obtain them by becoming a disciple."Hearing the words of the round-faced middle-aged man, Xu Qing's heart stirred. While he was attracted by the Seventh Peak's special magic boat, he also gradually gained a better understanding of the Seventh Peak.The magic boat was a crucial item for the Seventh Peak's disciples.Disciples who owned a magic boat would have their responsibilities assigned to them and they had the right to stay in the harbor's purple-colored sea area. Therefore, the round-faced middle-aged man had previously said that the boat was a cave abode. However, it seemed that living there would require contribution points.

Chapter 83 Making A Living From Boats (3)
As for the disciples who didn't have a boat, they could only do odd jobs on the shore. They struggled to cultivate and had to work hard to accumulate contribution points every day.It was also because the other summits and even the entire Nanhuang Continent had to travel through this place when they went out to sea. Hence, there were many times when they had to rent a boat from the Seventh Peak's disciples. This was also a way to earn contribution points.In the entire Seventh Peak, the vast majority of disciples were like this. Everyone was working hard to survive, wanting to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm and obtain the right to distribute the benefits of the Seven Blood Eyes."Therefore, the magic boat and cultivation base are the keys to whether one can survive on the seventh peak before reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.""I have to exchange for a magic boat as soon as possible!" Xu Qing's eyes gleamed as he felt an intense sense of urgency.Just like that, under the introduction of the round-faced cultivator, Xu Qing and the others followed him to the middle of the mountain. This was the place where all the functions of the identity token were unlocked for new disciples. At the same time, there were also cultivation arts and Daoist robes.There was only one type of Daoist robe and that was the gray one.The gray-colored Daoist robe was the basic clothing of all Seven Blood Eyes's peak disciples. As long as a disciple unlocked their identity token, they would be given it for free.However, opening the token required 1,000 contribution points. After opening it, the token recorded everyone's basic information and contribution points. It could also be used for communication.As everyone obtained their cultivation arts and activated their identity tokens one after another, they obtained a gray Daoist robe. Xu Qing held it in his hand and sensed the weak spirit energy fluctuations emitted from it. He knew that the material of this Daoist robe was extraordinary.It felt very soft and wouldn't easily crease. If it was placed in the outside world, the value of this Daoist robe would probably be quite high.  BEst novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  Li Xiaomei, who was at the side, was similar to Xu Qing. She was also stroking her Daoist robe and her eyes revealed determination. Beside her, Xu Xiaohui looked at Zhou Qingpeng.Zhou Qingpeng blinked. After his gaze swept past the round-faced cultivator and the sect senior who was distributing the supplies, he suddenly spoke softly."Senior, I want to buy a magic boat."The round-faced cultivator smiled when he heard this. The person distributing the supplies was a skinny old man. He rolled his eyes and glanced at Zhou Qingpeng as he calmly spoke."100,000 contribution points, or 100 spirit stones." As soon as the skinny old man spoke, both Li Xiaomei and Xu Xiaohui sucked in a breath. To them, 100 spirit stones was an unimaginable sum of money.At that moment, Zhou Qingpeng hurriedly stepped forward and took out a golden note, respectfully handing it over."The second peak's spirit ticket? Sure." The old man took it and looked at it. After that, he took out a purple brocade box and pushed it over. After that, he raised his head and looked at the others."Do any of you still want to exchange?"Li Xiaomei and Xu Xiaohui lowered their heads. After some thought, Xu Qing endured the pain and stepped forward to take out 100 spirit stones from his leather pouch, placing them in front of the skinny old man.The old man didn't say a word. Under the envy of Li Zimei and Xu Xiaohui and the sidelong glance of Zhou Qingpeng, he also gave him a brocade box.Xu Qing took it and opened it. There were only two items in the brocade box: a jade slip and a small transparent bottle.The small bottle was very strange. It was only the size of a palm and half of it was filled with a liquid that looked like seawater. Above the seawater, there was a small boat with a black canopy!This small boat was completely black and looked simple. However, upon closer inspection, one would discover that every plank on the boat was filled with a large number of runes. Even though the entire boat was separated by a bottle, it still emitted waves of extraordinary pressure.It could be said that whether it was the bottle itself or the small boat, their value far exceeded 100 spirit stones. As for the jade slip, it recorded information about the small boat."Alright, you guys can leave the mountain now. Remember not to spread the cultivation arts and magic boats to outsiders. Otherwise… you'll end up in a very miserable state." The round-faced middle-aged man's voice interrupted Xu Qing's observation."Xu Xiaohui and Li Zimei, the two of you should work harder. Take care of yourselves and strive to obtain the magic boat as soon as possible. As for Zhou Qingpeng and Xu Qing, your identity tokens contain information about your roles. You can go on your own."The four of them immediately cupped their fists toward the round-faced cultivator. Just as Xu Qing was about to leave, he was stopped by the round-faced cultivator."Xu Qing."Xu Qing turned his head and looked respectfully at the round-faced cultivator."Among low-level cultivators, you're very strong. You're clearly at the seventh level of Body Refinement but you managed to form the qi and blood shadow that only those at the great circle of Body Refinement have. It can be seen that your talent isn't bad. It can be said that among low-level cultivators, you're already an expert. Killing some miscellaneous cultivators, as well as those at the ninth or tenth level of Qi Condensation, is also an easy feat." "However, body refinement is relatively simple. It's just the accumulation of speed, strength, and recovery. This isn't the Great Dao.""The Great Dao of us cultivators is to cultivate laws! I advise you to re-cultivate laws in the future. The spirit energy in your body is too weak. It's fine when you face miscellaneous cultivators but if you face a large sect's disciple, you'll be at a disadvantage!"When Xu Qing heard this, his heart trembled."Also, I don't know where you lived before but I believe that danger lurked in every corner, so you developed some instinctive habits of yours."Habits?" Xu Qing was stunned."Seeing that this is a test I performed for you, let me remind you. For example, when you walk, your right hand hardly moves and your index and middle fingers are always on guard. I'm guessing that in the leather pouch on your right, there's a needle-shaped or throwing-knife-type weapon that can be clamped between two fingers. It'll be convenient for you to take it out at any time."Xu Qing's expression froze. This was the first time someone had seen through him so clearly."However, I advise you not to treat habits as nature. If that's the case, it'll be very easy for others to see through you and you'll be at a disadvantage. You have to know that there are no traces. Hiding a needle in cotton is the way of our generation."The round-faced middle-aged man smiled as he spoke. He didn't look sharp at all. This time, he reminded this disciple in front of him. To him, it was just a small investment.However, Xu Qing felt a chill down his spine. He stood there and took a deep breath before bowing deeply to the other party.Even when he was far away, Xu Qing's heart was still echoing with the other party's words. He lowered his head and looked at his right hand, trying his best to control it and make it more natural.Under this attempt at control, his right hand slowly changed. It was no longer stiff but a little more natural. However, if one took a closer look, they would be able to see that there seemed to be sharpness hidden in every shake of this nature.On his way down the mountain, he kept trying. In the wilderness far away from the Seven Blood Eyes, in an unfamiliar scavenger campsite, Old Master Seventh was squatting on a rooftop. He looked with interest at a youth not far away who was fighting a wild dog. The youth's mouth was stained with the flesh and blood of the dog and his expression seemed to be bloodthirsty.Seeing this scene, admiration appeared in Old Master Seventh's eyes.Beside him, the servant was also squatting there. At that moment, he took out the jade slip and checked it before speaking in a low voice."Old Master Seventh, the kid has reached the Seven Blood Eyes.""What kid?" Old Master Seventh looked at the youth in front of him and casually asked.The servant smiled bitterly and explained in a low voice."It's that youth who couldn't bear to wear his new clothes before he killed. You even helped him speak to Grandmaster Bai to teach him the way of plants and vegetation. After that, you gave him a white token."Old Master Seventh had a dazed look on his face as he nodded. When he recalled Xu Qing, his eyes once again revealed admiration."I remember now. That was a good and loyal kid.",m "Do you need to give him special care?" the servant asked.Old Master Seventh waved his hand."There's no need. In this chaotic world, if you want to survive, you have to rely on yourself to work hard. If he can finally rely on himself and reach me, I'll give him a piece of good fortune." As he spoke, Old Master Seventh pointed at the youth fighting with the wild dogs not far away."Do you think this youth or that kid is more like a wolf cub?"The servant looked at the youth Old Master Seventh was referring to and smiled bitterly. He had answered similar questions several times. This was the ninth child Old Master Seventh had taken a liking to since he was a child."They're all about the same."When Old Master Seventh heard this, he turned his head to glance at the servant and suddenly laughed."I helped the kid speak to Grandmaster Bai and gave him the white token. This was originally a favor from me but this doesn't mean that I have to accept him as my disciple. I don't owe him anything. I'm just giving him a chance.""While it's true that I wanted to take in a fourth disciple, when I took in my third back then, I only managed to get him after giving out over 50 white tokens. You haven't spent much time with me, so you don't know my

At that moment, the setting sun was approaching dusk.The afterglow scattered on the mountain path and gradually dimmed.Xu Qing carried the brocade box on his back and looked at the sky. His mind recalled the words of the round-faced cultivator and his understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes became clear.He knew that this main city looked orderly but in reality, it hid tremendous dangers. This was especially so at night, where the malice from all directions was even more intense. There would always be people who chose to bare their fangs to others to better survive.There was no right or wrong in this.However, Xu Qing didn't wish to become nourishment for others to better survive. Hence, he touched the brocade box on his back and prepared to find a dark place to store it in his storage bag without anyone noticing.Hence, he quickened his pace.Not long later, he descended the mountain path and saw two figures who had changed into gray Daoist robes at the foot of the mountain.The man and woman were Zhou Qingpeng and Xu Xiaohui.Xu Xiaohui had a beautiful appearance. Although the gray robe hid her graceful figure, regardless of whether it was her chest or the slight bulge on her butt, it made the gray robe give her an additional seductive charm.As for Zhou Qingpeng, he was handsome to begin with. At that moment, with his gray Daoist robe on, he looked very elegant, causing Xu Xiaohui's gaze to turn blurry.She just didn't know if it was Zhou Qingpeng or his magic boat that she was in a daze about.Seeing Xu Qing's figure appear, Zhou Qingpeng laughed and walked toward him."Xu Qing, you're finally down. I've been waiting for you for a while."Xu Qing's expression was as usual but his heart was filled with vigilance. He didn't get close and only lifted his head to look at Zhou Qingpeng's neck from 70 to 80 feet away. His right hand casually rested beside the pocket where the black iron stick was hidden."We are all disciples of the Seventh Peak and entered the sect in the same batch. Moreover, we aren't very familiar with each other in the sect, so I think we should get closer.""This way, if anything happens in the future, I'll have one more friend and one more connection." Zhou Qingpeng's attitude was sincere as he cupped his fists at Xu Qing.When Xu Qing heard this, his vigilance didn't decrease. However, he felt that what the other party said made sense, so he nodded.The smile on Zhou Qingpeng's face was still the same and he simply said a few words. He saw that Xu Qing didn't like to speak, so he exchanged communications information from afar before bidding farewell and leaving with Xu Xiaohui.Looking at their departing figures, Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at the identity token in his hand. The communication information that the other party had exchanged earlier was using this token as a medium."I can speak with this?" Xu Qing curiously sized it up. As the spirit energy in his body gushed in, the information within the token instantly appeared in his mind.This made him feel very strange, so he continued to study it as he moved forward. When he entered the city, he found a corner and placed the brocade box on his back into his storage bag. He didn't change into a gray Daoist robe. He was still wearing that dirty leather coat.If it was during the day, his scavenger attire would be very eye-catching in this clean and tidy main city. However, it was nighttime now, so it was more convenient for him to hide. At the same time, he felt that this attire could also avoid some troubles that he couldn't resolve.After all, most scavengers were very poor. Those who could target him naturally wouldn't be experts, so he could handle them.At the same time, he also studied the effects of the identity token and knew how to transmit his voice. He also saw the information about the department he was in."The Murder Department?" Xu Qing mumbled. Although he didn't understand the functions of the department, he could guess a thing or two from its name. This department seemed very savage and dangerous.As for the registration time, the information stated that it would be tomorrow. At the same time, in this identity token, there was also the location of his small boat.For disciples who owned a magic boat, the sect would allocate their own berths and give them a month's rent-free period. After a month, they would have to pay a fee. The price was 30,000 contribution points per month, which was 30 spirit stones. If they didn't pay, their berths would be automatically cancelled."The 79th Port, 'Xuan' No. 33?" Xu Qing lifted his head and looked in the direction of the sea. His figure flashed in the darkness as he moved forward rapidly with deep vigilance, trying his best not to reveal his tracks.Just like that, time flowed by. Very soon, dusk was far away and night fell.Thousands of households in the city closed their doors one after another. The commotion during the day turned into silence at this moment.The darkness of the night also completely concealed Xu Qing's figure. He slowly narrowed his eyes and quickened his pace. Gradually, he noticed the ferocity of the night in this dark city.He saw slaughter, he saw people fleeing for their lives, he saw the coldness in the pursuit and he also saw robbery.,m Regarding this, Xu Qing, who was hiding in the dark, merely swept his gaze over before retracting it. He didn't participate and continued on his way.In the darkness, his figure was like a ghost.Other than that, he also saw some casinos. At the railings, the lights were brightly lit, revealing the prosperity on the other side of the city. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Perhaps it was because Xu Qing was even more cautious and stealthy this time around, he didn't encounter anyone who attacked him on the way.However, occasionally, he could still feel gazes from the darkness that contained coldness and malice. However, after noticing his scavenger attire, most of them ignored him as though he didn't exist.Xu Qing fell silent and sped away. After another two hours, he was getting closer and closer to the harbor.There were over a hundred ports here and the place Xu Qing wanted to go was the 79th port in the purple zone.However, just as he was searching, Xu Qing's expression suddenly changed. He hid at the entrance of an alley and looked ahead.Waves of footsteps and whistling sounds rang out from afar. Very soon, Xu Qing saw a group of gray-robed cultivators. Each of them had a murderous look on their face, and their bodies emitted a cold aura as they sped over.

Chapter 85 Colleagues (2)
Some were on the road and some were on the surrounding buildings, seemingly searching.On their Daoist robes, there was a badge with a blood-colored 'Constable' character on it.This scene caused Xu Qing to squint his eyes. He could sense the spirit energy fluctuations from these Seven Blood Eyes disciples and many of them were filled with baleful auras."The Homicide Division?" Xu Qing guessed.At that moment, some of these Seven Blood Eyes cultivators discovered Xu Qing who was in the corner. Even though he hid very well, there were many of them and they were filled with vigilance. Hence, he couldn't avoid them.Among them, there was a youth with phoenix eyes. After he coldly glanced at Xu Qing, he quickly walked over.As the other party got closer, a wave of fiendish intent gushed over. Xu Qing's body instantly tensed up. He could sense an incomparably intense sense of danger from the other party. Before the other party arrived, his aura had already permeated the surroundings like a cold wind.Only those who had killed a lot of people would possess such killing intent.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He knew that if he were to flee now, under the influence of his aura, the other party would definitely attack. Hence, he stood there and didn't retreat. Instead, he looked at the other party. At the same time, his right hand landed on the leather bag containing the black iron stick, ready to be taken out at any moment."Identity token!" After the youth arrived, he sized up Xu Qing and his gaze landed on his right hand.Many of the disciples at the side also moved closer, surrounding Xu Qing from all directions. Their expressions were ice-cold, as though they would immediately act if Xu Qing showed the slightest hint of abnormality.Xu Qing noticed the gaze of the other party and became even more determined to change his habit. At that moment, he swept his gaze across the surroundings and cautiously took out his identity token before passing it over.The youth took it and looked at it. The coldness on his face faded a little and he felt a little surprised. He then smiled at his companion beside him."I actually met a newbie who is supposed to report to our Seventh Peak's Homicide Division.""Alright, everyone, restrain yourselves. Don't let the little kid be scared to the point that he doesn't dare to report back even though he wasn't killed by the murderer." As his voice rang out, most of the auras in the surroundings retracted. However, there were still a few who locked onto Xu Qing."As expected of the Homicide Division." Xu Qing felt that the locked-on aura on his body was reduced by more than half. As for the youth with phoenix eyes, he returned the token to Xu Qing and sized him up."Kid, you're a little interesting. Hurry up and leave. The city is very dangerous tonight."When Xu Qing heard this, he nodded and took back his identity token. Just as he was about to leave, at that moment, in the distant night, a mournful cry pierced through the air.This voice was sharp and echoed with roars.Xu Qing's expression turned serious and he immediately turned his head. He instantly saw a black shadow spewing out blood as it sped through the air on top of a building in the distance.Although the spirit energy fluctuations on his body were a little chaotic, his Foundation Building aura caused Xu Qing's heart to tremble.Behind him was a middle-aged man in a purple Daoist robe. He had a dignified expression and an imposing aura. Even though the spirit energy fluctuations were far away, they still rose like flames and were even more powerful.As the sky whistled closer, the purple-robed middle-aged man directly raised his hand. A spear suddenly appeared in his hand and he ruthlessly threw it forward.The void seemed to have exploded, creating a huge shockwave that spread out in all directions. The spear seemed to burn from the friction and transformed into a fire dragon that charged straight for the fleeing black shadow.From afar, it looked like the sky was about to be torn apart, causing the fire dragon's light to be dazzling and extremely gorgeous.Its speed was so fast that it instantly tore through the air. Under the even sharper whistling sound, it penetrated the black shadow's chest like a hot knife through butter. With a bang, its body was nailed to the green bricks on the street. The impact it caused was like a storm that swept in all directions.It was clean and efficient! This scene caused Xu Qing's mind to tremble intensely. From what Xu Qing felt, the black shadow killed by the other party was similar to the Diamond Sect's ancestor.As for the purple-robed middle-aged man's spear, it was incomparably powerful. He felt that if he were to encounter it, he wouldn't have the slightest chance to dodge it and would die.​ "It's the Division Chief!""Let's go!"At that moment, the expressions of those disciples from the Murder Division beside him were filled with excitement. They no longer bothered Xu Qing and instead, they all charged toward the battlefield at full speed.Even after they had walked far away, the shock in Xu Qing's heart as well as the graceful bearing of that spear still filled his mind. After a long while, he drew in a deep breath, and his gaze revealed a hint of desire."I wonder when I'll be able to do the same!" Xu Qing mumbled. He cast a deep glance in the direction the purple-robed middle-aged man had disappeared in before turning and walking away quickly.He sensed that the night wasn't peaceful. At that moment, he sped up. After an hour, he finally found Port 79.The harbor was different from the inside of the city. The light here was even dimmer. Although guards were patrolling and although they were vigilant, when they saw pedestrians, they would choose to avoid them. Clearly, their vigilance wasn't for order but to prevent themselves from being harmed.After seeing Xu Qing, they acted the same way. After taking a glance, they didn't ask any questions and immediately walked far away.Xu Qing warily looked at the patrolling cultivators who had walked far away and fell silent. He now had a better understanding of the dangers of the Seven Blood Eyes. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At that moment, he slowly approached the harbor. Here, the humidity of the sea breeze was even clearer. As the sound of waves rose and fell, one could see the 79th harbor forming the shape of a horse's hoof. The seawater was swaying within, constantly hitting the shore.The boats inside were mostly separated by a certain distance, as though they were on guard against each other. Their sizes were about the same but their shapes were slightly different. However, upon closer inspection, the basic appearance of the boats was that of the small boats in Xu Qing's bottle. There were over 200 of them.However, this 79th Bay was too big. The number of ships docked here took up less than 20% of the space.Although there were some lights inside, it was very quiet. There was no sign of any disciples heading out either. To everyone, the descent of night was the highest peak of vigilance.At the same time, Xu Qing also discovered that the spirit energy here was very dense, and so were the anomalous substances. They seemed to be emanating from the sea.The pitch-black seawater blocked one's vision, making it impossible to see what was at the bottom of the sea.This unknownness made one feel uneasy. At the same time, the bottom of the sea seemed to be hiding a great danger. Xu Qing only took a glance and felt all the hairs on his body standing up. It felt like a forbidden zone."If I cultivate here, my improvement will be very fast. Also, I'll be tempering myself at all times…" Xu Qing mumbled and quickly walked a few steps to find the 'Xuan' No.33.The location was a little remote and the surroundings were empty. There weren't many boats there.At this point, Xu Qing cautiously observed his surroundings. After confirming that there was nothing wrong, he took out a small bottle from the brocade box and opened it. A light flashed within the small bottle and the small boat inside flew out. When it landed on the water surface, it automatically enlarged.After the boat landed on the sea with a bang and created waves of ripples, what appeared before Xu Qing was a boat that was ten feet wide and thirty feet long.Its entire body was pitch-black and a large number of runes were carved on every plank. As it emitted a dark glow, it also emitted spirit energy fluctuations. It was very extraordinary.The black tent seemed to be made from the skin of some mutated beast. Its scales were clear and looked very sturdy. There was also a statue at the bow of the boat.This statue had the head of a gigantic crocodile. It opened its ghastly mouth and revealed sharp teeth. Amidst its ferocity, there was intense cruelty.From afar, this small boat looked like a giant crocodile floating on the sea.

Chapter 86 Using The Sea As Cultivation Base (1)
The moonlight cascaded down, covering the giant crocodile's body in a layer of moonlight. From afar, it looked like the ship was alive and was absorbing the essence of the moon, as though it was breathing.This caused the moonlight to be even more intense as it was absorbed. Amidst the flowing light, the cold light was revealed.Xu Qing stared at it for a long time.Whether it was his life in the slums or the scavenger campsite, other than the new house that Captain Lei had given him, the places he lived in were mostly crude.As for this crocodile-like boat, it was clean and tidy under the moonlight. There was a sharpness to it and Xu Qing couldn't help but squat down and touch it.It was cold and hard.The most important thing was how it was his."This is mine," Xu Qing said softly. Just when he was about to step forward, he paused for a moment. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he sensed a gaze filled with malice staring at him from the surroundings.However, the other party had hidden himself very well and Xu Qing wasn't able to find him in a short period of time. Hence, he retracted the cold glint in his eyes and maintained his calmness from before, pretending to look down at his shoes.The straw shoes were very worn-out and were mixed with a large amount of mud and dried blood. His dirty toes could be seen through the gap.After a moment of silence, Xu Qing took off his shoes and looked at his feet which were covered in dirt. He then sat at the side and stretched his hands into the seawater, rinsing his feet until his fair skin was revealed.Throughout the entire process, he seemed calm but he was secretly observing the surroundings, waiting for the person with malicious intent to appear. However, the other party seemed to be very cautious. Even when Xu Qing sat there and revealed a hint of laziness, the person didn't appear.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He got up and stepped onto the boat, glancing at the black canopy.The space inside the black tent wasn't big and the interior was very simple. There was only a bed, a futon, and a bathroom.In addition, the roof of the black tent was a little short. Ordinary people wouldn't be able to stand completely but it should be very suitable for sitting down. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  After Xu Qing swept his gaze across the surroundings, he didn't step into it. Instead, he sat on the deck of the boat outside the black tent and listened to the clear waves outside. He could feel the small boat swaying with the waves.In this relative silence, his gaze seemed to drift, as though his thoughts were slowly dispersing.Xu Qing thought of his struggling life in the slums back then. He thought of the cold nights he spent hiding in his little nest. Every winter, he would be in the cold, wondering if he could see the sun the next day.This was because someone would freeze to death every winter.Therefore, he was very afraid of the cold. Perhaps what he was afraid of wasn't the cold in his body but his memories.At that moment, he sat silently on the boat. Xu Qing looked at the dark night outside and the bright moon in the sky. He recalled the first person he killed many years ago.That person wanted to eat him. In the end, he laboriously cut off his head and placed it at the entrance of his little nest. From then on, the way everyone looked at him changed. The boat was still swaying.The thoughts in Xu Qing's eyes seemed to be drifting away but he was mumbling in his heart."Should I place one here as well?"The instant the voice rang out in his heart, Xu Qing's body abruptly leaned back as a cold light whistled past him.The instant he dodged the cold light, the fleeting light in Xu Qing's eyes vanished. It was as though everything was fake and the coldness that was truly hidden within broke out at this moment!"He finally showed himself!"At the next moment, the seawater beside the boat suddenly splashed up as a figure suddenly rushed out, heading straight for Xu Qing. There was also a sharp cold glint that flashed from the right hand of this figure.It was a dagger that glowed blue under the moonlight. It had been smeared with poison.With the help of the moonlight, Xu Qing could see who it was. It was a disciple wearing a gray Daoist robe. He didn't cover his face and looked to be in his thirties. He was only at the fifth level of Qi Condensation but he gave Xu Qing a sense of threat.At that moment, this disciple's expression was malevolent and killing intent filled his eyes.His speed was so fast that he got close in an instant. The dagger in his hand then stabbed fiercely toward Xu Qing's chest.Xu Qing's gaze was ice-cold. He ignored the other party's dagger and stretched out his right hand at an even faster speed, grabbing the incoming person's arm. As the body-refining energy in his body erupted, he abruptly rotated his body, instantly lifting the body of the cultivator who was rushing over.Under the shock and disbelief of this person, his body was smashed onto the ship's deck by Xu Qing.With a boom, blood splattered everywhere as a tentacle made of flesh and blood suddenly drilled out from the man's body. The tentacle then rapidly lashed out at Xu Qing with mucus trailing behind it. The aura it contained surpassed the fifth level of Qi Condensation, reaching the sixth level.Xu Qing's face was expressionless. The shadow behind him suddenly appeared and directly suppressed it.With a boom, the tentacle was instantly paralyzed and collapsed.After losing the tentacle, the cultivator spat out a mouthful of blood. His countenance instantly turned pale and he still wanted to struggle. However, in the next instant, Xu Qing's left hand grabbed a dagger and pressed it against the cultivator's neck.The dagger was very cold and it sliced through his skin. He only needed to exert a little force to slit his throat.This scene caused the cultivator's body to tremble. When he looked at Xu Qing, his gaze was filled with terror. "How did you hide yourself? Also, what were the tentacles on your body earlier?" Xu Qing coldly looked at the cultivator in front of him and asked."This is the Seal of the Sea's Hand that I've transplanted into my body. It can increase my combat strength and also allow me to hide my aura in the sea. Many people in the sect do this. Junior Brother, I can think of a way to make up for my actions this time. I don't have enough contribution points but I've accepted a mission. Tomorrow-" The cultivator hurriedly spoke but before he could finish speaking, the dagger in Xu Qing's hand slashed fiercely.

Chapter 87 Using The Sea As Cultivation Base (2)
Immediately, the eyes of this cultivator widened. Before he could let out a blood-curdling scream, he was pressed down by Xu Qing. As his body twitched, fresh blood gushed out, dying the spirit boat red.A few breaths later, his body remained motionless.Xu Qing looked at the dirty magic boat and frowned. He then took out the corpse-destroying powder and scattered it. Even after the corpse had turned into blood water, there were still no disciples from the Seventh Peak in the surroundings.It was as though everyone was used to this.At that moment, the sea breeze blew over, bringing with it the stench of the sea and blood, permeating the surroundings of Xu Qing. He then picked up the other party's bag. It was very empty and didn't contain any valuable items."This person has his eyes on me because I have a magic boat." Xu Qing recalled what the round-faced cultivator had said during the day. Every month, there would be disciples who would mysteriously disappear.Hence, he touched his sharp iron stick and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. After that, he took out the brocade box he had brought back and opened it. He found the jade slip that introduced boats and began to read it carefully.After a long time, Xu Qing slowly put down the jade slip. He then lowered his head and stared at the ship with a strange glint in his eyes."This boat is very astonishing." As he muttered, Xu Qing lifted his right hand and patted the deck of the boat beside him. The spirit energy in his body spread out and according to the method on the jade slip, he transformed his spirit energy into a mark and imprinted it on the boat.The entire ship trembled as though some device had been activated, emitting a soft buzzing sound.Xu Qing immediately bit his finger and squeezed out a drop of blood. After that, he seriously drew a simple rune on the ship's deck. As the rune was drawn, the entire ship trembled with a bang. A mysterious connection instantly appeared in Xu Qing's mind.This was the method recorded in the jade slip for the ship to recognize its master. After he finished operating it, Xu Qing could clearly feel that he and the ship had become one.With a thought, a protective light barrier instantly appeared on the ship. After enveloping the entire ship, Xu Qing finally felt a sense of security.Hence, he lowered his head and continued to look at the jade slip regarding the ship. After he repeated the contents of the jade slip many times, he firmly imprinted them in his heart.The Seven Blood Eyes' boat indeed contained extremely high growth potential.Disciples could strengthen it according to their needs in the four aspects of speed, defense, attack, and uniqueness. They could either strengthen it individually or have it bloom in all aspects. It depended on the level of their resources and their preferences.The first three directions were simple and easy to understand. As for what was unique, it referred to special abilities other than spells. For example, it could allow a boat to dive to the bottom of the sea or allow it to leave the surface of the sea and fly in the sky.Or perhaps, there were some changes where his form was different from the ship.However, regardless of whether it was the uniqueness or the other three directions, there was only one thing that determined them and that was the material of the ship.Generally speaking, there were two directions for the Seventh Peak's disciples to choose the ship's material. The first direction was having the boat be man-made.They would constantly put higher-level materials, allowing them to withstand more powerful array formations, allowing the ship to advance and become more powerful.This path required one to cooperate with the Second Peak's formation training. In the future, there would be human limitations but it was still the first choice for a considerable portion of disciples. This was because this path wasn't too dangerous. It was a step-by-step method that followed the rules."As for the second direction…""That's using the body materials of mutated creatures as the material for the ship. There's no need for an array formation to be added." Xu Qing had some understanding. Through the jade slip on the ship, he knew that all the materials on mutated creatures contained natural array formations.It could also be said that its talent and might were extraordinary. This type of array formation was known as a restriction.Different mutated beasts' bodies contained different restrictions and different abilities."No matter which direction I go, it will consume a lot of resources." Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at the jade slip in his hand. He once again realized how terrifying the Seven Blood Eyes were. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  This was because as a new disciple, the boat he exchanged for was only a Level One boat.As for the boats of the Seventh Peak, they were divided into four major levels: Canoe, Boat, Fleet and Wheel. Each level was divided into ten smaller layers.In fact, after the wheel, the jade slip even stated the existence of an extreme level.It was called Big Wings."Under the layers of improvement, the resources required…" Xu Qing couldn't make any concrete calculations. His initial judgment was enough to make him gasp.Hence, he put down the jade slip and fell into a daze. He then lowered his head and looked at his pocket. Regardless of whether it was the leather pouch or the storage pouch, the remaining resources inside were simply too little."I have to think of a way to earn money. There's still a month before I have to pay a fee for a berth." Xu Qing muttered to himself. After a while, he took out another jade slip and started studying it.This jade slip recorded a cultivation art that the Seventh Peak didn't impart to outsiders. It was called the Sea Transformation Art.As a top-notch faction in the Nanhuang Continent, the cultivation arts of the various peaks were extremely valuable, be it the degree of separation of anomalous substances or their might. In terms of might, it was even more astonishing. It wasn't something that other small factions and families could compare to.It could be said that with the same cultivation, the difference was as great as the difference between fireflies and torches.After studying them carefully, Xu Qing let out a deep breath. He finally understood why all the Seven Blood Eyes disciples he saw after he came here gave him a sense of crisis despite their cultivation not being very high. The level of the cultivation technique determined everything.For example, this Sea Transformation Art had a total of ten levels, corresponding to the ten levels of Qi Condensation. When cultivating, one had to be near the sea. It would be even better if one was in the sea.For every level of cultivation, one would absorb the aura from the sea, forming a 100-foot-wide spirit sea in one's body. After cultivating to the tenth level, one would reach the great circle of Qi Condensation and the spirit sea could reach the upper limit of 1000 feet.

Chapter 88 Using The Sea As Cultivation Base (3)
This caused the cultivators who cultivated the Sea Transformation Art to have an extremely long lifespan. The spirit energy in their bodies surpassed their peers by several times. Coupled with the endless variations of spells, their combat strength could naturally suppress the surroundings.What was even stranger was that when he attacked, the aura of the forbidden sea contained in his spirit sea could also form mental pressure, causing his opponent to be weakened.The Qi Condensation Realm was the accumulation of spirit energy in one's body. Moreover, the aura of the forbidden sea in the Huahai Scripture could cause all people with inferior spirit energy to be intensely intimidated."The Mountains and Seas Art is a body-refining cultivation art. When one has mastered the Kui Shadow Art, it's equivalent to the great circle of perfection in body-refining. It's the same as the great circle of Qi Condensation. However, due to the level of the cultivation art, when compared to other high-level cultivation arts, the same great circle of perfection is much weaker.""However, because I don't have anomalous substances in my body and I have the support of the purple crystal, the seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art gave me the shadow of a great circle of perfection. My battle prowess is comparable to a person in the great circle of perfection.""At the end of the day, the level of the Mountains and Seas Art can't be compared to this Sea Transformation Art. One is a body-refining technique, while the other is a cultivation technique…" Xu Qing's heart stirred as he recalled what the round-faced cultivator had said on the mountain earlier.A long time later, Xu Qing's gaze revealed determination. He also noticed that the upper limit of the spirit sea formed by the Sea Transformation Art wasn't fixed.Everyone's physique was different and so was the degree of mutation.The lesser the mutation, the greater the upper limit of the spirit sea's range. So far, the highest record in the Seven Blood Eyes was 60 years ago when someone reached the great circle of Qi Condensation and formed a spirit sea of 2,700 feet.This person was the current peak master of the seventh peak of the Seven Blood Eyes.Upon seeing this, Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He knew that there were no anomalous substances in his body…"Then, when I cultivate this Sea Transformation Art, how big of a spirit sea will be formed after I reach perfection?"At this moment, Xu Qing's heart was filled with intense anticipation. He felt that if the mutation no longer stopped the upper limit, then his upper limit should be the greatest limit he could endure.Moreover, his body's recovery was very terrifying, so the extent of his endurance would naturally be extremely great.This caused Xu Qing's eyes to shine with unprecedented brilliance.At the same time, he also noticed that the Sea Transformation Art cultivated spells and not body refinement. After the battle with the Diamond Sect, Xu Qing deeply realized the flaw of pure body refinement.Therefore, at this moment, he didn't hesitate at all. After carefully memorizing the cultivation technique, he immediately closed his eyes and began to cultivate the Sea Transformation Art.As he cultivated, the wind started blowing around the small boat. The surface of the sea sparkled as countless spirit energy that contained the aura of the forbidden sea mixed with dense anomalous substances headed straight for Xu Qing's small boat.The protective light barrier could block spells but it wouldn't block the spirit energy. As the spirit energy gushed in, it drilled into the hair on Xu Qing's body, forming threads.After his body that didn't have any anomalous substances was refined many times, all of his meridians became incomparably clear. This allowed the influx of spirit energy to have no obstruction at all and it became increasingly violent.His body was like a dried sponge, instantly absorbing the spirit energy and slowly gathering it at his dantian.During this cultivation, Xu Qing faintly sensed that his Mountains and Seas Art seemed to be attracted by the Sea Transformation Art and instinctively wanted to circulate it. However, because the flowing meridians were different, he suppressed them.A long time later, as the urge to circulate the Mountains and Seas Art grew increasingly intense, Xu Qing's heart stirred. After a moment of silence, he decided not to control it anymore. At the next instant, the unsealed Mountains and Seas Art circulated and the spirit energy that gushed in from all directions suddenly soared by several times. The spirit sea that gathered in his dantian instantly became majestic.This discovery made Xu Qing feel somewhat incredulous.It was as though these two cultivation arts had fused at this moment. Among them, the Mountains and Seas Art wasn't fighting against the Sea Transformation Art but was a supporting art.Hence, he decided to expand the vital energy and blood in his entire body and the shadow appeared outside his body.The moment it appeared, the shadow let out a soundless roar toward the sky. It then stretched out its hands as though it was moving the sea, causing the spirit energy in the forbidden sea to erupt like a surging tide.In that instant, as Xu Qing's mind trembled, the spirit sea in his dantian directly reached a hundred feet.The first level of the Sea Transformation Art was perfected.Xu Qing's body trembled. He didn't have time to think too much and immediately cultivated the second level. Not long later, the second level of the Sea Transformation Art was perfected."So fast!" Xu Qing didn't hesitate and immediately cultivated to the third level.The spirit sea in his body continued to expand. 210 feet, 220 feet, 230 feet…Under this continuous eruption, even the spirit energy outside his small boat gradually formed a vortex, causing the wind here to be even stronger. Waves appeared on the surface of the sea, attracting the attention of the guards on the shore.They all stared at it and their expressions changed."Which monstrous disciple is cultivating?""This speed of absorbing spirit energy…" no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  The instant they looked over in shock, the vortex suddenly rumbled and expanded once again, causing the surface of the harbor to undulate even more. A large number of boats swayed along with it and many disciples frowned as they walked out. They looked over coldly, and very soon, all of them had astonished expressions."What's going on!"The vortex was still expanding!In the boat, Xu Qing's entire body was trembling intensely. At that moment, the spirit sea in his body had broken through 300 feet and reached 370 feet.It continued.380 feet, 390 feet, up to 400 feet!Xu Qing abruptly opened his eyes. The piercing purple light within drowned out the shock in his eyes."Sea Transformation Art, the fourth level!"

Chapter 89 Butterfly Transformation
In the middle of the night, Xu Qing cultivated the Sea Transformation Art and broke through all the way to the fourth level.This speed was extremely exaggerated and it also caused the hearts of the Seventh Peak's disciples outside to tremble. However, most of the people on the Seventh Peak liked to hide their emotions.Hence, they noticed that Xu Qing's boat was a new one. After understanding that Xu Qing was a newly-promoted disciple, most of them returned to their boats. On the surface, they didn't pay attention to him anymore. Everything was normal but in reality, they had already begun to secretly probe.It was only when the sun slowly rose in the distant horizon and the sunlight landed on the surface of the sea, forming a piercing light that spread in all directions, that Xu Qing, who was in the small boat, opened his eyes.This time, the purple light in his eyes lasted for more than ten breaths of time before it slowly dissipated, revealing astonishment. Although his cultivation speed in the latter half of the night was much slower, he still managed to break through from the fourth level of the Sea Transformation Art to the fifth level.However, to reach such a level in a single night was also beyond Xu Qing's expectations."The Mountains and Seas Art and the Sea Transformation Art can complement each other." Xu Qing found it unbelievable.At this moment, he, who was sitting there, looked different from yesterday. His sharp edges and corners had become gentler.In fact, there was even a faint otherworldly temperament that was slowly developing.This was the aura brought about by the Sea Transformation Art.After sensing the 500-foot-long spirit sea in his body, Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and recalled the words of the Mountains and Seas Art.A xiao could move mountains, while a Kui could move seas.However, he carefully analyzed and judged in his heart. In the end, he felt that the reason for this was partly because of the Mountains and Seas Art but more so because the meridians in his body were clear and there were no abnormalities at all.It was like an incomparably sturdy container that had been forged. It wasn't something that a cultivator's body could compare to.That was why it was able to contain a large amount of spirit energy during the early stages. This also explained why the cultivation speed had decreased during the latter half of the night.The capacity of the container wasn't infinite."However, from the fact that I still managed to break through one level in the latter half of the night, although my cultivation speed has decreased, it can still support me to continue improving rapidly.Xu Qing thought about it and his eyes gleamed. That night, not only did he improve his Sea Transformation Art but his Mountains and Seas Art also improved by quite a bit.At that moment, he wasn't far from the eighth level.The most important thing was that every level of the Sea Transformation Art recorded spells. Hence, he lowered his head and looked at his right hand. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  With a thought, a drop of seawater rapidly formed in his palm. In an instant, it transformed into a water ball the size of a human head. It kept transforming, sometimes into a throwing knife, sometimes into a small shield, and sometimes into a bird.In his hand, the water ball was constantly changing. According to the different distribution of seawater, the focus of each item was different. Naturally, there were differences in their might.In the Sea Transformation Art's jade slip, there were no less than a hundred such changes recorded from the first level to the tenth level.At the same time that it emitted a chill, there was also an aura that belonged to the Forbidden Sea that could intimidate the enemy's mind. At the same time, in terms of might, Xu Qing could sense it slightly.The explosive power of this water ball was enough to intimidate all the fifth-level Qi Condensation cultivators he had seen on the scavenger campsite.Xu Qing weighed the situation. If he hadn't come to the Seven Blood Eyes, he would have been able to quickly kill all of them with less than 40 water balls.However, after sensing the 500-foot-long spirit sea in his body, he analyzed that he could release about 50 water balls. With such a number, if he was good at transformation, he would have to be extremely vigilant. Although he could still kill them, it would take a longer time.This was already very exaggerated. Xu Qing's Mountains and Seas Art seemed to be at 70% completion but compared to other people who cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art, his combat strength was equivalent to the tenth level. After all, he had mastered the Kui Shadow Grand Formation.In other words, those who cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art to the tenth level wouldn't be able to instantly kill a disciple at the fifth level of the seventh peak's Sea Transformation Art.All of this allowed Xu Qing's understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes to increase once again. He now had a deeper judgment of the endurance and strength of the Seventh Peak's disciples."The difference between rogue cultivators and sect disciples is too great.""At that moment, I'm confident that I can kill my past self within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn." Xu Qing muttered as his expression slowly lit up.Although his cultivation level didn't increase significantly, the increase in his combat strength made him feel that he was on the right path.At that moment in the morning, the sun's rays streamed into the cabin through the black canopy, forming Xu Qing's shadow on the deck. He then lowered his head and looked at the shadow.After a night of cultivation, all the anomalous substances were absorbed by the shadow. This caused his shadow to look even darker than before. If one were to take a closer look, it was as though the places it covered contained an abyss.At that moment, under Xu Qing's gaze, the shadow suddenly moved. As it swayed left and right, it stretched out its hands. After it clenched its fists, it spread out its fingers. This cycle repeated again and again and its speed became faster and faster.It even rapidly lengthened and shrunk, looking extremely strange.A long time later, as a hint of fatigue appeared on Xu Qing's face, the shadow instantly returned to its original state and stopped moving."After going through the second round of assessment and the breakthrough in the Sea Transformation Scripture, my control over my shadow has improved by leaps and bounds." Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the sun outside.A long time later, he slowly stood up. After tidying up his belongings, he took out the gray Daoist robe and placed it on the table before touching it gently. After that, he waved his right hand, and a drop of seawater was formed. After it swelled into a water ball, it flattened out and eventually turned into a water mirror that reflected Xu Qing's figure.The face in the water mirror had a hint of immaturity and was incomparably delicate, containing a unique charm. Although it was dirty, the spirit in its eyes was like the stars, very dazzling.Looking at his reflection in the water mirror, Xu Qing fell silent for a moment before a look of determination appeared on his face. He then removed his scavenger clothes, revealing his refined and perfectly proportioned body after cultivating the Mountains and Seas Art.He raised his left hand and grabbed at the water mirror. Immediately, the water mirror headed straight for Xu Qing. When it got close, it transformed into a large amount of water vapor that directly covered his entire body. As it was continuously rinsed, black-colored sewage flowed down his slender body and spread to the ground beneath his feet.Xu Qing calmly stood there. This was the first time in seven years that he had cleansed his body so thoroughly.This was because he knew that the current environment had changed. In the slums and scavenger camps, he, who was covered in dirt, was just like everyone else, so he wasn't conspicuous.However, here, if he was still the same as before, he would attract too much unnecessary attention. Although scavengers dressed like that would give people a feeling of poverty, the fact that he had a magic boat wasn't a secret. Anyone with a keen eye would know at a glance. So, if he still pretended to conceal it, it wouldn't mean much.Therefore, there was no change in his expression at all. He allowed the water vapor to wash over him and his fair skin was gradually exposed to a large area. This was the case for his face and hair.A moment later, when the last trace of dirt on his body dissipated, Xu Qing opened his eyes.The sunlight streamed into the black tent, falling on his black hair and his face. It was as though he was reluctant to leave and wanted to gently flow through his entire body. Xu Qing felt a little uncomfortable and took a few steps back, allowing his body to fall into the darkness.The shadow in the darkness had a head of shiny black hair.He looked to be about 16 or 17 years old. He had slanted handsome brows, slender and sharp black eyes, thin and lightly pursed lips, well-defined facial features and a slender figure. He was like an eagle that wanted to spread its wings in the dark night.He was cold, arrogant, and lonesome, yet he also exuded an imposing aura. He stood there alone and when combined with the remaining immaturity on the youth's face, it caused his entire body to emit astonishing charm.Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at his hands. He then took out the inner parts of the gray Daoist robe and wore them one by one.Finally, he changed into the shoes given by the sect and put on the Daoist robe. After that, he waved his hand and water droplets appeared once again, washing away the blood stains from last night until it was completely clean. After Xu Qing walked out of the boat, under the sunlight, his entire person glowed with an indescribable vigor.It was like a gem covered in dust had its dust wiped away, revealing a dazzling light.This caused many of the patrolling guards on the shore to glance over.Xu Qing stood on the boat and narrowed his eyes, as though he wanted to block out the gazes from the outside world. When the sunlight shone directly on his skin, it also made him feel a little uncomfortable. However, he understood that this was a necessary experience for him. Hence, Xu Qing slowly opened his eyes and forced himself to adapt.A long time later, he took a deep breath and turned to get off the small boat.With a wave of his hand, he kept the small boat into a bottle and slowly walked away under the gaze of the patrolling guards.Today was the day he was to report to the Homicide Division.At the same time, he also planned to head to the medicine shop at the port to buy some medicinal herbs used to refine white pills and poison powder. The medicinal pills he had on him were now empty.The port in the morning was very lively.The merchant ships from the outside world and the disciples of the Seventh Peak that came and went filled over a hundred harbors and caused the port to be bustling with activity. There were also many people coming and going. Most of the shops were also opening at this moment and the pedestrians on the streets also began their busy day.Xu Qing's arrival attracted some attention due to his appearance. However, to cultivators, looks were just appearances. Hence, most of them only took a glance before retracting their gazes.Xu Qing slowly got used to it. However, as he walked on the streets, he was still used to moving in the shadows. At the same time, on the way to the Homicide Division, Xu Qing also noticed that other than medicine shops, there were also some blacksmithing workshops and array carving shops.Through the jade slip of the magic boat, Xu Qing knew that not every disciple could refine a boat on their own. To the vast majority of disciples, they would usually send the materials and magic boats to the shops opened by the Sixth Peak's disciples or the array carving shops opened by the Fifth Summit's disciples to request for refinement.After paying attention to these shops, Xu Qing asked around and found out the location of Seventh Peak's Homicide Division. He then quickly walked over.Not long later, a magnificent building appeared before Xu Qing.The gate of this building was very similar to the city lord's residence he had seen before but the area inside was even larger. There were dozens of small buildings lined up and waves of pressure also spread out, suppressing the surroundings.This was especially so for the pitch-black statues. The two stone statues in front of the gate looked sinister, as though they were a combination of a human and a beast. They looked like rakshasas, and it was a shocking sight.It was cold and cheerless in front of the gate. Pedestrians would usually take a detour and avoid the area, not daring to get close.At that moment, at the entrance, there were two young cultivators dressed in gray Daoist robes. One was a man and the other was a woman. Both of them were in their twenties and had ordinary appearances. They were currently lazily leaning against the gatepost and yawning, as though they hadn't woken up. However, the instant Xu Qing walked over, the two of them immediately lifted their heads. Their gazes were like lightning as they landed on Xu Qing.Xu Qing's expression was calm as he walked over under the gazes of the two people. He wasn't too close and stopped at the entrance. He then cupped his fists and bowed."Disciple of the Seventh Peak, Xu Qing, is here to report for duty.""Newbie?" The young man's eyes gleamed darkly as he swept his gaze over Xu Qing. However, his eyes soon narrowed slightly as though he could sense the extraordinary fluctuations from Xu Qing. Just when he was about to speak, his female companion beside him pushed him aside and rushed to Xu Qing's side. She then revealed a gentle and beautiful smile when she saw Xu Qing's face."Junior Brother, what are you here for?""He already said that he's here to report. Why are you still asking?" The young man smiled faintly.The female cultivator didn't seem to hear this and continued to look at Xu Qing.Xu Qing instinctively took a few steps back. He didn't like to be too close to others, so he habitually observed the two of them. This was especially so when he instinctively cast a few more glances at the necks of the man and woman.

Chapter 90 The Strange Captain (1)
Sensing that the cultivation of these two people was at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, Xu Qing felt that they weren't a threat after some analysis. His current combat strength could allow him to kill them so his heart was calm. The youth seemed to have sensed Xu Qing's gaze and instinctively rubbed his neck. His expression then turned a little solemn. He felt that this newbie before him was different from the others.The female cultivator beside him also sensed it. Her eyes narrowed and revealed interest. She licked her lips and said to the youth:"Watch the door. I'll bring this little junior brother in." As she spoke, she revealed a sweet smile and personally led Xu Qing into the Homicide Department."Junior Brother, follow me."Xu Qing thanked her.The youth at the door shook his head slightly when he saw this scene."This flirt, is she going to ever change? Although this kid is a little different from the other newbies, it's hard to say if he can survive for more than three months in a place like the Homicide Department." no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  At that moment, Xu Qing maintained a certain distance from the people in the Homicide Department. He followed the woman in front of him and walked into the courtyard. All he saw were disciples wearing gray Daoist robes like him.All of them were at least at the fifth or sixth level of Qi Condensation. Among them, there were cultivators at the seventh or eighth level of Qi Condensation. Some were cold, some looked gentle, some smelled of blood, and some carried miscellaneous items in their hands, looking very ordinary.On the whole, it was hard to see any uniform aura despite belonging to the same division. Moreover, there was some distance between them, as though they were very resistant to getting close to each other.Xu Qing silently observed his surroundings. His gaze swept past the necks of every cultivator who passed by and he made a judgment in his heart about their combat strength and whether he could kill them.This was his instinct.Very soon, Xu Qing became even more vigilant because he discovered that many people were hard to kill. There were even a few who made him feel an intense threat.At the same time, he also began to pay attention to the structure of the Homicide Department and quickly sketched it out in his mind.At the same time, the woman in front suddenly retreated and moved closer to him as she laughed lightly."Junior Brother, why do you always like to look at other people's necks?"As she spoke, the woman had already arrived beside Xu Qing. She lifted her right hand and was about to touch Xu Qing's chest when her expression changed at the next instant. She retreated abruptly and took out a few medicinal pills before swallowing them. When she lifted her head and looked at Xu Qing, her expression froze."I don't like others getting close to me." Xu Qing calmly looked at the woman in front of him.The woman cast a deep glance at Xu Qing and nodded, putting away the thoughts in her heart. At that moment, she had already realized that this newbie in front of her wasn't simple."Interesting. A person like you might be able to live longer here." After saying that, the woman continued to lead the way. This time, it wasn't that Xu Qing wanted to keep a distance between them but the woman took the initiative to keep a certain distance from him and didn't continue to speak.Not long later, under the guidance of the woman, they made their way through seven to eight pavilions and a few small paths. Very soon, Xu Qing was brought to a large hall. The interior of the hall was pitch-black and it was a clear contrast to the sunlight outside. "Director, a newcomer has come to report. His name is Xu Qing." When the woman arrived, her expression became even more solemn. After she spoke loudly, she lowered her head and stood there motionlessly.Xu Qing also had a solemn expression as he lowered his head and waited.A long time later, in the pitch-black hall, it was as though two bright lights had instantly lit up. That was a pair of eyes. Its gaze penetrated the void and shot out from the hall, landing on Xu Qing.Being stared at by this gaze, Xu Qing's body trembled as he felt an intense pressure descend on his entire body. It was as though there was a ferocious beast that was so powerful that it made one feel suffocated in this hall.Xu Qing's hair stood on end and his breathing was hurried. His right hand subconsciously moved to his side and his body bent slightly.Fortunately, he quickly retracted his gaze. However, at that moment, before Xu Qing could catch his breath, the token in his left hand was instantly entangled by a strong force and broke free.With a whoosh, it headed straight for the palace.The force was so great that Xu Qing was unable to resist. He even felt that if the pulling force didn't land on the token but on him he would probably be directly dragged into the main hall.Xu Qing's forehead was covered in sweat. A long time later, a cold voice rang out from the main hall."Go and report to the Black Team Six."As his voice echoed, Xu Qing's identity token and badge shot out from the main hall at an extremely fast speed, instantly approaching Xu Qing.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he raised his hand and grabbed it. The impact from the token and badge was extremely great and gushed into his entire body, causing his upper body to involuntarily sway a few times. However, his legs were very stable and he didn't take half a step back.This scene caused the gaze in the hall to light up again. It didn't speak and it slowly closed its eyes again.The female disciple at the side narrowed her eyes when she saw Xu Qing's performance after receiving the token and badge."His level of vigilance is comparable to the elders in the sect and he also has such strength..." The woman blinked. Initially, after she sensed that Xu Qing wasn't someone to be trifled with, she had planned to not interact with him anymore. However, now that her thoughts had changed, she wanted to form a good relationship with him. Hence, she spoke up."Junior Brother Xu Qing, I'm familiar with Team Six. I'll bring you there." As she spoke, she gestured for Xu Qing to wear the badge.Xu Qing took a deep breath and wore the badge. He then cupped his fists toward the main hall and thanked the female disciple.Although he was young, his many years of experience made him very sensitive to the human heart.The attitude of this female disciple kept changing and he guessed the reason.In reality, that was indeed the case. On the way, the female disciple took the initiative to introduce herself to Xu Qing.
