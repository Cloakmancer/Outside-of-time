Zhang San examined Xu Qing's magic boat and sighed in resignation.Xu Qing thought about it and nodded. He didn't ask about how the other party was going to attempt Foundation Building. No matter how their relationship was, asking about such a thing would be infringing on other's privacy.He cupped his fists and bade farewell.It was already dark and the Seven Blood Eyes' teleportation array wouldn't be activated unless necessary. After some thought, Xu Qing didn't stay in an inn but went to the Homicide Department.After he was promoted to deputy captain, he also had a room in the Black Division. However, he rarely went there. Now that he didn't have a place to stay, Xu Qing planned to stay there for a night.After all, compared to the inn outside, the security in the Homicide Department was relatively higher.There was no one in the Black Division and the captain wasn't around either. Xu Qing entered his room and activated the protective array he had bought. He then closed his eyes and meditated.The night passed.The next morning, at dawn, Xu Qing opened his eyes. He put away the array formation and quickly left the Homicide Department, heading straight for the teleportation array in the center of the main city.He was very fast. Finally, an hour later, he saw the teleportation array from afar.There were quite a lot of people queuing up to use the teleportation array. Among them, two were quite conspicuous in the crowd. One was Zhang San, and the other was the captain on his back. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Xu Qing wasn't surprised since Zhang San had mentioned it yesterday. As for the captain who was looking left and right on Zhang San's back and was eating an apple, he saw Xu Qing and waved.As Xu Qing got closer, the captain swept his gaze over with a spurious smile."You don't dare to stay in the sect and want to find a place to break through outside? Do you want me to introduce a few places to you?"Zhang San also looked at Xu Qing and greeted him with a smile. When he heard the captain's words, his eyes lit up. He then glanced at Xu Qing a few more times with a look of joy on his face."I'm out on a mission." Xu Qing glanced at the queue and calmly spoke."Vice Captain Xu, your expression is a little fake. Let me teach you. In the future, when you want to lie, you have to look into the other party's eyes. Only then will it be more believable. Since you're concealing it so much, it seems like you gained a lot on the island?""Come, come, come. Take it out and let me see if it's as valuable as this apple."The captain finished the apple in his hand and took out a large apple that Xu Qing had given on Binding Island. He shook it proudly and took a bite."Mm, where are you going?" Xu Qing nodded and retracted his gaze from the teleportation array as he asked."Me? I'll go to recover. When I return, I'll be even more powerful. At that time, if you don't return the 10,000 spirit stones you owe me, don't blame me for being ruthless."The captain narrowed his eyes and cast a meaningful glance at the leather pouch on Xu Qing's body. He retracted his gaze and took a big bite of the apple."I wish you a smooth recovery, Captain." Xu Qing looked into the captain's eyes and said seriously.The captain started and looked into Xu Qing's eyes. A contemplative expression appeared on his face, as though he was analyzing the sincerity of Xu Qing's words.Zhang San sighed. He could tell that the captain and Xu Qing, these two lunatics, would probably chat like this every time they met. He was about to speak.However, at this moment, the sky of the entire Seven Blood Eyes suddenly changed. The originally clear sky instantly turned pitch-black. An incomparably shocking pressure caused the entire Seven Blood Eyes' main city to tremble. Even the seven mountain peaks shook under the pressure!Everyone in the main city, regardless of whether they were cultivators or mortals, felt their hearts pounding. They lifted their heads in unison and looked at the sky. Even the waves in the harbor stirred up huge waves, as though they were worshiping.Xu Qing's expression also changed. When he lifted his head, he saw the reason why the sky had turned black.It was a vast and endless black cloud that rushed over from the direction of the Phoenix Forbidden. When it passed above the Seven Blood Eyes, it covered the sun, causing the ground to turn pitch-black.This black cloud contained endless lightning that rumbled through the sky and swam in all directions. An incomparable deterrence spread out from the black cloud and enveloped all living beings.Everyone who saw it instinctively felt a sense of life-and-death crisis.There seemed to be a god-like existence hidden in the black clouds. It looked like a phoenix or an eagle!Its brown body was like a rock, and its feathers were like balls of flames.It seemed to be filled with anger as it aggressively headed in the direction of the Forbidden Sea. As it moved, the distant sea followed it. There were endless huge waves and monstrous sounds accompanying it.Just from the aura, Binding was clearly far inferior to it.As for Xu Qing, he only took a glance from afar but he already had a splitting headache and his mind was buzzing. The others in the surroundings were the same. Some of them even bled from their seven orifices.Xu Qing was shocked. He recognized the other party.The existence in this black cloud was none other than the emperor of the number one forbidden zone in the Nanhuang Continent, the Flame Phoenix, whom he had encountered when he returned from the sea!However, at that time, the other party seemed to be calm, so Xu Qing didn't feel such a splitting headache. Now, the Flame Phoenix was clearly filled with anger and the fluctuations of its emotions affected everything."The Flame Phoenix went toward the sea… Looks like something major is going to happen. Could it be that the emperor in the Corpse Forbidden has walked out of the forbidden region?"As the captain whispered softly, the black cloud whistled past the top of the Seven Blood Eyes. After it gradually left, the sky of the Seven Blood Eyes became clear again. However, everyone's hearts were still beating intensely. Xu Qing took a deep breath. The last time he returned, he had asked Zhang San about Flame Phoenix. He knew that this terrifying existence wasn't a vicious character. It would be asleep most of the time.It treated the human race and the nonhuman races equally. It even protected the living beings living in the Nanhuang Continent to a certain extent.That was why a portion of the human race had survived until now.A long time after the Flame Phoenix left, the Seven Blood Eyes gradually regained its operation. Xu Qing retracted his gaze and walked toward the teleportation array. He stepped in and his figure instantly disappeared."This kid doesn't trust me. Looks like he got something good this time. However, no matter how good it is, it won't be as amazing as my Binding flesh." The captain smiled proudly and patted Zhang San's head."Let's go, Zhang San. I'll bring you to eat meat."Zhang San sighed and thought to himself, 'Xu Qing isn't the only one who doesn't trust you. I don't trust you either.' However, when he thought of his many years of investment, he had no choice but to accept his fate.'The ones who were invested are all f*cking bosses!' Zhang San shook his head and carried the captain into the teleportation array.As Xu Qing, Zhang San, and the captain teleported away, the Seven Blood Eyes gradually returned to normal. It was just that… at some point in time, some haze had appeared in the sky.It was as though a storm was coming.

Chapter 202 Solo Cultivation Under The Lantern
Xu Qing was extremely cautious when choosing a place to build his foundation.He had many things to consider. For example, he had to determine if there were people secretly following him. He had to check if the place had powerful forces in the surroundings.He had to consider spirit energy in the place. It couldn't be too dense or too scarce.In addition, the location couldn't be close to the forbidden zone or the cities. The wilderness was the best choice.However, there weren't many places that met all these conditions.Finally, he had to consider if the place he chose according to his needs had been chosen by others before.All of this floated in his mind. He had also thought of the forbidden zone temple in the scavenger campsite but the surroundings were too dangerous. Also, that strange singing voice made Xu Qing hesitate. In the end, he gave up on it.The first place he went to was a Seven Blood Eyes branch city near Purple Earth. This place was in the hinterland of the human race's territory in the Nanhuang Continent. There were fewer forbidden zones and it was relatively safe.One issue was there were many and all kinds of people here.As the teleportation light disappeared, Xu Qing walked out of the array formation. He didn't leave the city immediately but found an inn. After vigilantly observing and resting for a night, he used the talisman to change his appearance and continued to teleport away.Just like that, he teleported seven to eight times in the next half a month. Every time, he would change his appearance and roughly traveled through the entire Nanhuang Continent before deciding that no one was following him.Xu Qing was finally able to heave a sigh of relief.His injuries had recovered by 70 to 80% in this half a month. His combat strength was now almost the same as when he was on Merfolk Island.The recovery of his injuries also allowed Xu Qing to head out of the city and search for a suitable place for Foundation Building in the wilderness.It was only after Xu Qing searched for another half a month that he finally found a good place.This place was a mountainous area in the southeastern region of the Nanhuang Continent.There were many mountains and jungles here. However, they weren't forbidden zones. Instead, they had miasma and marshes like a rainforest.This caused there to be very few nearby cities. The closest one would take seven to eight days to reach.There wasn't a dense amount of anomalous substances here but it was the same for spirit energy. As such, there weren't any large factions nearby. Although the overall situation wasn't very suitable, Xu Qing felt that this place was more suitable than the other places he had checked.The place he chose wasn't on the mountains but the depths of a jungle between two mountains.According to his previous jungle experience, Xu Qing found a place and started digging.The soil on the ground was soft and not easy to dig. Xu Qing used Sea Transformation Art to extract most of the water in the soil and dug a cave deep underground.The entrance was covered by him and he also scattered enough poison powder in the surroundings. Finally, he sat cross-legged in the cave and sensed his surroundings. He then took out the five sets of array formations he had bought and activated them all.He also activated an array formation that concealed aura and fluctuations. After doing all this, Xu Qing let out a deep breath.A sense of security that he hadn't felt in a long time surfaced in his mind."I'll advance to the Foundation Building here."Xu Qing looked at his storage bag. He had bought different amounts of food from different cities. They were enough for him to survive here for half a year.He didn't know how long it would take for him to reach Foundation Building, but Xu Qing had already made a plan. He would not go out or think about anything about the outside world in this time.He wanted his entire body and mind to be immersed in the breakthrough.However, Xu Qing felt that he still had two things to deal with first.He took out the black iron stick and performed a series of hand seals. Spirit energy surged in and ruthlessly suppressed the sleeping Diamond Sect's ancestor. Immediately, a blood-curdling scream rang out from the iron stick."Master, what's wrong? I was wrong, I was wrong. Don't kill me. Tell me what I did wrong and I'll make amends!"Xu Qing didn't bother to reply and continued with the suppression. He only stopped when the Diamond Sect's ancestor was extremely weak and unconscious.He was worried that the Diamond Sect's ancestor would interfere in the process of breaking through. Now that the latter was weakened so much, Xu Qing felt that there was no big problem.After that, he performed another series of hand seals and used layers of spirit energy to seal the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Only then did he store the iron stick.The shadow clearly sensed Xu Qing's actions and was trembling.Xu Qing expressionlessly looked at the shadow.The shadow trembled even more intensely. Finally, under Xu Qing's gaze, it suddenly began to tear itself apart, as though it was self-harming."Not enough."Xu Qing calmly spoke. The purple crystal power in his body transformed into suppression that descended viciously, causing the shadow to become increasingly dim. Only when it was about to completely collapse did Xu Qing stop and slowly speak."If I fail to reach the Foundation Building realm, I'll crush you to death before I die!"After saying that, Xu Qing didn't bother with the shadow anymore. He was completely relieved after weakening the two hidden dangers in his body. He finally took out the Spirit Breath Lantern and lit it.The dim light instantly spread out and enveloped Xu Qing.Normally speaking, every time such a protective magic tool was lit, it would consume its own energy. As such, cultivators would only activate it when they were breaking through to Foundation Building.Even though the Seven Blood Eyes was rich and imposing, it was the same. Most of the disciples would rent a spot in the Foundation Building place when they were about to break through. They wouldn't be as extravagant as Xu Qing.However, Xu Qing felt that there was no need.Even though he didn't plan to break through immediately and wanted to reach the limit of his spirit sea, lighting this Spirit Breath Lantern didn't cost him money. What it consumed was its own spirituality.Moreover, Xu Qing had already sensed that the spirituality of this lamp was quite sufficient. He then took out two jade boxes.One contained three Foundation Building Pills, while the other contained two.The former came from the captain, while the latter was obtained by Xu Qing from the storage bag of the unlucky merfolk who tried to breakthrough in the merfolk race's Foundation Building Pagoda.The other party's status was clearly very high. He should have eaten a few pills and planned to save two for later.After putting the five Foundation Building Pills to the side, Xu Qing revealed a satisfied expression.He took a deep breath and under the cover of the Spirit Breath Lantern's light, he closed his eyes and began to cultivate.Time slowly passed and very soon, seven days passed.During these seven days, Xu Qing was completely focused on his cultivation. As the Sea Transformation Art continued to circulate and the spirit energy in the surroundings rapidly surged over, the spirit sea in his body kept on growing.Its range grew larger and larger, from 2,900 feet to 3,400 feet!This range had already surpassed the highest record in the history of the Seventh Peak in the Seven Blood Eyes. One had to know that back then, Old Master Seventh had only reached 2,700 feet.Before Old Master Seventh, no one had reached this level. After 60 years now, Xu Qing made a new record in this unknown cave.The majesty of the 3,400-foot-long spirit sea was extremely astonishing. If Xu Qing manifested it, it would definitely cause a commotion in this jungle. In fact, if the Seven Blood Eyes knew about this, they would probably be completely shocked.However, although such an outcome would attract the attention of the Seven Blood Eyes, the risk would follow too… In the Seven Blood Eyes, where benefits served as cohesion, if such a dazzling achievement was revealed, the outcome would be hard to predict.Xu Qing didn't have any thoughts of revealing it. He only wanted to live well. He didn't care about reputation. He only cared that he could live a better life.In this cruel world, if one wanted to do this, they could only become stronger.He would kill all the enemies who threatened his life. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Naturally, if revealing his spirit sea could achieve some of his goals, Xu Qing would consider it.Otherwise, before he reached the level where he had the power to suppress everything, he would continue to restrain his sharpness and only show it at the moment of killing. That was his way of survival.Xu Qing took a deep breath and continued cultivating.Just like that, days passed. Every day, his spirit sea would increase by 100 feet as though there was no limit. This caused the excitement in Xu Qing's heart to intensify.3,500 feet, 3,700 feet…Seven days later, the spirit sea in Xu Qing's body reached 4,000 feet. This was already four times greater than the Seven Blood Eyes' ordinary great circle of perfection disciples'. Under the light of the Spirit Breath Lantern, one could see that Xu Qing's entire body had become crystalline. It was as though countless seawater was flowing in his body. In fact, the moisture in the surroundings had become increasingly dense."I can still reach higher!"Xu Qing opened his eyes and stopped cultivating to eat some food. He then checked the array formations and the poison powder scattered outside. After confirming that everything was normal, he rested for a moment before continuing to cultivate.4,100 feet, 4,200 feet, 4,300 feet…Three days later, the spirit sea in Xu Qing's body reached 4,700 feet. At this moment, he finally felt a piercing pain that indicated that his body was unable to withstand it.This piercing pain was like his body had become a water bag that was completely filled with water, stretching his body to the extreme as though it was about to split open.Xu Qing's breathing hastened slightly. After pondering for a moment, he gritted his teeth and continued to cultivate. This time, his speed clearly slowed down. The range he increased every day began to decrease, from 100 feet to 50 feet.Moreover, the further he went, the slower the increase. The feeling of bursting also became increasingly intense. Half a month later, he finally pushed the spirit sea in his body to an astonishing level of 5,000 feet.Such a level was horrifying. Xu Qing felt an unbearable, piercing pain from everywhere in his body, as though it was shattering. The purple crystal was frantically repairing him."I've reached my extreme limits…" Xu Qing muttered softly.He found it extremely difficult to even move. It was as though he was carrying mountains on his back. He felt extremely suppressed.Although the purple crystal was trying its best to heal him, Xu Qing was aware that this state couldn't be maintained for too long."Then… I'll begin Foundation Building!" Determination appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. Without the slightest hesitation, he picked up a Foundation Building Pill in front of him and swallowed it.Like water falling into a pot of oil, the 5000-foot-long spirit sea in his body suddenly exploded, forming astonishing waves that surged crazily toward various parts of Xu Qing's body.The first step of the Foundation Building, sensing, began!

Chapter 203 Bizarre Blows Out The Light
The breakthrough from Qi Condensation to Foundation Building was divided into three major stages.The first stage was to use all the spirit energy to probe the body for the location of the magic apertures. The cultivator had to find these hidden areas and firmly remember their locations. This concerned their future prospects.The quantity of the magic apertures mattered as well and it was the focus of the sensing stage. This process could be carried out many times with the help of Foundation Building Pills.This stage took up almost half of the time of the Foundation Building process.The second stage was to gather the power of the spirit sea and use it to break open the first magic aperture.After the opened magic aperture contained enough spirit energy, it would transform into a vortex that would give birth to the first wisp of magic power.Once the magic power was born, it would circulate through the entire body and modify the flesh and blood of cultivators, causing their life level to advance. This was the third stage.The cultivator could be considered to have stepped into Foundation Building realm when they completed these three stages!It sounded simple but in reality, to be able to complete these three steps required comprehensive preparation and a certain amount of luck.What Xu Qing was doing now was the first stage. As the 5,000-foot-long spirit sea in his body erupted, large waves rushed toward his entire body and began to search for his magic apertures.Magic apertures weren't acupuncture points, so their locations were different in different people's bodies due to the difference in aptitude.The density of his spirit energy allowed Xu Qing to last longer and use many methods to sense them. Right now, what he was preparing to use was the method named the strong probing method explained in Ding Xue's jade slip.The so-called strong probing method was to use all the spirit energy in one's body to spread throughout one's body and make use of the violent impact to reveal the locations of the magic apertures. This was the final method of many Qi Condensation disciples at this stage.However, to Xu Qing, he only needed a portion of his spirit energy to complete it.He didn't hope to find enough magic apertures with just one time of strong probing. He only wanted to familiarize himself with the method first. As such, he spread out 20% of his spirit sea, which was 1000 feet.Although it was only 20%, to ordinary Seven Blood Eyes disciples, this was already all they had.The 1000-foot-long spirit sea erupted from his dantian and flowed like a tide through the meridians, flesh, bones, and all other areas of Xu Qing's body.As it spread, his meridians were like rivers and the churning of his spirit sea was like sea dragons that passed by fiercely.As for the flesh, blood, bones, and internal organs outside his meridians, they were like dry fields. As they were nourished by the spirit energy, they began to sense and search.Very soon, he discovered that there were some fine vortices in some of his meridians. Their existence was extremely concealed and could only be detected after his meridians had completely swelled.Those vortices were like heavenly gates. When spirit energy permeated through them, they faintly revealed an extremely profound aura. After Xu Qing sensed these auras, he immediately understood that they were magic apertures.Not only did his meridians store such a mysterious aperture, but he also discovered some of them in the flesh, blood, and internal organs."91!" Xu Qing's eyes gleamed. As his first sensing ended, the spirit energy in his body slowly dissipated like the ebbing tide.According to the Foundation Building information he had obtained previously, what affected the perception of the magic apertures was anomalous substances. In theory, the limit number of magic apertures was 120. Generally speaking, discovering 80 was already considered good aptitude, and 90 was outstanding.Using the calculation that 30 magic apertures could form a ball of life fire, this meant that he could form three balls of life fire in the future.If Xu Qing didn't care about the quantity at this moment, he could immediately proceed to the second stage and break open a magic aperture to form a vortex that would birth magic power."However, there are no anomalous substances in my body. Why did I only sense 91 magic apertures?" Xu Qing pondered. A moment later, he felt that this might be related to the aptitude.Before the god arrived and when there were no anomalous substances in this world, cultivators didn't look at the purity of their bodies but their body's aptitude.However, now, aptitude was no longer important to the vast majority of sects and forces. Only the seeds that those large forces had high hopes for would have their aptitudes checked."My aptitude will determine that even if there are no anomalous substances in my body, there will still be magic apertures that are hidden too deeply and can't be found." Xu Qing fell into deep thought.He felt that it didn't matter if he couldn't find them right now. It also didn't matter if his aptitude was limited. As long as he had enough spirit energy, it wasn't impossible to find these hidden magic apertures.If he couldn't find them on the first try, he would try again for the second time or the third time. If he still couldn't find them, he would do it five times or six times.Xu Qing closed his eyes. After pondering, he split half of the remaining 4000 feet of spirit sea in his body.The 2000-foot-long spirit sea violently spread toward his entire body and he began to sense the magic apertures a second time.This density already far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators.Under this eruption, the meridians in his entire body instantly swelled up. His flesh, blood, and internal organs were filled with spirit energy, and it was the same for his bones. His entire body trembled intensely.The impact was too great. In an instant, five more magic apertures were revealed.The number of magic apertures sensed reached 96!The remaining spirit energy in the second sensing didn't dissipate. It was still rapidly searching amidst the violent impact.This principle was like blowing a balloon full, revealing the hidden spots on it. If the spots were hidden deeper, he would just have to fill the balloon even more. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt "I have enough spirit energy and Foundation Building Pills."Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. The remaining 2,000 feet of spirit sea in his body erupted before the second sensing ended.At this moment, a sudden change occurred!In the cave where Xu Qing was meditating, the Spirit Breath Lantern was originally burning as usual. The light from the fire enveloped Xu Qing and seemed to protect him from the surrounding darkness.However, at that moment, there seemed to be an invisible existence that turned into a chilly wind and blew at the fire of the Spirit Breath Lantern. Immediately, the flames swayed and showed signs of extinguishing.As it swayed, its light spread to the mud walls and the ground around the cave, revealing countless dark existences. They didn't have complete figures and couldn't be seen clearly. One could only see clusters of blurry illusory bodies.It was as though they existed in the gap between time and space and had no specific appearance.Usually, they were in a daze. Today, because Xu Qing's sensing had revealed its auras in the world they existed in, it instantly attracted them over.The world they were in seemed to be infinitely vast. An aura like Xu Qing's would often be revealed but they were very far from each other. What the aura attracted was often the bizarre entities near the aura.The flames of the Spirit Breath Lantern clearly suppressed them, causing them to be unable to pounce forward. However, their greed grew increasingly intense.This greed had already materialized into endless malice, causing Xu Qing to be able to sense it even with his eyes closed. This caused his mind to shake.He didn't know what they were.The Foundation Building jade slips didn't state it explicitly, but he was very clear that if he was invaded by these malice, his Foundation Building would definitely fail.Fortunately, the Spirit Breath Lantern might be ordinary, but it wouldn't be extinguished easily. Although it was swaying violently, the light still enveloped Xu Qing's body.Xu Qing took a deep breath. He knew that he couldn't waste time. At this moment, he circulated the spirit sea in his body and sensed the location of the magic apertures again.Amidst the rumbling, seven more magic apertures were found, reaching 103!He was only 17 away from the limit of 120 theoretical magic apertures!"Again!" Xu Qing gritted his teeth fiercely. The spirit sea in his body spread out, forming tides that continuously impacted his entire body.Cracking sounds suddenly rang out as four more hidden magic apertures appeared!107!At the same time, there were more and more bizarre shadows in the surroundings. They let out soundless roars and rapidly surrounded Xu Qing. They also continuously blew chilly wind at the Spirit Breath Lantern, causing the flames of the Spirit Breath Lantern to sway even more intensely, as though they could be extinguished at any moment.Xu Qing didn't bother with these. He opened his eyes and swallowed a Foundation Building Pill. Immediately, spirit energy exploded in his withered spirit sea, erupting with astonishing spirit energy fluctuations.He didn't hesitate and spread the spirit energy throughout his body, causing him to feel an intense sense of expansion. It was as though his body was being stretched infinitely at this moment.As boundless spirit energy gushed in, three magic apertures that he hadn't discovered before instantly appeared amidst the rumbling of his body.110 apertures!Xu Qing's breathing was hurried. He lifted his hand and grabbed the box of Foundation Building Pills. He then swallowed all three Foundation Building Pills in one go.His body rumbled and the three Foundation Building Pills transformed into three violent sea dragons that ran amok in his body. His body seemed to be unable to hold on anymore. When it swelled to the extreme, extremely concealed magic apertures were revealed one after another.111, 113, 115…Until 118!At that moment, Xu Qing only had two more magic apertures to go before he would be able to reach the limit. However, just as he was completely immersed and searching inch by inch as though his body was magnified, because his senses had found too many magic apertures and the aura he emitted was too dense, the bizarre entities he attracted were countless times greater than before.When others broke through, they could at most sense around 90 something. As for Xu Qing… he was infinitely close to the end.Such a dense aura was like a huge torch in the dark night. The temptation was too great.The quality of the replica Spirit Breath Lantern wasn't good, persisting until this point was already its limit. After all, it had never protected a cultivator like Xu Qing before.The swaying of the flames suddenly became incomparably intense. In the end, amidst an astonishing gust of chilly wind… it was extinguished!

Chapter 204 Canopy Over Life! (1)
The instant it was extinguished and the flames in the surroundings disappeared, the countless bizarre entities in the surroundings seemed to emit ear-piercing sharp laughter. They carried unprecedented greed and desire as they pounced toward Xu Qing from all directions.However, in that instant, a light that was much more dazzling than the Spirit Breath Lantern from before shone. It was like the bright moon as it illuminated everything.It was as though the world had lit up!All the bizarre entities let out mournful cries. They directly turned into ashes and dissipated.A lantern that looked like a burning inverted black umbrella appeared in front of Xu Qing!It was the life lantern, a supreme treasure that he had obtained in the merfolk island.The lantern wasn't lit. The light came from the life lantern itself. It looked like it was burning but it wasn't.Even so, the light was still astonishing. The bizarre shadows were like moths to the fire, dying as they pounced upon Xu Qing. After most of them dissipated, although there were still remnants, they were clearly afraid and didn't dare to approach.While this happened, Xu Qing found some clues in his heart. At the next instant, his spirit energy surged in toward the heart, his mind buzzed and his body trembled intensely but he finally found the location of the last two magic apertures!120 apertures!In the history of Seven Blood Eyes, no one had been able to sense 120 magic apertures. And the location the magic apertures could only be sensed at the moment of Foundation Building.Therefore, the number they sensed at this stage basically determined how far they could go.In fact, it wasn't just the Seven Blood Eyes. It was rare for such a person to appear in the vast majority of sects and forces.As such, the jade slip Xu Qing obtained had referred to the 120 apertures as the theoretical limit. As for what would happen after reaching it, there was no explanation.However, after Xu Qing sensed all 120 magic apertures, he actually felt a sense of clarity. This feeling allowed him to faintly understand that 120… wasn't the limit.As for those magic apertures, he couldn't sense them now. He needed to truly open all 120 of them before he could explore those concealed magic apertures.However, he had a faint feeling that every magic aperture after 120 would be like a sprint. Every time he found another one in the future, it would cause a tremendous change to his body.Xu Qing drew in a deep breath. He was strongly anticipating it but he knew that now wasn't the time to think about this matter. He would leave it for the future."Then, let's begin the second stage, opening the first magic aperture of Foundation Building!" Xu Qing grabbed the air, grabbing the last Foundation Building Pill.He swallowed it.Immediately, the spirit sea in his body erupted again, forming a new tide that rushed toward the first magic aperture he discovered in his body.Xu Qing suddenly felt an extremely strong impact. He felt as though he had been knocked down by a giant beast flying at high speed. At the moment his body was about to collapse, the first magic aperture in his body opened! n(0)velbIn[.]nEt It was as though the world had been split open!The magic aperture he opened transformed into a bright point of light with flames forming inside. As a large amount of spirit energy surged in, it transformed into a vortex.As it rumbled and rotated, the aura in his body underwent a drastic change. Flames rose and as they continued to spread, a wisp of bright thread of fire that seemed to be highly compressed slowly rose from the vortex.This thread-like existence was… the magic power of a Foundation Building cultivator!This wisp far surpassed the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm by far. They were at different levels.As it continued to rise, it emitted a dazzling light and erupted with astonishing heat, causing Xu Qing's body to be illuminated.As for the spirit sea vortex in Xu Qing's magic aperture, it far surpassed an ordinary cultivator's as his spirit sea had reached 5,000 feet when he was in Qi Condensation. This advantage would be greatly displayed when he was at the Foundation Building realm.His magic aperture could accommodate the vortex formed by the 5000-foot-long spirit sea. The magic power produced by this was much denser.The instant this magic power appeared and Xu Qing's aura changed, the magic power instantly circulated rapidly in Xu Qing's body. Wherever it passed, his body would undergo earth-shattering changes.Firstly, his meridians. As the magic power circulated, his meridians became even more tenacious. One could even faintly see natural runes forming in his meridians.After that, it was flesh and blood. Similarly, as magic power rapidly permeated his body, they changed inch by inch. In fact, if one were to zoom in, they would be able to see that all the matters that formed his flesh and blood had undergone intrinsic changes.Next were his bones and internal organs. All the areas were now rumbling. His bones had become even harder and there were also runes on them. Even his internal organs were the same.This was… a magic body!The moment a cultivator stepped into Foundation Building, it was like a leap in life level, turning ordinary into magic!As the magic body was formed and magic power spread out, a fluctuation that far exceeded Qi Condensation erupted from Xu Qing's body. When it spread everywhere, Xu Qing opened his eyes, revealing a dazzling purple light.He recalled that the Foundation Building jade slip had said that disciples who cultivated the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale could open their second magic aperture faster than others when they were at the Foundation Building realm.When they reached the Foundation Building realm and opened their second magic aperture, they would have an additional opportunity to improve their body compared to others. This kind of thing would only happen at the instant they reached the Foundation Building realm. It wouldn't be like this when they opened other magic apertures in the future.

Chapter 205 Canopy Over Life! (2)
This opportunity was very precious. Moreover, this magic aperture would become his second natal aperture!Xu Qing waved his hands fiercely. Immediately, the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale reformed outside his body.Its size had been compressed to the extreme, transforming into a fist-sized body. After Xu Qing opened his mouth and swallowed it, the plesiosaur in his body let out a joyous roar and charged toward Xu Qing's second magic aperture!A boom echoed out as the second magic aperture was opened!The plesiosaur rushed in and transformed into a 5000-foot-long spirit sea vortex. As flames rose, a second magic power thread also emerged from the burning sea!After the second magic power thread appeared, it also flowed through Xu Qing's entire body, strengthening his magic body once again.At the same time, the bizarre shadows in the surroundings seemed to be extremely tempted by this. They got closer again and tried to suppress the black umbrella lantern, but they couldn't do it.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ However, an unprecedented chilly wind blew over like a storm. It was as though the great evil among the bizarre shadows had been attracted and blew fiercely at the fire.Although it was still unable to blow out the life lantern, it still dimmed it for a moment. Taking advantage of the dimness, this invisible great ferocious beast excitedly let out a soundless roar and sent a wisp of phantom toward Xu Qing, instantly approaching and wanting to rush into the space between Xu Qing's brows.However, as the life lantern shone, this phantom had no choice but to give up. It could only shrink back reluctantly.However, at the next instant, the lifeless shadow on the ground that Xu Qing had suppressed earlier seemed to have smelled a delicious aura and suddenly rushed toward the phantom.Before the phantom could retract, it was instantly approached by the shadow. It opened its mouth as though it was eating snacks and directly swallowed it.Amidst the roars of the unknown great ferocious beast, it burped in satisfaction. After that, it looked at Xu Qing with a hint of ferocity.However, in the end, it shivered a few times, as it recalled too many memories of being suppressed. It didn't dare to make a move. After it returned to Xu Qing's feet, it put on a lifeless and fragmented appearance and lay there in boredom.As for the bizarre entities in the surroundings, they all paused for a moment. It was as though there was an additional shark in the school of fish. They instantly retreated in unison and disappeared.Xu Qing suddenly opened his eyes and glanced at the shadow.The shadow trembled and there were even more cracks on it. It was unknown if they were real or fake…Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. After he retracted his gaze, he checked his body. At that moment, his magic body had been augmented again. A rumbling sound filled his surroundings. That was the sound of his heart beating.It was like the beating of war drums.As for the second wisp of magic power, it quickly fused with the first wisp of magic power and transformed into a thread.This thread of magic power caused flames to fill Xu Qing's body. The flames in the two magic apertures in his body burned his spirit sea and magic power continued to form and gather, illuminating everything in his body. After it illuminated all the areas in his body, it spread out.The strength of his aura was much stronger than before. There was no way to compare them at all. That was the difference in levels. In fact, when Xu Qing compared himself to the Foundation Building cultivators he had encountered, there was a considerable gap between them from the magic apertures alone.The magic apertures in their bodies were clearly not as dazzling as Xu Qing's."The goal of opening the magic apertures is to cultivate the life fire. 30 magic apertures can form a ball of life fire!""When the life fire is formed, it will be the true early-stage Foundation Building. The second ball of life fire will be the mid-stage…""Only by forming a life fire can I unleash the signature ability of a Foundation Building cultivator, the Mystic Brilliance Form!" Xu Qing muttered. Through the Foundation Building jade slip, he knew that after Foundation Building cultivators obtained a life fire, they usually wouldn't ignite it unless necessary.This was because in the Mystic Brilliance Form, the consumption was extremely terrifying.However, at the same time, after activating the Mystic Brilliance Form, their combat strength would be astonishing.Therefore, almost all Foundation Building cultivators who had formed their life fire would only activate their Mystic Brilliance Form to kill enemies during battle. Even if they didn't activate their Mystic Brilliance Form, they were still very powerful with their spells and magic body."From the looks of it, the Diamond Sect's ancestor did not finish opening 30 magic apertures. That's why the battle back then progressed like that… I have to open 30 magic apertures as soon as possible!"Xu Qing's eyes revealed intense vigilance and anticipation. He was vigilant because Foundation Building cultivators weren't as simple as he thought. He was looking forward to the formation of his life fire in the future and the activation of the Mystic Brilliance Form. At the same time, he also had… a life lantern!"A life lantern that all cultivators from large sects and factions desire. One lantern contains two balls of life fire. However, if I want to use it, I have to form the first ball of life fire before I can ignite it in my body.""After I cultivate the first ball of life fire and place it on the life lantern, making the life fire have a foundation, I'll be able to display the power of two balls of life fire. I'll be able to suppress all my peers at the early stage and fight against those at the middle stage. Moreover, according to the density of my magic apertures, I'll be able to activate Mystic Brilliance Form longer than others!"Xu Qing's gaze was like lightning. He looked at the black umbrella life lantern in front of him. After he picked it up, the light in his eyes became even more intense under the illumination of the life lantern."I have to store the life lantern first, it's the safest to keep it in my body."Xu Qing mumbled. The magic power in his body spread out from the two magic apertures. After it enveloped the life lantern in his hand, the lantern strangely turned transparent and fused with Xu Qing's magic power.As his magic power returned, Xu Qing immediately felt that this life lantern that looked like a black umbrella had appeared in his dantian. The umbrella canopy that seemed to contain some sort of profundity slowly opened and closed. Every time it opened and closed, a baleful aura would spread from it.After the life lantern opened and closed several times, it froze and fused with Xu Qing's body. An ancient feeling of time took root in Xu Qing's body.​ The black umbrella was faintly discernible above Xu Qing's head, like a canopy. As its light fell, it emitted waves of protective intent, causing Xu Qing's mind to be incomparably calm.His magic apertures were also enhanced. The speed at which his spirit sea rotated was even faster, and the formation of magic power also accelerated.In fact, there was even a hint of the aura of the black umbrella within the magic power. It exuded an ancient feeling and heat, spreading throughout Xu Qing's entire body, causing his body to feel extremely hot. Even his clothes turned to ashes at this moment.The heat spread to the outside. The cave instantly dried up and cracked, and the water outside evaporated in the blink of an eye. Trees spontaneously combusted and turned into ashes. At the same time, this heat continued to spread in all directions until it enveloped the whole jungle.Endless clouds of fog rose and dried-up cracks appeared on the ground. All the trees turned to ashes. The affected area was more than 30,000 feet!The land became so dry that it seemed to have been exposed to the sun for a hundred years!In the center of the dry land, the soil in Xu Qing's cave had already turned into black crystals from the high temperature. Xu Qing was sitting with eyes closed and had a calm expression on his face.If other Foundation Building cultivators could see Xu Qing's body, they would be extremely shocked. This was because when compared to their very small magic apertures, Xu Qing's magic apertures were astonishingly large. There was also a large black umbrella in his body that protected his soul.The black umbrella shone brightly, illuminating his entire body from the inside out. It was as though the heavenly palace was about to be revealed.After a long time, Xu Qing opened his eyes.

Chapter 206 Leaving Ordinary
As he opened his eyes, the heat within a radius of 30,000 feet boiled, and hot mist surged toward the sky, vaguely transforming into the appearance of a black umbrella, suppressing and hiding the fluctuations here.This made sure that no one could sense the situation here. However, all the wild beasts in the nearby areas were trembling.All of them were lying on the ground, not daring to move at all.On one hand, it was due to Xu Qing who had already stepped into the Foundation Building realm, and the pressure formed by the Foundation Building realm was quite oppressive. On the other hand, it was the life lantern in Xu Qing's body!It was unknown what this life lantern had experienced in the past, but its murderous aura was extremely strong.According to the captain back then, only a cultivator with the bloodline of the ancient kings and sovereigns and who cultivated emperor-level cultivation art could form a life lantern.Even in that era when god's fragmented face had not appeared, such people were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. Any one of them could suppress a territory. The only people who could fight against them were other cultivators who also possessed the bloodline of the ancient kings and sovereigns and condensed their life lanterns.The arrival of the god's fragmented face caused most of the ancient kings and sovereigns to leave. As such, it was extremely rare for someone to form a life lantern in this world. Only the selected seeds of large sects and forces would have an opportunity to fuse them."I wonder which ancient kings and sovereigns' bloodline my life lantern was condensed from."  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ Xu Qing took out a set of spare ordinary robes and wore them, and stared at the black umbrella shadow formed by the clouds. After a while, he inhaled slightly. Immediately, all the fiery fog within 30,000 feet instantly rolled over.It was as though Xu Qing had transformed into a vortex, causing the fiery fog to rush into his mouth and nose, leaving nothing behind.As the fog disappeared, Xu Qing's eyes grew brighter and brighter. It was as though there were stars in his eyes, emitting a soul-stirring light. His magic power was very intense, and was instinctively spilling out.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He knew that this was because he had just stepped into Foundation Building and his body hadn't completely adapted to this terrifying magic power."Foundation Building cultivators cultivate their magic apertures and life fire. After they form three balls of life fire, they can step into a new realm. My magic aperture can form four balls of life fire." Xu Qing sensed the black umbrella life lantern that was slowly calming down in his body. His eyes revealed deep anticipation.The captain's words about the life lantern had once said that even in the era before the god's fragmented face arrived, there weren't many descendants with the bloodline of the ancient kings and sovereigns who could form a life lantern. Moreover, most of them could only form one life lantern.Only the true heaven's chosen, the descendants who had the potential to become an ancient king or a sovereign, could form multiple life lanterns. The limit of life lanterns was the same as life fire."I'm already satisfied with one. I have to open 30 magic apertures as soon as possible!"Xu Qing sensed his current body. Under the cover of the black umbrella, the fluctuations of his cultivation weren't conspicuous. This was because the existence of the black umbrella was even more conspicuous than himself.Xu Qing glanced at the shadow. With a thought, a wisp of the shadow instantly fused into his body, enveloping the black umbrella life lantern.As soon as it got close, the shadow trembled violently in resistance. However, facing Xu Qing's calm gaze, it didn't dare to resist. It could only let Xu Qing manipulate it and turn it into a layer of cloth that covered the life lantern.Xu Qing's body instantly dimmed. Although the Foundation Building fluctuations were still there, the life lantern was no longer visible."It's a pity that the Mountains and Seas Art's level might be too low or it might have reached its true limit, so I'm unable to advance in it." Xu Qing felt some regret.The Mountains and Seas Art was of great help to him but he had cultivated it to the extreme. He was unable to make any progress and felt that he seemed to be lacking some opportunities."I have to think of a way to increase the level of the Mountains and Seas Art in the future.""After my cultivation base stabilizes, I'll return to the Seven Blood Eyes and exchange for a Foundation Building cultivation art when I go up the mountain to register my cultivation." Xu Qing didn't have a Foundation Building cultivation art now and was unable to open a new magic aperture. He took a deep breath and started to nourish his cultivation.Just like that, a month slowly passed.It had been almost three months since Xu Qing left the sect. The fluctuations in his body were also restrained now. In addition, with the shadow enveloping the life lantern, no matter how one looked at him, he was no different from an ordinary Foundation Building cultivator.During this month, Xu Qing's understanding and control over the life lantern in his body became even deeper.He slowly opened his eyes. As an obscure bolt of lightning flashed in his eyes, he calmly performed a series of hand seals, pointing at the sky.As the magic aperture in his body burned, a shocking force spread out from the second magic aperture and flowed into his finger through his meridians, forming a powerful energy that headed straight for the sky.The energy was forming a translucent object. It continuously expanded and finally transformed into the appearance of a plesiosaur. As soon as it appeared, it roared at the sky and its body quickly turned from translucent to corporeal.There was also a violent aura that continuously gathered and rose on its body. Finally, when it was fully corporeal and was no different from a true plesiosaur, a Foundation Building aura spread out from its body.The plesiosaur in the sky was reflected in Xu Qing's eyes. Its black body gave off a savage feeling, and its long neck was extremely agile. There was also a row of sharp spikes on its neck. Its two eyes were bright and full of life. In fact, if it was placed in the Forbidden Sea, unless one attacked it, it would be very difficult to tell that it was formed by a spell.Its turtle-like body clearly possessed powerful defense. When it opened its mouth, one could see vicious, sharp teeth. It had four wide flippers which would give it an astonishing speed in the sea.Looking at the plesiosaur that was over 3,000 feet long in the sky, Xu Qing took a step forward. He didn't use a flight talisman and directly stepped on the air.Step by step, he walked toward the plesiosaur like he was ascending a heavenly staircase.Xu Qing wasn't used to the first few steps, but after taking seven to eight steps, he found the feeling and easily neared the plesiosaur.The plesiosaur lowered its head, and Xu Qing stepped forward and stood on top of its head. With a low roar, the plesiosaur flapped its huge flippers and sped toward the horizon.It was extremely fast.This plesiosaur was invisible to the mortals' eyes. In fact, even Qi Condensation cultivators would need to gather spirit energy in their eyes to make out its details.At first glance, it looked like Xu Qing was moving in the sky with his hands behind his back!This was the Foundation Building.Back when Xu Qing was fleeing in the forbidden zone of the slums, the Diamond Sect's ancestor behind him was like this. He stood on the huge angry guardian warrior and moved forward.However, the guardian warrior shadow of the Diamond Sect's ancestor was much weaker than Xu Qing's in terms of materialization and aura.Although they were in the same realm, the difference between them was like heaven and earth.Standing on the plesiosaur's head, Xu Qing calmly looked at the ground and controlled the plesiosaur to fly toward the nearest city with a teleportation array.As he flew, he saw desolation all over the ground, the harsh environment, and skeletons.The mortals in this world were pitiful.Compared to mortals, cultivators seemed to have more choices, but they had to face the torture from anomalous substances and the risk of mutation. Moreover, the expensive cultivation resources were enough to make many cultivators despair.If one wanted to advance, they had to fight for it, and the fights would often be a life-and-death battle.As such, the cultivators of this world were helpless.It was also because of this that there were people like the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Perhaps he also had some glorious pasts, but in the end, after struggling bitterly to a certain extent, he chose a territory and lorded over others, enjoying the rest of his life in the chaotic world.There were pros and cons to such a choice.Xu Qing wanted to do the same. However, he was afraid that this kind of life wouldn't last for long before it was crushed by some unknown danger, so if he wanted to truly settle down and survive, he had to be stronger."I just want to survive safely in this chaotic world and live a little better." Xu Qing's gaze was reserved and the plesiosaur beneath him moved even faster.Gradually, as the wind blew, a city appeared in the distance.That wasn't the city Xu Qing had come from but another place with a teleportation array.Even though he was at the Foundation Building realm, Xu Qing's vigilance was still the same as when he was at the Qi Condensation Realm.As he arrived, he took a step forward. The plesiosaur dissipated and Xu Qing also silently landed on the ground.He tidied his clothes and changed his appearance, transforming into a sallow-faced middle-aged man who slowly walked toward the city ahead.This city didn't belong to the Seven Blood Eyes.Instead, just like the Red Plains, it was a teleportation point jointly built by the Seven Blood Eyes, Purple Earth, and the Litu Sect. Such a thing was common in the Nanhuang Continent.After all, the human race occupied a large territory in the Nanhuang Continent. There were many empty areas between the various forces.These places were either the intersection points of different forces or the resources there were extremely scarce. It was a pity to give up on them but there was no need to occupy them.However, for the sake of passage, the three parties jointly built and maintained it.Xu Qing's arrival immediately caused the guards in the city to be shocked. Even though Xu Qing had concealed his life lantern and didn't use the plesiosaur to enter, his Foundation Building cultivation was still discovered the moment he entered the city.Unless Foundation Building cultivators deliberately hid their aura fluctuations, even if they emitted a trace of aura, it was enough to make Qi Condensation cultivators' hearts skip a beat.Back then, when Xu Qing was still at the Qi Condensation Realm and didn't have the strength to fight against Foundation Building cultivators, it was the same. When he had encountered the Diamond Sect's ancestor for the first time, the other party glanced at him from afar and it caused his mind to rumble.As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he hadn't formed his life fire and couldn't enter the Mystic Brilliance Form. At that time, he was only in his normal state.The lower one's cultivation level was, the greater the feeling. One could only resist after reaching the eighth level of Qi Condensation. However, most of the time, this resistance was only against Foundation Building cultivators from small sects who had ordinary cultivation arts and had opened less than 30 magic apertures.If it was a large sect's Foundation Building cultivator, no matter how powerful the outstanding Qi Condensation cultivators were, they wouldn't be able to resist a Foundation Building cultivator who had formed a life fire and was in the Mystic Brilliance Form.They were on completely different levels.Just like back then outside the Pilotage Department, Deacon Li's arrival caused Xu Qing's mind to shake with just a low shout.Right now, his arrival was the same for the cultivators in the city.

Chapter 207 Bell Rings On The Mountain
In this chaotic world after the arrival of the god's fragmented face, most of the cultivators were Qi Condensation cultivators. There weren't many who could reach the Foundation Building realm, so it was rare to see them in the cities outside.Only a large sect like the Seven Blood Eyes would have a large number of Foundation Building cultivators.Xu Qing's appearance naturally caused some commotion. In fact, under the respectful gazes of those guards, before Xu Qing could reach the teleportation array, he sensed an energy fluctuation coming from the city lord's residence in the distance.Xu Qing frowned and coldly looked over.A stream of light flew over and stopped thirty feet away from Xu Qing, revealing a middle-aged man in luxurious robes.This middle-aged man had an ordinary appearance and his Foundation Building magic power was spread out as he sized up Xu Qing.Xu Qing also looked at his neck and judged how many magic apertures the other party had opened."Fellow Daoist, what are you here for? I'm Zhou Hengli, a member of the Zhou family of Purple Earth. I've been appointed as the city lord of this city. This city is jointly managed by Purple Earth, the Seven Blood Eyes, and the Litu Sect.""I'm only here to use the teleportation array," Xu Qing calmly said. He could faintly sense that the other party didn't have many magic apertures and hadn't reached the level of forming life fire.Zhou Hengli, who was in the air, showed nothing on his face but was extremely vigilant inwardly. He could sense a dense baleful aura from this sallow-faced cultivator in front of him.Clearly, the other party was someone who had killed a lot. Moreover, from his clothes, it was impossible to tell his origins. This made him extremely vigilant, and when the other party's gaze seemingly landed on his neck, his hair instinctively stood on their ends.What shocked him the most was that he couldn't see through the cultivation base of the person in front of him. He was worried that he had encountered someone with life fire…"Please!" Zhou Heng's heart trembled but his expression didn't reveal it at all. As he spoke in a low voice, he immediately made arrangements.Immediately, all the pedestrians in front of Xu Qing were dispersed and a path leading to the teleportation array was opened.Xu Qing was calm. He knew that the other party was not welcoming him. It was obvious that he wanted him to leave quickly. Also, he could sense strands of aura spreading out from the city.They weren't emitted by cultivators. It was more like some array formations were being activated.Xu Qing felt that this vigilance was normal. After all, to a city in the wilderness, if a foreign Foundation Building cultivator entered, they would naturally be highly vigilant.Xu Qing nodded and decided not to take his time. His speed erupted and he directly flew toward the teleportation array. His speed was so fast that it stirred up a violent wind in the surroundings.Zhou Hengli's eyes narrowed even more and he immediately followed.Xu Qing soon arrived at the teleportation location. This place had already been cleared and there was no one in the surroundings. Only a few guards who were maintaining the operation of the array formation greeted Xu Qing with reverence while shaking."Greetings, Senior. The array formation is ready. Where are you going?"Xu Qing looked at them and then glanced at the city lord who was following him from afar. This seemed normal but he knew the latter was actually extremely vigilant. He deeply sensed the status of a Foundation Building cultivator.He walked to the teleportation array and calmly spoke."Seven Blood Eyes' main city."As soon as he finished speaking, the guards who were maintaining the array formation in the surroundings hurriedly nodded and began to adjust the array formation for him. Only after confirming repeatedly that there were no problems did they respectfully retreat more than 100 feet.Xu Qing's gaze swept across the teleportation array. He didn't understand array formations but after teleporting many times, he understood some things. After sweeping his gaze across it, he stepped in. The teleportation array shone and his figure instantly disappeared.It was only when Xu Qing's figure disappeared from the teleportation array that Zhou Hengli, who was far away, heaved a long sigh of relief. Although he was at the Foundation Building realm, he didn't want to provoke such a murderous person."Under the rule that the Seven Blood Eyes doesn't welcome foreign Foundation Building cultivators, he still dares to go there, it means that there's a high chance that he's not a wanted criminal. Could he be a Foundation Building cultivator of the Seven Blood Eyes?"Zhou Hengli touched his neck and shook his head, no longer thinking about this matter. To him, all foreign Foundation Building cultivators were dangerous. If there was someone with life fire among them, he would probably die instantly. As such, sending them away as soon as possible was the best choice.Otherwise, if there was really a conflict, he would die for nothing in this wilderness city far away from his family. It would be very difficult for his family to find out anything.In the eastern part of the Nanhuang Continent, where the Truth Mountain Range was connected to the sea, under the gaze of the seven huge blood eyes, Xu Qing's figure suddenly appeared in the teleportation array in the center of the extremely prosperous main city.As soon as he appeared, he lifted his head before he could survey his surroundings. His expression changed slightly.He felt a powerful aura coming from all directions in the main city, enveloping him. Although he didn't make any movements, this aura lock was like a surveillance camera.Xu Qing wasn't unfamiliar with this aura. It was the power of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation.In the past, when Xu Qing returned, he had never felt this way.However, now that he had advanced to the Foundation Building realm and returned, he immediately understood the reason why foreign Foundation Building cultivators didn't dare to rashly come to the Seven Blood Eyes.Clearly, to this array formation, the priority of Foundation Building was greater than a disciple. Even though Xu Qing's identity token was shining at this moment, he couldn't resolve this feeling of surveillance because he hadn't gone up the mountain to register his cultivation.Xu Qing took a deep breath and retracted his gaze, calmly walking down the teleportation array.The invisible envelopment of the array formation didn't attract the attention of any cultivators or commoners. After Xu Qing left, he changed into the Daoist robe he had prepared.Back then, on the trip to Sea Lizard Island, Xu Qing had gained some experience. Hence, he prepared several sets of Daoist robes in his storage bag.Xu Qing wore the gray Daoist robe of a Seven Blood Eyes disciple and walked on the streets. He tried to restrain his cultivation base, observing if there would be any changes in the array formation.However, even though he had concealed his cultivation base to the extreme, causing the surrounding cultivators who passed by to not be able to sense him, the lock-on and surveillance of the array formation still existed. This allowed Xu Qing to have a deeper understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation."I wonder if I'll be able to avoid the array formation's lock by using the shadow to cover myself."Xu Qing pondered but didn't test it. In his opinion, there was no need for this for the time being. Moreover, there were risks regardless of whether this worked or not."Then, let's go up the mountain."Xu Qing mumbled. He looked at the Seventh Peak in the distance and walked toward it.On the way, he passed by many shops. Looking at the indifferent and hurried pedestrians on the streets and the gray-robed disciples who would occasionally appear, he couldn't help but recall the various things that had happened since he came to the Seven Blood Eyes.He sighed inwardly, but he was filled with anticipation that he would be able to obtain at least 5,000 spirit stones a month in the future.Just as his footsteps gradually quickened, a familiar figure appeared in the distance.The other party's appearance immediately aroused the reverence of the surrounding commoners. As they moved aside, the Seven Blood Eyes piedmont disciples in the crowd became even more respectful. It was difficult to hide the envy in their eyes.It was a youth wearing a light purple Daoist robe. When he walked through the crowd, that hint of purple represented the nobility of his status. Coupled with his extraordinary appearance and powerful cultivation aura, this person looked like a divine son who had descended to the mortal world in everyone's eyes.It was Zhao Zhongheng.Xu Qing saw him, and he also saw Xu Qing.If it was in the past, Zhao Zhongheng would probably have turned around and left immediately, unwilling to say another word to Xu Qing. However, after seeing Xu Qing today, he snorted and suddenly pointed at the sky.Immediately, a Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale appeared in the air. It roared at the sky before disappearing.This scene caused exclamations in the surroundings. Many piedmont disciples did not forget to shower praises.Zhao Zhongheng had a smug expression on his face as he looked at the expressionless Xu Qing and spoke proudly."I've also cultivated the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale!"Xu Qing's expression didn't change at all. He couldn't be bothered with the other party and continued walking toward the Seventh Peak.Zhao Zhongheng frowned. He felt uncomfortable when he didn't see Xu Qing's shocked expression. However, the scenes at sea back then had left a deep shadow in his mind. Hence, he endured it and didn't continue to show off as he walked toward the Seventh Peak.He had gone down the mountain this time because he had asked someone to forge an exquisite phoenix hairpin. Now, he was returning to the mountain to give it to Senior Sister Ding.There was only the entrance to the Seven Blood Eyes' Seven Peaks in the south of the city, so there were fewer and fewer pedestrians. As such, Zhao Zhongheng was surprised to see Xu Qing still continuing to walk forward.He sensed that the other party was moving toward the entrance to the mountain peak.Although he was curious, Zhao Zhongheng was proud and disdained to ask. However… as time passed, when Xu Qing was less than a thousand feet away from the steps of the Seventh Peak's mountain path, Zhao Zhongheng couldn't hold it in anymore.  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ "Xu Qing, where are you going?" Zhao Zhongheng quickened his pace and asked after nearing him."Up the mountain." Xu Qing frowned and calmly spoke."The mountain? Gray-robed disciples are not allowed to ascend the mountain unless they are summoned. Even if they are summoned, someone has to guide them! Only core disciples can ascend the mountain alone!" Zhao Zhongheng sized up Xu Qing a few times but didn't see any aura fluctuations from him. He also didn't see anyone waiting on the mountain path ahead, so he said coldly.Xu Qing didn't care about Zhao Zhongheng and continued forward, reaching the steps on the mountain path.Zhao Zhongheng sneered when he saw this scene."When a piedmont disciple steps onto the mountain path for no reason, they will be blasted out by the array formation. Xu Qing, I think you should…"Before Zhao Zhongheng could finish speaking, Xu Qing, who was in front of him, had his usual expression as he stepped onto the first step.The moment his right foot landed, the steps on the entire Seventh Peak's mountain path suddenly blurred. An invisible force instantly swept toward him, as though it was confirming something.Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the mountain peak in the distance. At this moment, the cultivation base in his body erupted and his Foundation Building aura surged out intensely. The bell on the Seventh Peak instantly rang out.Amidst the melodious and profound sounds, Xu Qing walked up the steps. As he walked forward step by step, Zhao Zhongheng, who was behind him, was hit by Xu Qing's Foundation Building aura and was forced back. His body trembled and his face was pale. His eyes looked like they were about to fall out as waves of emotions surged in his mind."Found-Found-Foundation Building!!"

Chapter 208 The Laws Of The Mountain
As Xu Qing's Foundation Building aura spread and the bell's chimes rang on the entire Seventh Peak, three figures soared into the air from the mountain peak and flew down the mountain.Generally speaking, if a foreign Foundation Building cultivator stepped onto the mountain steps here, they would only be stopped outside and wouldn't cause the bell to ring.They would need to report their identity and explain their purpose of coming. An array formation would inform the person they wanted to visit. After the other party agreed, they could ascend the mountain under the surveillance of the array formation.For instance, when the Diamond Sect's ancestor visited the Sixth Peak's Daoist Leisure Cloud, it was like this.There was only one possibility for the bell ringing when someone stepped onto the mountain steps.That was… the appearance of a new Foundation Building cultivator who wasn't registered in the array formation among the sect's disciples.Of course, the enemy's attacks were another matter.In the Seven Blood Eyes, not all piedmont disciples would choose to rent a spot in the sect's Foundation Building land when they attempted their breakthrough to the Foundation Building realm. On one hand, it was expensive. On the other hand, those who could stand out from countless Qi Condensation cultivators in this chaotic world must have their own fortuitous encounters.This wasn't a rare occurrence. After all, other than opportunities, there was almost no trust in sects based on interests.Therefore, about 30% of the Seven Blood Eyes' Foundation Building cultivators had made their breakthroughs outside.These opportunities were mostly related to some ruins. Although there were others paying attention to them too, since such a thing was not an exception, plundering was considered a taboo. Once there was malicious plundering, It would be fine if it couldn't be spread. However, once it was leaked out, it would shake the foundation of the Seven Blood Eyes.Therefore, it was strictly stopped by the Seven Blood Eyes. Although there would occasionally be conflicts in the dark, it was usually to a reasonable extent. After all, to the cultivators on the mountain of the Seven Blood Eyes, they would weigh whether it was worth it before they made a move.Very few people would be so stupid to take such risks for an unknown benefit.When Xu Qing chose to head out to break through to Foundation Building, he had already thought about these things. He looked at the three figures rapidly approaching and waited for them.Very soon, the whistling sound became clearer. Among the three figures heading here, the person at the front wore a purple robe. He had a medium build and a round face.It was the person who had guided Xu Qing the first time he went up the mountain. Back then, the other party had even kindly reminded him about the habitual flaw in his right hand and the matter of hiding a needle in cotton.Looking at the other party's figure, Xu Qing sighed with emotion. Back then, he had only heard the other party say to hide a needle in cotton. However, after his experience in the Seven Blood Eyes and meeting many people, he had deeply understood what the phrase meant.He had learned a lot from the Seven Blood Eyes.Xu Qing cupped his fists. The moment the other party got close, he bowed deeply.Laughter rang out from the sky.The round-faced cultivator's figure flashed and he arrived in front of Xu Qing. His expression was gentle and there was a smile on his face."Xu Qing, the first time I saw you back then, I felt that you're definitely not an ordinary person, so I reminded you. Now that we meet again, you're already someone of my level.""Thank you for your reminder back then, Senior." Xu Qing was grateful to this round-faced cultivator."There's no need to call me senior. You're already at the Foundation Building realm. You can just call me senior brother. Junior Brother Xu Qing, my name is Zhang Yunshi. You can call me Senior Brother Zhang."While the round-faced cultivator spoke, he saw the shocked Zhao Zhongheng not far away.He was a smart person to begin with. His gaze swept past Zhao Zhongheng's expression and then Xu Qing. He roughly guessed something but he wouldn't be meddlesome."Junior Brother Xu Qing, let's go up.""Yes, please." Xu Qing nodded politely and cupped his fists toward the other two Foundation Building cultivators beside him. His gaze then casually swept past them.He discovered that most of the Foundation Building cultivators on the mountain hid their aura. It was the same for these two people and Zhang Yunshi. As such, it was very difficult for Xu Qing to sense the exact depths of their cultivation bases immediately.This caused him to be extremely vigilant.These two people's statuses were clearly inferior to Zhang Yunshi's. Seeing that Zhang Yunshi had some connections with Xu Qing, they smiled faintly and cupped their fists in return before leaving.Just like that, Xu Qing walked up the steps with Zhang Yunshi.The trees on both sides of the mountain path provided shade. At that moment, the sea breeze caused the leaves to sway and spiritual birds chirped softly.The sound was very pleasant to the ears, as though it could sink into one's memories. The scene of the first time he went up the mountain surfaced and overlapped with this moment."Junior Brother Xu, I've already introduced the world at the foot of the mountain to you back then. Today, I'll tell you about the mountain." Zhang Yunshi's calm voice echoed on the path."There are 13 elders on the Seventh Peak and they are all Golden Core cultivators. Below them are more than 140 Foundation Building cultivators. After you register today, there will be 149 Foundation Building cultivators on the Seventh Peak.""It looks like a lot but in reality, it isn't many. There are only close to a thousand of them in the entire Seven Blood Eyes. You have to know that the Seven Blood Eyes is one of the four great forces in the Nanhuang Continent.""Therefore, the status and identity of a Foundation Building cultivator are extremely high.""This is the case everywhere in the Nanhuang Continent. It's even more so for my Seven Blood Eyes. After you register, you'll obtain about 5,700 spirit stones every month.""The exact amount depends on the monthly earnings of the Seven Blood Eyes, so it's not fixed. However, the difference isn't very big.""In addition, you will obtain the right to stay on the mountain. However, you have to spend money for the cave abode and the sect's Foundation Building cultivation arts. It won't be free like when you were at Qi Condensation. As for the cultivation arts, you have the right to purchase any Foundation Building cultivation arts inside the Scripture Hall.""At the same time, as a Foundation Building cultivator, you have four rights.""The first right is that from now on, you have the right to open a new port. You can open a port that belongs to you in the harbor area!""Whether you do business outside or inside, the sect will collect half of the profits from all the business in the port, but this will require people to operate or manage the businesses. The initial investment will be huge and you will have to bear it yourself.""If you don't want the right to establish a port, you can obtain the ownership of a street in the main city. All the shops on that street will have to pay you rent. This method is simple and direct.""Both of these choices are based on preferences. You can choose for yourself.""The second right is that if a piedmont disciple of your peak provokes you, you can kill him. However, if you kill one person, you have to pay 100,000 spirit stones as a punishment. If you kill another person, the price will be doubled and so on. It will never be reset."The round-faced cultivator smiled and spoke, but his words caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow."This rule is actually a line in the minds of my Seven Blood Eyes' Foundation Building cultivators. Regardless of whether it's in the sect or outside the sect, they will weigh the worth in killing weaklings.""If it's a piedmont disciple of other mountains, the price will double on top of this.""As for the third right, you can choose two piedmont disciples or other people you acknowledge to become your followers. They will obtain the qualifications to stay in the main city for free. They can also follow you up the mountain and register in your name to cultivate.""You won't have to pay teleportation fees in any branch of the Seven Blood Eyes. You will also have 100 residency spots in the branch city every year. You have to know that the residency rights of the branch city are very precious in the scavenger campsites and small cities outside. You can't have them unless you are recommended by the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples.""The last right is the protection of the Seven Blood Eyes which prevents the Golden Cores outside to not dare to come here to kill you. Of course, if you take out enough spirit stones, even Nascent Soul cultivators won't dare to kill you. In fact, if you have more spirit stones, you can put up a bounty. There will definitely be someone in the sect who is willing to help you kill them.""You have to remember that the disciples at the foot of the mountain are a group of wolf cubs, while the people on the mountain are lone wolves with their own thoughts!""Also, you don't have to worry about the sect's Golden Core attacking you. If they attack you outside, you're just unlucky. However, in the sect, no matter what the reason is, you have to pay a fine of a million spirit stones if you kill a Foundation Building cultivator. It's the same for killing between Foundation Building cultivators. It will double in the future and it will never be reset.""So, it's back to the old logic. Is it worth it?!" There was a smile in the round-faced cultivator's voice, but his words revealed the status of a Foundation Building cultivator and the cruelty on the mountain."What about obligations?" Xu Qing asked."Obligations?" The round-faced cultivator smiled."Everyone relied on their own efforts to struggle and kill their way out of the foot of the mountain. Therefore, they don't have any obligations to the sect. If they're willing to stay, they can get money. If they want to leave, the sect won't hold them. However, the missions issued by the sect are rich in rewards, so everyone is fighting to complete them.""This is a pretty good way to gain spirit stones for a long period. When we encounter an invasion from foreign enemies that wants to destroy our long-term benefits, we will naturally act accordingly. After all, if we just act a bit carefully in the Foundation Building realm, we can live for a long time. How good is it to get money every month?""Of course, if the enemy gives an even greater benefit, it's not unacceptable. However, think about it. Are the invading enemies stupid? It's useless to bribe one or two disciples. If they want to bribe more, they have to take out huge benefits. The gains from attacking the Seven Blood Eyes will be far less than what they spent, so is it worth it?""As for starting a war with other forces, it's actually a magnified version of the competition you took part in. If there are benefits, we will naturally swarm over.""The elders on the mountain also know that we are all wolf cubs, so they don't manage us at all. They only lure us with benefits.""What truly reassures the higher-ups are the core disciples who enjoy the preferential treatment of the sect the moment they enter. The nurturing of these people is based on cohesion and a sense of belonging."With Zhang Yunshi's introduction, Xu Qing had a deeper understanding of the Seven Blood Eyes. While he was pondering, they arrived halfway up the mountain."You came at the wrong time. New Foundation Building cultivators are qualified to pay a visit to the Peak Lord once. However, the peak lords of the seven peaks have gone out to sea. Something major is probably going to happen.""First Elder and Second Elder aren't here either. Only Third Elder is guarding the mountain. After you pay him a visit, I'll bring you to the cave abode registration area and the Scripture Hall."Soon after, Xu Qing saw the Third Elder's hall in the distance. Outside the hall, he saw another familiar figure. It was Deacon Li.  Best novel online free at 𝙣O𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙗𝙞𝙣 He was sitting cross-legged in front of the hall. At this moment, he opened his eyes and looked at Xu Qing and Zhang Yunshi with a faint smile."When the bell rang just now, I had guessed that the new Foundation Building cultivator might be you."Xu Qing cupped his fists slightly and glanced at Deacon Li. Although the other party had also hidden his cultivation fluctuations, Xu Qing compared with his senses from back then in his memory. At that moment, he vaguely felt that Deacon Li should be a very strong Foundation Building realm cultivator.'He should be a Foundation Building cultivator who has formed his life fire.' Xu Qing mumbled inwardly without batting an eyelid."Go in. The elder is waiting for you." Deacon Li's gaze moved away from Xu Qing and landed on Zhang Yunshi. Zhang Yunshi shrugged and stayed put.Xu Qing took a deep breath and walked forward until he entered the main hall he had visited before.The moment he stepped in, the feeling from back then descended once again. The pressure from the person sitting and meditating in the main hall spread in all directions like an avalanche.However, this time around, Xu Qing saw the other party's appearance clearly.It was an old man with age spots on his face. He wore a purple Daoist robe inlaid with golden threads and looked at Xu Qing expressionlessly.The instant their gazes met, Xu Qing's mind shook. The other party's gaze was like lightning, instantly penetrating his body and seeing it clearly.However, the life lantern that Xu Qing's shadow covered wasn't something the other party could sense."Greetings, Third Elder." Xu Qing lowered his head and bowed respectfully."To be able to open two magic apertures at such a young age, not bad." After Third Elder calmly spoke, he said something that caused Xu Qing's heart to tremble."Did you take the merfolk race's Spirit Breath Lantern?"

Chapter 209 Purple Robe
These words were like thunder that echoed in Xu Qing's ears, causing his mind and heart to fluctuate slightly. However, Xu Qing's expression didn't change much, nor did he think too much about it. He lowered his head and respectfully spoke."Yes."There was no need to hide this matter. Although the merfolk race's Spirit Breath Lantern was very valuable, it wasn't like no one had obtained it before. Xu Qing's actions back then seemed to be secretive but in reality, if someone really wanted to investigate, they could still find many clues.Xu Qing felt that there was no need to lie about this as it would give off the feeling that he was trying to hide something."How do you plan to deal with it?" Third Elder looked at Xu Qing and calmly asked."Sell it."Xu Qing spoke without hesitation and lifted his head to look at Third Elder.At that moment, the aura emitted by Third Elder, who was sitting upright, distorted the surroundings, causing the entire hall to be filled with oppression. As his words echoed, the oppression became even more intense.In fact, that piercing feeling appeared once again. However, Xu Qing felt that it was still much better than last time.The previous time, it was difficult for him to even lift his head. Just looking at the elder caused his eyes to feel intense pain.When Third Elder heard this, a smile appeared on his face. He seemed satisfied that Xu Qing was frank and straightforward."Xu Qing, I have to say that I think very highly of you. Since you obtained the Spirit Breath Lantern yourself, I won't ask for it. I don't fancy that lantern.""However, let me remind you that if you want to sell it, do it as soon as possible. Otherwise, there will be people who will covet it. This old man can know that you obtained it. It won't be difficult for others to know as well.""Now, give me your identity token."Xu Qing's gaze was reserved as he took out his identity token.Third Elder waved his right hand and the token flew into his hand. He patted it lightly and the token immediately trembled and emitted a light. After the information inside was quickly adjusted, an array formation's energy arrived, as though it was imprinting.A moment later, the light from the token dissipated and returned to normal. Third Elder waved his hand and the token headed straight for Xu Qing.Xu Qing raised his hand and took it. He was prepared to withstand a great force. After all, he had experienced something similar when he met the director of the Homicide Department back then.However, as he caught the token, there was actually no force emitted. It was as though all the force had perfectly dissipated the moment he touched it.This scene caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow. He could sense the difference between the two sides.It was easy to release it, but it was difficult to perfectly control it to the point that the token had no force left in it."You can leave now." Third Elder closed his eyes.Xu Qing cupped his fists respectfully and left. Just as he was about to walk out of the hall, Third Elder's voice rang out again."Zhongheng's nature isn't bad.""Disciple understands." Xu Qing turned and bowed before walking out of the hall. He was aware that the other party didn't say this when he arrived that day. Instead, Deacon Li spoke because his status wasn't high enough.However, it was different now.As Xu Qing walked out, Deacon Li nodded at him and closed his eyes in silence. Xu Qing looked at Zhang Yunshi in the distance as he walked over.Zhang Yunshi smiled and brought Xu Qing to get the Daoist robe. At the same time, Xu Qing also chose a cave abode. However, most of the good cave abodes had been chosen. The place he chose was a little remote.However, Xu Qing felt that it wasn't bad. As for the price, it wasn't as expensive as he imagined.Finally, under Zhang Yunshi's introduction and guidance, Xu Qing went to the Scripture Hall and exchanged for Foundation Building cultivation arts. Other than that, he also purchased some body-refining arts.After doing all this, it was already dusk. Zhang Yunshi led Xu Qing to the cave abode he had chosen before he cupped his fists and left. Before he left, he smiled and spoke."Junior Brother Xu, the reason why I accompanied you so long today is partly because I feel that I have some fate with you and partly because I accepted the mission for receiving disciples ascending the mountain this month. I will obtain the sect's reward because of this.""So, you don't have to worry about why I'm being so hospitable. However, in the end, you and I can be considered to have affinity. If we meet on the sea in the future, I hope we can take care of each other.""Lastly, Junior Brother Xu Qing, let me remind you out of friendship. Once us cultivators step into Foundation Building, we have to open 30 magic apertures as quickly as possible. From there, we can form a life fire and possess the Mystic Brilliance Form.""You have to know that cultivators with the Mystic Brilliance Form and without are two completely different concepts. We've put so much effort into advancing to the Foundation Building realm. If we don't form our life fire as soon as possible, we'll be at a disadvantage. Many Foundation Building cultivators who died are those who have not formed a life fire.""A Foundation Building cultivator who doesn't have the Mystic Brilliance Form can only bully Qi Condensation cultivators," Zhang Yunshi said. After he finished speaking, he glanced at Xu Qing's right hand and discovered that he couldn't detect any habitual flaws. He smiled and left.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. Regardless of his understanding or the other party's explanation at this moment, it made him understand the importance of life fire to Foundation Building cultivators.He cupped his fists and bowed slightly, watching as Zhang Yunshi's figure disappeared.At the same time, he retracted the vigilance against the other party and turned to look at his cave abode.The place he chose was against a cliff. The greenish-black stone door of the cave abode was closed and there were weeds everywhere. The door was also covered in moss and humidity permeated the air.After checking this place, Xu Qing walked closer to the stone door and took out the jade slip that controlled the cave abode. Immediately, the stone door of the cave abode shone with runes. Xu Qing followed the method recorded in the jade slip and placed his hand on the runes.It was like imprinting a mark. As the runes shone, the cave abode collected his imprint. The gate slowly opened, revealing the space inside.This cave abode wasn't big and only had two rooms. There was a pearl on the ceiling of the above that emitted a gentle glow. Only it hadn't been used for a long time and was covered in dust.Xu Qing waved his hand and wind appeared to clean up the place. After that, he carefully checked to ensure that there was nothing wrong before walking out again and arranging poison powder outside the cave abode.This time, he put a lot of poison traps. After he finished dealing with the outside and returned to the cave abode, he continued to sprinkle a lot. Finally, he took out the protective array formations he had bought and activated them.As the cave abode's door closed and the cave abode's array formation was activated, Xu Qing finally heaved a long sigh of relief.He recalled what he had seen and heard today, and vaguely got the feeling of when he had joined the Seven Blood Eyes for the first time. However, at that time, he was at the Qi Condensation Realm, and now, he was already at the Foundation Building Realm."I've finally reached the Foundation Building realm…" Xu Qing mumbled. After recalling the various rights of the Foundation Building cultivators in the Seven Blood Eyes, he changed into the purple Daoist robe. He looked at the robe, and a hint of brilliance appeared in Xu Qing's eyes.There was an array formation on this Daoist robe that provided a certain level of protection. If it was placed outside or at the foot of the mountain, many disciples would fight over it if the color was changed.Xu Qing touched the robe and sat down before taking out a jade slip.This jade slip was one of the Seventh Peak's Foundation Building cultivation arts he had exchanged from the Scripture Hall.Xu Qing infused his spirit energy into the jade slip to read it.After reaching the Foundation Building realm, he understood that he had to cultivate the Foundation Building cultivation art as soon as possible. Only then could he continue to progress like before.As he read, time slowly flowed by. Very soon, the moonlight spread outside and drifted onto the stone door of Xu Qing's cave abode. From afar, it looked like the bright moon was scattering its <anno data-annotation-id="3e19c78a-39d7-4fd5-b566-21fe9f29aea3">light</anno>.The stone door emitted a hint of antiquity in the moonlight.In the cave abode, a sharp glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes as he finished reading the jade slip."Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art…"The Foundation Building cultivation art of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes was this Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art. The name itself revealed a deep killing intent. One could imagine that this cultivation art was definitely inclined toward evil. However, this was also in line with Xu Qing's judgment. After all, the sect's name was the Seven Blood Eyes.Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art had no levels. Its main focus was on opening the magic apertures as fast as possible. It first cultivated a flame called fiendish fire in the magic aperture.This flame was a strange fire that could fuse with the aura of the Forbidden Sea. Moreover, the more it was cultivated, the more intense the fiendish fire became.This fiendish fire could be used as an attack method, and there was also the core of this art… Soul Devour!The enemy's soul was extracted and used as fuel to create a powerful impact force in the body to open the magic apertures. This method was extremely cruel and direct.According to the cultivation art's description, the soul of a Foundation Building cultivator who hadn't formed a life fire was enough for a disciple who cultivated the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art to open a magic aperture. If the souls were of the Qi Condensation cultivators, there would need to be a hundred or more of them to barely achieve a similar effect. Moreover, the further the cultivator progressed in this art, the greater the demand."Regardless of whether it's sea beasts or nonhuman races, they can all be used as fuel for the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art. Among them, the nonhuman races have the best effect. Especially the Sea Corpse Race, because their formation is related to souls, their effects are extremely astonishing…" The sentence on the cultivation art jade slip revealed a strong sense of bloodlust.This cultivation art was simple and direct. There was nothing fancy about it but it was extremely violent.When this Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art was cultivated to the end, the fiendish fire would reach its ultimate state where it was stored in every magic aperture in the body. At that time, the cultivator would no longer need souls to break open the magic apertures. Instead, they could suppress the enemies' souls in their magic apertures.Burning the souls to strengthen their magic power.It could be said that any disciple who cultivated the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art was a killing god.However… not all disciples cultivated this technique. There were three types of Foundation Building cultivation arts on the Seventh Peak, and one was called the Sea King's Book. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This cultivation art was relatively gentle. It mainly absorbed sea beasts and used a special method to nurture them in the magic apertures. It was divided into ten levels. Every time one cultivated, they could instantly open seven to eight magic apertures.The main focus of this art was to constantly capture sea beasts and refine them.The sea beasts in their magic apertures would strengthen their magic power.The first cultivation art, Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, was savage and its cultivation speed was very fast. However, it demanded a lot of killing and if one was careless, they would die.As for the second type, Sea King's Book, it was mainly refining sea beasts. As their magic power became denser, their ability to protect themselves would increase. However, their combat strength was much weaker in comparison.As for the third type, it was called Life Art.This technique was even gentler. It didn't require external forces to break through and only required one to constantly cultivate. Hence, most of the time, the disciples who cultivated this art would be in closed-door cultivation. Their cultivation speed was incomparably slow but the benefits were also great. They would rarely be killed outside.This was because they almost didn't go out. When they attacked, they would usually cooperate with others or play the role of support.Everyone's choices were different based on their personalities.After Xu Qing pondered over this, he couldn't tell which was better. However, he immediately rejected the mediocre Sea King's Book. As for the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art and the Life Art, these two were opposite extremes.While Xu Qing was considering his cultivation art, on the Endless Sea outside the Seven Blood Eyes, the great wing in the sky roared. Old Master Seventh, who was standing in the pavilion on the great wing's body, was looking in the direction of the Seven Blood Eyes.The great wing under him was like a divine creature. Wherever it passed, the sea would rumble and surge."Old Master Seventh, the kid has reached the Foundation Building realm." Beside Old Master Seventh stood the middle-aged servant who had given Xu Qing the token back then. At this moment, he took out a jade slip and looked at it before reporting to Old Master Seventh in a low voice."Should I go back and arrange a summons?" The servant looked at Old Master Seventh.Old Master Seventh shook his head."There's no need.""The war is about to begin. We'll talk about this after the battle. Among the 100 tokens issued, although he was the first to walk out, there will definitely be others in the future. We need to compare them.""Also, the current him… is still far from becoming the fourth.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="3e19c78a-39d7-4fd5-b566-21fe9f29aea3">It sounds repetitive, but this phrase is a part of a Mid-Autumn Festival poem.</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 210 Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art
"Life Art is too passive!" In the cave abode, Xu Qing lifted his head, his eyes revealing determination.He had a life lantern, so it would be a good choice for him to choose the Life Art. He could just hide in his cave abode until he slowly cultivated his life fire. His combat strength would still be astonishing.However, this would take a very long time and cultivation required a large number of spirit stones. His magic boat also had to be upgraded. Most importantly, Xu Qing felt that in this world, even the sunrise and sunset might change one day.As such, it wasn't suitable for him to quietly cultivate the Life Art.He was worried that if he cultivated this, an accident would happen before his life fire was formed.Xu Qing didn't like this passiveness. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  He decided to cultivate the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art.When the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art was cultivated to the extreme, after suppressing the enemy's souls in one's magic apertures, not only could it increase the density of magic power, but the cultivation art jade slip also said that it could fuse these suppressed souls with the magic ship using a special method.After fusion, the souls would be like the spirit of the magic ship.This would allow the magic ship to possess some characteristics of a magic treasure!As for magic treasures, Xu Qing had never seen them before.However, he knew that magic treasures were extremely rare and couldn't be used sustainably. Each of them had earth-shattering power."To a certain extent, my life lantern might also be a special magic treasure?" Xu Qing mumbled. He wasn't clear about this.He no longer thought about it. After making a decision, he immediately took the jade slip and sat after studying it for a moment. The magic apertures in his body shone and burned his spirit sea as he began to cultivate according to the description of the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art!The first step of the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art was to form the fiendish fire.The magic apertures of Foundation Building cultivators all contained magic fire. This fire could burn the spirit sea and form magic power. At the same time, it was also the key to the final ignition of life fire.Because Xu Qing had fused with the black umbrella life lantern, the flames in his magic aperture were black due to the life lantern's aura.As for the fire cultivated by the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, its color was also black.It looked similar to Xu Qing's black umbrella fire but four hours later, when Xu Qing cultivated this scripture and formed a trace of fiendish fire in his magic aperture, he discovered that there was a huge difference between the two types of fire in his magic aperture.Regardless of whether it was in terms of heat or level, the black umbrella's flames were much stronger than the fiendish fire. Its aura was stronger as well. The only difference was that it didn't have the ability to absorb soul power.However, this matter was very easy to resolve. After Xu Qing fused the fiendish fire with his black fire, the fiendish fire he cultivated was instantly devoured. At the same time, the soul-absorbing ability of the fiendish fire slowly appeared in his black fire.Xu Qing was satisfied and continued cultivating.Three days passed.When Xu Qing filled the black fire in his two magic apertures with dense soul-absorbing powers, he ended his cultivation. He knew that the most important thing to him now was soul.He needed souls to be used as firewood to open his third magic aperture."I wonder if Senior Brother Zhang San has returned. When he refines my magic boat, I'll go out to sea."Xu Qing looked at his shadow. After some thought, he took out the black iron stick and opened the seal on the Diamond Sect's ancestor.In an instant, the aura of the Diamond Sect's ancestor spread out. However, he was clearly afraid and didn't dare to say a word. It was as though he was afraid that he would say something wrong and cause Xu Qing to kill him.Xu Qing glanced at the black iron stick and didn't bother with it. Instead, the suppression power of the purple crystal in his body suddenly appeared and suppressed the shadow in front of the Diamond Sect's ancestor who was hiding in the iron stick.This was a daily occurrence. From the start to the end, Xu Qing's expression was calm. As for the shadow, it seemed to be used to it and didn't resist or reject him at all. It allowed Xu Qing to suppress it until it was about to shatter.However, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was trembling even more intensely. He was like a bird startled by the twang of a bow. His artifact spirit's body even turned unstable."The current you is no longer of much use to me," Xu Qing calmly said. After his cultivation reached the Foundation Building realm, Xu Qing had another opinion of his shadow. Although the other party had its own will, Xu Qing could suppress it. What he needed was for the other party to be stronger.Otherwise, it would be a little difficult for it to keep up with him and become his trump card. As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick, Xu Qing felt that it was the same.The other party was being too comfortable. If that was the case, it wouldn't be in line with his future path.His words instantly caused the shadow to tremble, and the black iron stick shook even more intensely.A long time later, under Xu Qing's cold gaze, the shadow started distorting. As it twisted and turned, a faint wisp of consciousness entered Xu Qing's mind."Anomalous substances… advancement… divinity…"Xu Qing fell into deep thought. His gaze moved away from the shadow and landed on the black iron stick. There was no killing intent in his eyes but this gaze caused the iron stick to almost crack from all the trembling."What's the use of having you?"Xu Qing slowly spoke. When he lifted his right hand, the wisp of the Diamond Sect's ancestor's life soul appeared in his hand, as though he wanted to crush it. The Diamond Sect's ancestor quickly came out of the iron stick."Master, Master, don't kill me. I can cultivate. I have an artifact spirit cultivation art but I was either weak or in a deep sleep during this period. I didn't have time to cultivate.""Master, give me a chance. I'll definitely work hard in my cultivation, definitely!!"The Diamond Sect's ancestor wailed. The fear in his heart was indescribable."The two of you, I'll evaluate you in half a year. The weak will be eliminated!" Xu Qing calmly said. As soon as he spoke, a sense of ferocity instantly rose in the shadow. However, it wasn't targeted at Xu Qing but at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor was furious, but he didn't reveal it on the surface. On the contrary, his gentle expression caused the shadow to be confused and the ferocity gradually dissipated a little.Xu Qing understood the Diamond Sect's ancestor and didn't bother with the scheming between the two. He kept the black iron stick and opened the cave abode's door.It was noon. The sun shone through the blue sky and white clouds. There was also the humid sea breeze that blew in, faintly bringing about the clamor of the world at the foot of the mountain.However, as the distance was too far, the clamor it brought carried the ethereal feeling of being separated from the world.Xu Qing walked out of the cave abode and stood beside the cliff, looking at the main city below. The ports he saw were very prosperous and there was an endless stream of boats coming and going.It was the same in other areas. One could see a tide of pedestrians on the streets. The prosperity of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city was reflected in their eyes.Although Xu Qing had climbed up the mountain and looked down the mountain twice before, he wasn't a cultivator of the mountain at that time. The feeling was completely different from now."It's different and also the same."Xu Qing muttered after a long while.What was different was the level. What was the same was that everyone was still living under the cover of the god's fragmented face.Xu Qing looked at the port area again.As a Foundation Building cultivator, he had the right to establish a new port. However, he hadn't thought about whether he should use it or not. He pondered and stepped into the air.He was going to make a trip to the shops in the port area to buy some powerful jade talismans that could be used by Foundation Building cultivators. After all, with his current cultivation, ordinary talismans were no longer enough to deal with his needs.Most Foundation Building cultivators relied on jade talismans.Also, Xu Qing planned to look for his informant.After he became a Foundation Building cultivator, he had two spots for followers. He was ready to give one to the informant, but he didn't intend to bring her up the mountain.He also wanted to check if Zhang San had returned.Furthermore, his identity in the Homicide Department had changed when he reached the Foundation Building realm. He still held a post inside, but his position in the identity jade slip had changed.He was no longer the vice-captain of Team Six but one of the deputy directors of the Homicide Department, in charge of the Black Division.As the deputy director, under normal circumstances, he didn't need to go to the Homicide Department. He could just help out when necessary. Moreover, his salary was also increased to 100 spirit stones every month.Of course, Foundation Building cultivators could give up on this position.These spirit stones weren't much in comparison to the sect's share of the profits but Xu Qing felt that he couldn't reject it. After all, when he first came to the Seven Blood Eyes, 100 spirit stones was already a huge sum.As Xu Qing descended the mountain and appeared in the port area, numerous respectful gazes instantly gathered on him. Not only did all the pedestrians on the streets retreat, but the shopkeepers of the various peaks also quickly walked out and bowed respectfully.This was especially so for those piedmont disciples. No matter which peak they were from, they were respectful, and all of them bowed to greet him from afar.To the people at the foot of the mountain, Foundation Building… was no different from a god.To them, both the god and Foundation Building cultivators could kill them.The latter could even kill faster.Under the sunlight, Xu Qing's dark purple Daoist robe seemed to represent supreme dignity.Xu Qing, who was used to concealing himself, wasn't used to the feeling of being the center of attention, so he immediately disappeared from the place.When he appeared, he was already at the usual place he met with his informant.Under his summoning, not long later, his informant arrived rapidly. Looking at Xu Qing's dark purple Daoist robe, the informant stopped in her tracks and was at a loss. Her eyes revealed extreme reverence and her breathing became rough.The shock on her face was indescribable. It was only when Xu Qing coldly glanced at her that the informant's body trembled and she immediately knelt down."Master."Xu Qing took out a jade slip and waved it slightly. This jade slip transformed into a beam of light that headed straight for the informant. It slowly stopped in front of her and landed in her trembling hand."This is a follower token. You should know its value. There's no need to go up the mountain.""Go and plan all the preparations needed to open a new port in three months. This is your next mission."When Xu Qing's voice rang out, he had already left. The sea breeze blew past, blowing the informant's long hair, revealing her beautiful face. She lifted her head and stared blankly at the departing Xu Qing. Her breathing became increasingly hurried and her expression was filled with disbelief.She had never imagined that the other party… would actually leap to the high and mighty Foundation Building realm in such a short period.
