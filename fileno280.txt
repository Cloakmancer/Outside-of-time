The so-called emperor-level cultivation arts were secret arts created by those ancient kings and sovereigns, and were not handed down to posterity. Among them, some were a complete cultivation technique set, while some were secret techniques.However, no matter which, their might was extremely astonishing.Their mysteries and strengths were inconceivable and were naturally incomparably precious.In addition, emperor-level cultivators were rare, so they became one of the foundational resources of all forces.However, most of them were basically unable to be cultivated because of the harsh requirements. For example, many of them needed to be combined with the bloodline power of the inheritance. This made almost everyone unable to fulfill the requirement.Moreover, it was very difficult for other races to cultivate the emperor-level cultivation arts of other species, making it even harder to find a successor. There were only a few that didn't require bloodlines and could be cultivated by any species. The value of such an emperor-level cultivation art was the greatest. Any one of them could make people go crazy and helpless.Madness was due to envy, but helplessness was due to inalienability.Once an emperor-level cultivation art formed a seed, even if outsiders killed the possessor, they would get nothing.Even if the possessor described the content of the cultivation art, outsiders would forget it immediately.Even if they used a special way to preserve the memories, as long as they didn't have the inheritance seed in their body, they still couldn't cultivate it.The inheritance seed was like a certificate. Only those with it were qualified to cultivate.Golden Crow Refines All Life was like this.To be precise, Golden Crow Refines All Life wasn't a cultivation technique but a secret art!This secret art was astonishingly powerful. According to the information Xu Qing had obtained, after cultivating this secret art to the large success stage, it could allow the cultivator to achieve the Golden Crow Emperor Body.Once the Golden Crow Emperor Body was formed, the cultivator's physical combat strength would step into the emperor realm. They could even transform into a Golden Crow and command the nine heavens.These descriptions and understandings made Xu Qing realize that this Golden Crow Refines All Life was a body-refining secret art.The cultivation process emphasized natural selection. By refining the origin blood of myriad races and fusing them into their body, they would constantly improve their body, causing it to become stronger and stronger like nurturing a magic treasure until it finally transformed into the Golden Crow Emperor Body.After all, this was a method created by the Golden Crow. Clearly, in the Golden Crow's understanding, there wasn't much concept of good and evil. To it, the strong preyed on the weak and continuously evolved to become the strongest.As the cultivator continued to absorb the origin blood of myriad races to strengthen themself, they could also snatch the target's racial talent!This point was extremely domineering.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ  However, there were restrictions. If the cultivator wanted to snatch the racial talents, it wasn't enough to simply refine one member of the race. They had to refine many members of this race, and it was better if the targets had cultivation bases. Only by accumulating like this would they be able to completely plunder the racial talent of that race.At that moment, Xu Qing leaned against the ship's wall and closed his eyes. The information he had obtained this time quickly surfaced in his mind. The more he sensed, the faster his heart raced.A long time later, Xu Qing opened his eyes, revealing a hint of shock."Emperor-level body refinement secret art!"Xu Qing wasn't unfamiliar with body refinement.The first cultivation art he came into contact with was the Mountains and Seas Art. This gave him a high lethality when he was in the scavenger campsite. Even when he arrived in the Seven Blood Eyes and saw the terror of spells, he still didn't give up on body refinement.This lasted until his Mountains and Seas Art reached its limit after reaching the ninth level.Even though the Ba shadow behind him was covered in lava and had an astonishing aura, and two molts that looked like they were about to grow horns appeared on its head, in the end, it still didn't complete the transformation and reach the tenth level.This had nothing to do with Xu Qing. In reality, because there were no anomalous substances in his body and coupled with the purple crystal, he had already cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art to an unprecedented level.What made him unable to break through in the end was the level of the Mountains and Seas Art.After all, this was only a low-level cultivation art that was circulated in the public.The limitations of this technique caused Xu Qing to have no choice but to stop and use the Sea Transformation Art to break through to Foundation Building.However, his pursuit of body refinement didn't decrease. After he stepped into the Foundation Building realm, he had also exchanged for some body refinement techniques in the sect, but their effects weren't good and they were unable to push the Mountains and Seas Art to the next level.Now, Xu Qing's eyes gleamed.He sensed some of the information of Golden Crow Refines All Life and the Golden Crow's inheritance seed beside the life lantern. He was eager to give it a try."I wonder if my Mountains and Seas Art will be beneficial to cultivating Golden Crow Refines All Life."Xu Qing muttered inwardly. He felt that since they were both body refinement techniques, there was a high chance that his achievements in the Mountains and Seas Art would be of some assistance in cultivating Golden Crow Refines All Life.Right now, however, his injuries were too serious and it wasn't suitable for him to cultivate immediately. Hence, Xu Qing took a deep breath and endured the intense pain in his body as he began to regulate his breathing. As his magic power circulated, it fused into the purple crystal and he used all his strength to recover from his injuries.Just like that, time slowly passed.In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.During these ten days, regardless of day or night, the shadow emitted extremely loyal emotions. During the day, it blocked the sunlight for Xu Qing and at night, it protected Xu Qing under the sea.When the Diamond Sect's ancestor saw all of this, he sneered inwardly and thought to himself, 'The more you perform at this moment, the more ruthlessly Demon Xu will suppress you. After all, the feeling you give off now is that you won't become honest unless you are taught a lesson.'The correct thing to do now wasn't to express its loyalty so fiercely but to subtly influence Xu Qing. At the thought of this, the Diamond Sect's ancestor controlled the black iron stick to head straight for the sky and sweep through the surroundings before returning. It quietly floated in a location where it could observe all the areas around Xu Qing.In these ten days, although Xu Qing encountered some dangers from sea beasts, regardless of whether it was the Diamond Sect's ancestor or the shadow, they were completely different from before. Under their attacks, Xu Qing could rest in peace.As for those sea beasts, Xu Qing didn't kill them. Instead, he used the shadow as a rope and tied them up before placing them under the sea. He then dragged them like he was rearing them.With the constant recovery effect of the purple crystal, Xu Qing was much better now other than looking a little pale.After his magic power circulated in the newly-grown flesh and bones, it wasn't much different from before he was injured. At this moment, Xu Qing felt that it was time for him to cultivate Golden Crow Refines All Life.He sat cross-legged and took a deep breath. The moment the sun rose into the sky, Xu Qing lifted his head and began to ponder about Golden Crow Refines All Life that had been completely imprinted in his mind for ten days."The nine heavens forge the Emperor's body, the Golden Crow refines all life. The talents of all races belong to me. My life illuminates the sky!"Xu Qing muttered. He performed a series of hand seals with both hands and placed them in front of his dantian. His two thumbs interlocked and the four fingers of each hand spread out in a fan shape.After that, he took a deep breath toward the rising sun in the sky.In an instant, the sky seemed to blur and distort in Xu Qing's eyes. A heat that couldn't be seen but could be sensed by Xu Qing seemed to emit from the sun in the sky and enter his body through his mouth.The Golden Crow beside Xu Qing's life lantern suddenly awakened. Its wings suddenly flapped as though they wanted to spread out. It lifted its head and swallowed the burning power of the sun that was sinking in.Immediately, this fiery power fused into the Golden Crow's mouth. Its eyes opened slightly but it seemed like it could not open it completely. However, the gap that only opened slightly revealed a resplendent light.This was the first step in cultivating Golden Crow Refines All Life!It was to awaken the Golden Crow's inheritance seed.The method of awakening was the first mouthful of the sun's aura and… the nourishment of his blood and qi.At the next instant, the Golden Crow, which couldn't completely open its eyes, suddenly sucked into Xu Qing's body. In an instant, it seemed to have transformed into a black hole that tried to absorb Xu Qing's entire body.Xu Qing's body trembled and his qi and blood churned intensely. Strands of them spread out and headed straight for the Golden Crow. As they fused into the Golden Crow and were absorbed by it, Xu Qing's body visibly withered.His firm arms became saggy and his face caved in. His body also shrunk and became thinner, and his clothes were now too large for him.However, his expression was as calm as ever.During these ten days, as Xu Qing studied Golden Crow Refines All Life, he already knew about this situation.He was calm and allowed the Golden Crow fledgling in his body to continue absorbing his qi and blood.Gradually, his body became increasingly withered and he looked like a skeleton. The Golden Crow's absorption had also reached a critical moment and it was trying its best to open its eyes.In reality, the inheritance seed of any emperor-level cultivation art didn't activate immediately after it was formed. Instead, the cultivator would take the initiative to activate it when they were fully prepared. This was because the power needed to open the inheritance seed was too great.Generally speaking, very few people could satisfy the seed on their own. They usually needed the help of the faction behind them which would spare no expense to complete the activation.For example, this Golden Crow Refines All Life. In reality, the qi and blood power needed to activate it was astonishing. Ordinary cultivators couldn't withstand such consumption at all. Once they failed, they would face the danger of being sucked dry.It was also because Xu Qing's body refinement had reached a very high level that his qi and blood were vast. That was why he could last until now. If it was anyone else, they would probably be sucked dry in an instant.However, even so, Xu Qing showed signs of being unable to hold on. He noticed that almost all of his flesh and blood were shriveled up like a dried corpse. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes as he circulated the Mountains and Seas Art and the Ba shadow manifested behind him.As soon as this Ba shadow appeared, it roared at the sky. The lava under its dry and cracked body was boiling. Its aura was astonishing and the power of blood and qi was incomparably dense.At the next instant, the Ba shadow's body swayed and its entire body emitted countless fog of qi and blood which quickly entered Xu Qing's body and surged into the Golden Crow.The Golden Crow's body trembled. Under this huge amount of nutrients, its eyes opened slowly. As for the Ba shadow, it withered rapidly. After more than ten breaths of time, the Ba shadow collapsed and transformed into a large ball of qi and blood that surged into Xu Qing's body.The Golden Crow trembled and tried its best to completely open its eyes. However, it seemed that even with the majestic qi and blood Xu Qing had gained now, it was still a little short.This caused the Golden Crow to be just a step away from completely opening its eyes.A strange glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. Without any hesitation, he lifted his right hand and pressed it on the deck at the side. Immediately, the suction force spread out of his palm and directly spread to the core area of the magic ship, which was… where the flesh of Binding was!The instant he came into contact with Binding's flesh, Xu Qing's body shook. An astonishingly dense qi and blood spread out from Binding's flesh and crazily surged into his body.After being swallowed by the Golden Crow, it finally gained the energy it needed. Its eyes opened completely and it let out a cry.This sound contained the power of the Dao!After it spread out from Xu Qing's body, the surface of the sea in all directions fluctuated intensely. Waves rose and fell in all directions with Xu Qing's magic ship as the center, like a small tsunami!If one looked at this scene from above, as the waves swept in all directions, it seemed to form a strange painting.This painting seemed to be of a huge eye.The eye of the Golden Crow!As for Xu Qing's magic ship, it was the pupil of the Golden Crow's eye.Although Xu Qing's entire body was withered, his eyes were bright like the stars. When his messy hair fluttered in the wind, he looked like…Like a demon or a devil!

Chapter 252 Locking The Mosasaur!
The sea rumbled.As the waves spread out, Xu Qing, who was sitting cross-legged on the magic ship, slowly trembled. His breathing became even more hurried and the coldness in his eyes quickly turned into madness.This was because he was hungry!He felt a hunger like never before!One source of this hunger was his withered body; it needed a large amount of replenishment before it could return to normal. Even the purple crystal couldn't help him with this.The purple crystal could speed up the recovery of his injuries but it couldn't provide him with qi, blood, and nutrients from nothing.Another source of this hunger was behind Xu Qing!Behind him was an empty space that looked like there was nothing there. However, regardless of whether it was the Diamond Sect's ancestor or the shadow, they were extremely nervous now. They could sense that there seemed to be great danger and malevolence hidden behind Xu Qing.Xu Qing knew that there wasn't nothing behind him.To be precise, what made the Diamond Sect's ancestor and shadow feel intense fear and nervousness was his back. As the Golden Crow opened its eyes earlier, it formed a totemic tattoo.The tattoo had the appearance of the Golden Crow and emitted waves of soul-stirring aura.This was the second stage of activating the inheritance seed!Xu Qing had studied the information about Golden Crow Refines All Life in the past ten days and was understood that activating its inheritance seed required two steps.The first step was to stimulate the inheritance seed and transform it into a totemic tattoo that would be imprinted on his body.The second step was to let this totemic tattoo manifest outside and form the shadow of qi and blood. Only then would the inheritance seed be completely activated!The second step required a large amount of blood and qi to nourish it, so he felt hungry!Amidst his hurried breathing, Xu Qing's eyes were bloodshot. He turned his head and looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled. He felt as though the other party wanted to devour him. As he trembled, he hurriedly revealed his body and deliberately became more transparent, indicating that he didn't have qi and blood.Xu Qing shifted his gaze and looked at the shadow.The shadow also trembled under his gaze."Send them over." Due to the withering of his body, Xu Qing's voice was extremely hoarse. The shadow didn't hesitate at all as it swung its part that had fused into the sea. Immediately, a huge torpedo scad broke through the surface of the water and was sent to Xu Qing.Xu Qing stared at the torpedo scad. The totemic tattoo on his back suddenly heated up, as though it wanted to transform. However, it couldn't do it yet. It could only transform into golden feathers like phoenix feathers around Xu Qing.These feathers spun rapidly around him, forming a suction force that swept toward the torpedo scad.At the next instant, the thousand-foot-long torpedo scad's body shook as its qi and blood left its body.This blood and qi gathered together and formed a blood sphere that was hundreds of feet wide. It continued to contract and be refined until 99% of it dissipated, forming a drop of light golden blood.The golden phoenix feathers enveloped it and absorbed it. At the same time, Xu Qing waved his hand and a ball of black fire enveloped the torpedo scad, extracting its soul.The shadow couldn't help but take a deep breath as well, swallowing the spirit energy filled with anomalous substances.It was as though they were eating. Very soon, the shadow sent the second sea beast over, followed by the third and fourth.In the past ten days, after Xu Qing studied Golden Crow Refines All Life, he had intentionally reared some sea beasts. Hence, very soon, the phoenix feathers formed by the totemic tattoo on his back absorbed 23 sea beasts.As the phoenix feathers absorbed the qi and blood, not only did they reveal more parts, but they also provided nourishment to Xu Qing, causing him to no longer be so shriveled and recover a little.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ  He could clearly sense that his physical strength had improved a little from his previously stagnant state. His speed was faster and his strength was greater. At the same time, he also had a strange perception.This perception seemed to be the resonance of some spells. Xu Qing vaguely felt that he didn't need to perform hand seals to use some spells he had never learned before.However, after he tried, he couldn't do it."Could this be seizing the race's talent mentioned by Golden Crow Refines All Life? I've refined too little now, so the spells can't take shape!"Xu Qing wanted to ponder on it, but his hunger had only eased slightly which did not give him time to think too much. His eyes were bloodshot as he stood up and kept the magic ship before stepping into the sea.The instant he entered the sea, Xu Qing directly activated the Mystic Brilliance Form. The totemic tattoo on his back emitted an aura of intimidation, causing the pressure emitted by Xu Qing to be extremely heavy.The Diamond Sect's ancestor beside him was covered in lightning. The lightning patterns on the black iron stick flickered as he followed on Xu Qing's left. The shadow spread out and fused into the surroundings. One could faintly see over a hundred eyes filling the surroundings. As they opened, the outline of a large tree could be seen.Right now, Xu Qing's overall combat strength had long surpassed the past. Although he still couldn't be unscrupulous in the Forbidden Sea, he could already dominate an area to a certain extent.The sea rumbled and torrents surged under the sea. Xu Qing instantly disappeared into the distance and began to kill.He needed more sea beasts and more origin blood. Only then could he alleviate this frenzied hunger. Only then could he allow his inheritance seed to complete the second stage and completely activate it. Time passed day by day. Half a month later.In a remote area on the Forbidden Sea, the seawater suddenly churned and exploded. A huge mosasaur with a body of more than 5,000 feet leaped out.Its sinister appearance, terrifying aura, and sharp teeth that were still exposed even though its mouth was tightly shut made it a nightmare for most merchant ships and cultivators in the Forbidden Sea!Mosasaurs were clearly marked on the Seven Blood Eyes' sea record. They were top-notch predatory beasts in the Forbidden Sea. Their ferocious and terrifying bodies coupled with the power of mutation caused their combat strength to be extremely astonishing.This mosasaur was even more extraordinary. The moment it leaped out of the sea, one could see two balls of red flames burning in its body. This was a mosasaur that had cultivated to the level of two balls of life fire.The aura was so strong that the instant it appeared, rumbling sounds rang out in all directions.An area of 10,000 feet of the sea exploded. However, the mosasaur's eyes weren't filled with its usual coldness but deep fear.If one took a closer look, they would see a totemic mark crawling on its stomach.This mark looked like a large tree. Its hundred eyes were opening and closing like large mouths, crazily devouring the mosasaur's shadow.At the same time, a black iron stick surrounded by lightning whistled out from under the broken surface of the sea and pierced through the mosasaur's body.The mosasaur's body trembled violently and the part that was penetrated directly exploded. The intense pain made it want to wail.However… its mouth couldn't open!The wails couldn't be voiced out, so they turned into whimpers. As the sunlight shone on it, one could clearly see the figure of a youth standing in its mouth!This youth wore a purple Daoist robe and was standing between the mosasaur's teeth. His hair was black and had a faint luster like that of jade. One could see water droplets on his hair.As the mosasaur swayed violently, the youth's long hair fluttered in the wind and the water droplets that were as black as ink fell.Some of it landed on his face and flowed down his porcelain-like skin, revealing his face under the sunlight.It was an extremely beautiful face. His long brows were like willows and his body was like a jade tree. His long black hair fluttered behind his neck, giving a feeling of wild beauty.His eyes were filled with a demonic intent, and the demonic part wasn't just his face that would make one infatuated but also the mysterious aura he emitted.He lifted one hand and pulled the mosasaur's upper teeth, while his feet stabbed into the mosasaur's lower teeth.He was using his own strength to lock the mosasaur's mouth tightly, preventing it from opening!This youth was none other than Xu Qing!In the past half a month, he had killed a lot of sea beasts and the totemic tattoo on his back was not far from completing the second stage. Moreover, as the Golden Crow symbol devoured the origin blood, he became increasingly powerful under its nourishment.Not only had his body returned to normal, but the increase in his strength and speed had far surpassed what it had been in the past. In fact, just his physical strength now was enough to make the mosasaur unable to struggle and speak.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes and the black fiendish fire in his body spread out, enveloping the mosasaur. At the same time, the totemic tattoo on his back transformed into countless golden phoenix feathers.These phoenix feathers continued to spin, unleashing a suction force to refine the mosasaur.The mosasaur whimpered and struggled with all its might, falling back to the surface of the sea. The instant it fell, a plesiosaur rushed out from the sea and slammed the mosasaur fiercely.Although the plesiosaur quickly collapsed, with this obstruction, the black fiendish fire completely covered the mosasaur. The power of Golden Crow Refines All Life was also completely activated at this moment.A mournful roar rang out from between the mosasaur's teeth. Its body emitted endless qi and blood that was continuously gathered and refined. Finally, it turned into a ball of origin blood that fused into the phoenix feathers.Its soul appeared in Xu Qing's body and burned like firewood, blasting open his 47th and 48th magic apertures!During this period of time, Xu Qing had killed a lot. Before this, he had opened up to 46th magic aperture.As his magic apertures opened, the magic power in his body surged. At the same time, the nourishment from Golden Crow Refines All Life spread in his body, causing his entire body to emit cracking sounds. His already beautiful face became even more eye-catching and his physical strength increased by a large margin!"As long as I devour a few more sea beasts, the second stage of Golden Crow Refines All Life will be completed. At that time, the totemic symbol will transform and it can be considered my emperor-level cultivation art. It will truly fuse into my body and can't be taken away."As he mumbled, Xu Qing left the place. As for the mosasaur that had lost everything and turned into a dried corpse, it sank to the bottom of the sea. The shadow quickly spread out and hurriedly followed Xu Qing. At the same time, it emitted a feeling of frustration.It felt that its shadow devouring was too slow… Before it could show its might, the mosasaur was killed. Hence, it transmitted some grievances to the Diamond Sect's ancestor at the side.It was rare for the Diamond Sect's ancestor to not take the opportunity to fool the shadow. He lifted his head and looked at the departing Xu Qing. He looked at the back of the youth whose long hair fluttered in the sunlight and purple air draped over his body. His heart was already in turmoil.He had witnessed Xu Qing's killing, Xu Qing's madness, Xu Qing's intense attraction to the opposite sex, and the other party's path of continuously becoming stronger.All of this caused a thought to surface intensely in his mind."This is the main character in the books!""If there's a chance, I'll record it down and publish a book in the future!"

Chapter 253 Brother Xu Qing
As Xu Qing sped through the Forbidden Sea and rapidly absorbed sea beasts one after another, there were three huge black wooden ancient warships whistling through the sky some distance away from him.These three warships that emitted an ancient aura looked like three giant logs from afar.They shone with a black light barrier that sealed all the aura inside, making it almost impossible for outsiders to sense what was inside. At the same time, it also made it very difficult to recognize their origins.In reality, they were Sea Corpse Race's flying warships that had been covered up.The fuel of such a warship was anomalous substances, so to a certain extent, they could continue flying for an extremely long time by absorbing the anomalous substances in the world.On these three Sea Corpse Race ships, there were about a hundred Sea Corpse Race cultivators. Most of them were Qi Condensation cultivators, and only four of them emitted Foundation Building aura.These four weren't ordinary Foundation Building cultivators. They had all formed their life fire. A white-robed Sea Corpse Race member stood on the leading ship. Although he hadn't activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, the aura of the two fires was still obvious.He was clearly the leader of the cultivators on these three warships. At that moment, he was staring into the distance with a cold expression. He stood there like a piece of ice, as though it was very difficult for anything to attract his attention.Beside him was a young girl.This young girl was also from the Sea Corpse Race. Her appearance was that of a human. Clearly, she had lived a luxurious life when she was alive and her status was extremely high after she was transformed. Hence, not only did she not emit any corpse poison, but her skin was also snow-white without any livor mortis spots.Her appearance was also very good-looking, revealing a hint of innocence.The intelligence in her eyes was much more than that of an ordinary Sea Corpse Race member. In fact, if she was placed in a crowd, it would be almost impossible to tell that she was from the Sea Corpse Race if one didn't take a closer look.At that moment, she was holding the arm of the white-robed Sea Corpse Race member and speaking coquettishly."Brother Xu Qing, please tell me how exactly you found me? I was clearly very careful in hiding my identity."The white-robed Sea Corpse Race member shook his head when he heard this. However, he really couldn't withstand the soft pleading of the young girl beside him. Hence, after the young girl took out a black stone, he kept it before calmly speaking."Third Princess, knowledge is priceless. Since you respect knowledge so much, I'll tell you. Before I became a member of the Seven Blood Eyes, I was a disciple of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes. I had learned some small spells before which allowed me to see through the princess' identity.""Princess, the king is very anxious, so he issued this mission to find you. Please don't make things difficult for me. It won't be long before we can return to the clan's territory. Don't casually throw things anymore. It won't be good if you provoke an existence you can't provoke." The white-robed Sea Corpse Race looked calmly at the young girl beside him."Alright, but Brother Xu Qing, don't forget that you promised me that you would transfer over and become my exclusive Dao Protector after we return to the clan. Brother Xu Qing, I really like your personality and feel that you're very special. I asked you a question but you actually want me to pay with the bizarre stone before answering. The other clansmen don't dare to do this.""And those words of yours, such as knowledge being priceless and respecting knowledge, I like them very much. They feel so special." The young girl smiled coquettishly.The white-robed youth placed his hands behind his back and looked into the distance as he calmly replied."I won't go back on my word. As long as the princess allows me to complete the mission, forget about becoming a Dao Protector, even if the princess wants me to become your male pet, it's fine. If I go back on my word, I'll be poisoned and be struck by lightning!""Can you really be my boy toy, Brother Xu Qing?" The third princess' eyes lit up."Of course!" White Robe coughed lightly.At the same time… in the Forbidden Sea in the distance, Xu Qing's entire body trembled and a vigilant glint appeared in his eyes. He stared at the pitch-black bottom of the sea in front of him and slowly retreated.At the bottom of the sea in his vision, there was a group of illusory and blurry figures moving toward a city.There were a large number of buildings in this city and countless figures could be seen shuttling in and out. There were even sounds of bustling activity. There were also many shops and street stalls in the city.At first glance, it was not much different from the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes. It was quite lively.However, this scene caused Xu Qing to be extremely vigilant. Even with his current cultivation and combat strength, he still felt his heart skip a beat and felt an intense sense of danger.This was a ghost city.What gave Xu Qing a sense of danger wasn't the ghosts in the city but the city itself.He immediately left without hesitation. The ghost city didn't seem to be interested in him and didn't chase after him.However, Xu Qing still chose to move in a different direction. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he was far away."With my current cultivation, I can't explore the dangers at the bottom of the sea too often."This was already the second existence Xu Qing had seen during this period of time that caused him to feel intense danger. Previously, he had seen a huge head floating up from the bottom of the sea and rushing out of the surface of the sea. It then dove back into the sea again like it was playing.This cycle continued and waves of joyous laughter could be heard.That time was the same as this time. Xu Qing stayed far away and there were no conflicts. However, Xu Qing wasn't sure if his good luck would continue. The third time he encountered such a thing might be when the danger descended on him. After pondering for a moment, he left the bottom of the sea and took out the magic ship. He relied on the shadow and his Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale to observe and hunt."The second stage of Golden Crow Refines All Life is almost completed. It's best to be cautious for now." When Xu Qing thought of this, he sat down and spread his sense under the sea, landing on his Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale.His natal dragonwhale no longer had the appearance of a plesiosaur. Instead, it had transformed into a body similar to a mosasaur. This was something Xu Qing had comprehended after killing that mosasaur."It's a pity that I only killed one. Otherwise, it could have resembled the mosasaur even more." Xu Qing closed his eyes.Seven days passed in the blink of an eye. n(0)velbIn[.]nEt Xu Qing had been out at sea for several months, and the sea area he was in was far away from the merfolk island battlefield. He didn't know how the war had progressed, but he could see that his overall ranking on his identity token had changed from just below 50th to below 100th.This meant that the intensity of the war had increased.However, Xu Qing didn't care about these at the moment. During these seven days, his Golden Crow Refines All Life was infinitely close to saturation after devouring some sea beasts."Absorbing another Foundation Building sea beast will completely activate the inheritance seed!" Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. His mind sank onto the Forbidden Sea Mosasaur under the sea and he began to search for suitable sea beasts.The shadow also dispersed a lot of the shadow eyes on the way and cooperated in the search. As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he was searching under the sea with the mosasaur.The instant Xu Qing's mind sank into it, his mind suddenly stirred. He abruptly opened his eyes and looked at the sky.It was dusk. The red glow filled the sky like autumn leaves. And within the red glow, in the distant horizon, three strange black warships that were like giant logs were reflected in Xu Qing's eyes.Xu Qing looked at the three warships, but he couldn't sense any fluctuations coming from them nor could he see the figures inside. The records of the Seven Blood Eyes didn't mention such warships either.Hence, Xu Qing couldn't recognize them immediately.However, he was very vigilant. Although the other party looked like they were just passing by, not only did Xu Qing activate the magic boat's full defense, but he also chose to sink into the sea.If they were really passing by and saw Xu Qing evading them, there was a high chance that they wouldn't attack. Even if they really attacked, Xu Qing was prepared to counterattack or speed up his escape.However, the instant Xu Qing's magic ship sank to the sea, a woman's hand suddenly stretched out from the front of the three ships in the sky.She was holding a black pearl in her hand. After she gently released it, the pearl suddenly erupted with lightning and headed toward Xu Qing at an astonishing speed.Its aura was so strong that it shook the heavens and the earth. One could even see a rune sealed in the pearl. Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he controlled the magic ship to leave. However, at the next instant, his expression changed.This was because the rune in the pearl flashed once, causing the bead to seemingly teleport and appear under the sea above Xu Qing's magic ship.This speed exceeded Xu Qing's expectations. It was too late to control the magic ship to dodge. At the next instant, the loud collision stirred up the surrounding seawater to collapse and spread. Xu Qing's magic ship collapsed and countless broken pieces rose toward the surface of the sea.The scattered fragments on the surface of the sea were densely packed, as though the magic ship had completely collapsed."Aiya, it's so fragile. It was shattered by just one lightning. It's not fun, but the way it exploded was so beautiful." In the sky, the Sea Corpse Race girl lay at the edge of the ship's railing and lowered her head to take a look.However, White Robe's breathing paused slightly and a hint of strangeness appeared in his eyes. He looked at the disintegrated magic ship below from the edge. A few breaths later, he let out a long sigh."Third Princess, why do you have to do this? I just want to complete the mission. Why do you have to make it so difficult!! Can't you keep a low profile? What if you provoked a murderous fiend?"White Robe seemed to be extremely depressed. He took out an apple from his robe and took a bite."Brother Xu Qing, what's wrong with you? Isn't it just a Seven Blood Eyes' ship? Besides, just one of the divine lightning given by that dastardly father of mine shattered it. What's the big deal?" The young girl smiled and her eyes narrowed like crescent moons.White Robe shook his head, looking like he didn't want to speak. He sighed and couldn't be bothered with the way the other party addressed her father. At that moment, he controlled the warship to speed up.Very soon, these three black wooden-looking warships whistled into the distance.At the same time, as the three warships left, the fragments of the magic ship on the surface of the sea suddenly spread out as the waves rose.Under the surface of the sea, there was a ship that was one size smaller than before but even more sinister. It looked like the body of a sea lizard and was speeding in the direction of the three black warships in the sky!The part that was destroyed earlier was the outer shell. With Zhang San's unique method, the outer shell of Xu Qing's magic ship could shatter and confuse the enemy.Xu Qing looked at the sky through the seawater with an ugly expression. Killing intent rose in his eyes."Sea Corpse Race?"

Chapter 254 The Golden Crow Descends
When the black pearl was thrown from the black wooden ship, Xu Qing sensed a trace of fluctuations of the anomalous substances of the Sea Corpse Race in the sky.This allowed him to make a judgment that these three ships most likely belonged to the Sea Corpse Race. Xu Qing didn't have any good impression of the Sea Corpse Race, and he had killed too many of their people.What happened today was an undeserved calamity for him. Although the black pearl couldn't cause him any harm, it was actually very powerful. Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  It was comparable to the full-strength attack of a life fire cultivator!The rune sealed inside was even more profound.The scene he had seen earlier appeared in Xu Qing's mind. The rune only flashed for a moment but it actually allowed the black bead to teleport and appear on his magic ship.That was why Xu Qing was unable to react in time."If the might of that pearl reaches two or even three fires… It is a treasure!"Coldness rose in Xu Qing's eyes.He understood that for a cultivator to casually throw out such a one-time-use treasure, either their cultivation base wasn't simple, so they had too many treasures.Or, their cultivation was ordinary but their identity was extraordinary.He felt that the probability of the latter was higher."They should have Dao Protectors."Xu Qing didn't retract his gaze. The magic ship that looked like a sea lizard sped under the sea, chasing after the black dots formed by the three ships in the sky.Before he knew if there were higher-level experts on the ship, Xu Qing didn't plan to act rashly.He was used to lurking and silently observing. At that moment, he was like a hunter, searching for the weaknesses of his prey and judging their strength.At the same time, among the three black wooden ships in the sky, the white-robed Sea Corpse Race member at the front sighed.He stood at the edge of the ship and looked at the sea below with frustration.He could faintly sense an aura locking onto their three ships.This aura… was very familiar to him."Brother Xu Qing, don't be unhappy. I'm already very low-key. Just now, I planned to throw three divine lightning down but I only threw one…"The third princess secretly glanced at the white-robed Sea Corpse Race member. Seeing that the other party was ignoring her, she took a few steps forward and grabbed the white-robed person's arm, shaking it a few times."Alright, alright. I won't throw anything randomly on the way, okay? Brother Xu Qing, don't be angry. Why are you frowning? What are you thinking about?"When the white-robed Sea Corpse Race member heard the name Xu Qing, he sighed again and turned to look at the third princess."I'm thinking about how to persuade that guy to not kill you. I'm also thinking about how to make that guy not know what I secretly did. Otherwise, he might flip out.""Brother Xu Qing, I don't understand what you're saying…"The third princess's smile was pure and sweet.The white-robed Sea Corpse Race member waved his hand and couldn't be bothered to say anything else.He sighed inwardly. He had discovered that contribution points were hard to obtain, so he tried to resort to dubious methods. Hence, he accepted this mission to find the third princess and successfully found and attracted her.As long as he sent her back to the Sea Corpse Race, not only would his contribution points be enough to exchange for a high-level corpse heart, but he could also go to the Sea Corpse Race's ancestral vault to complete his second plan after obtaining the third princess' trust.Moreover, he had already finished most of his plan. He was only less than a month away from entering the Sea Corpse Race's territory.However… this princess of the Sea Corpse Race insisted on throwing such a divine lightning pearl.Just as White Robe was sighing with emotion, he suddenly exclaimed softly and stared at the sea.He sensed that Xu Qing's aura had actually loosened and given up on following them."What's going on? Did this kid's personality change? Or is there something more important?"White Robe was surprised. He observed for a long time until the black wooden ship got far away. Another three days passed before he finally confirmed that Xu Qing hadn't followed."Strange."Although he was curious, White Robe heaved a sigh of relief. He wasn't afraid that Xu Qing would find out about his plan to head to the Sea Corpse Race. He was just feeling guilty about impersonating the other party's identity.'It doesn't matter. I did this to find him a Dao companion. That's right, I did good. As a superior, I care about my subordinate's personal life and personally went out to find a female companion for him. He should thank me for this!'White Robe coughed. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that it made sense. However, he still sent out the order to speed up.However, the sea lizard magic ship Xu Qing was on… was still following!It was just that the shadow was covering the magic ship.Three days ago, when Xu Qing locked onto the ships and chased after them, he sensed that he had been discovered. Hence, he pretended to leave. In reality, he secretly controlled the shadow to envelop the ship and completely fused the ship's aura with the anomalous substances in the Forbidden Sea.After that, he continued to follow and observe. This time, he didn't feel that he had been discovered.This matter also allowed him to probe some information. For example… there was a high chance that there were no Golden Core cultivators in these three black wooden ships. In fact, there shouldn't even be any three fires cultivator. Otherwise, when the other party sensed his aura three days ago, they would have immediately attacked him. How could they let him leave?During these three days, Xu Qing also observed other things. Firstly, he saw through the concealment of the appearance of the three ships through his meticulous observation.Secondly, the other party's speed increased.All of this combined made Xu Qing 80% certain that there were no experts who were too confident in their cultivation bases on these three ships."Since that's the case…"Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. On one hand, he was very angry because of the black pearl from before. On the other hand, since Xu Qing had seen the nutrients needed to open his magic apertures, there was no reason for him to let them go.In addition… his Golden Crow Refines All Life's progress was delayed by the other party. They had an obligation to help him complete the last nourishment for Golden Crow Refines All Life.Only then would it be fair and reasonable.On the third night, when the sky was pitch-black and the moonlight was dim, Xu Qing stood under the sea on the magic ship and performed a series of hand seals with both hands before pressing down fiercely.The magic ship buzzed. The sea lizard's wings spread out and its hundreds of feet long body headed straight for the surface of the sea.The instant it broke out of the sea and flew into the sky, the sea lizard opened its mouth. The golden light on its entire body flickered and gathered before shooting out of its mouth.This golden beam of light was an attack condensed from the divinity contained in the sea lizard magic ship.As soon as it appeared, the sky changed color and the wind and clouds stirred.The dark night sky shone with the astonishingly fast and dazzling golden light. It headed straight for… the second of the three black wooden ships!The golden light immediately reached its target. No matter how the ship's defense was, it was useless. In the blink of an eye, the golden beam pierced through the barrier and struck the ship.The entire ship trembled intensely. When its shape was twisting, the surface of the sea erupted again. A huge mosasaur that was more than 3,000 feet long broke out of the sea and roared at the sky, crashing fiercely toward the first black wooden ship at the front!At the same time, Xu Qing's figure also leaped up from the magic ship. The life lantern in his body was ignited. The flames on his entire body overflowed into the sky and his speed instantly reached the extreme. He headed straight for… the last ship!As for the shadow and the Diamond Sect's ancestor, they sped toward the second ship that was bombarded by the divinity attack.All of this took a long time to describe but in reality, it happened in the blink of an eye.In an instant, the sky rumbled endlessly. Xu Qing immediately reached the third ship.The moment he got close, he slammed into the ship's defense.Cracking sounds spread in all directions and densely-packed cracks appeared in front of Xu Qing. After that, the barrier shattered into pieces and Xu Qing barged in.There were more than 30 Sea Corpse Race members on this ship. Among them, other than an early-stage Foundation Building cultivator who had formed a life fire, there were two Foundation Building cultivators who hadn't formed their life fire. The rest were all at the Qi Condensation Realm!At this moment, these people's expressions were filled with horror and their movements were extremely slow. Even the life fire in the early stage Foundation Building cultivator's body was ignited just now.Xu Qing coldly swept his gaze over and didn't stop at all. He took a step forward and arrived in front of the Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race who had ignited his life fire.The instant the terror and despair appeared in the other party's eyes, Xu Qing had already pressed his palm on the other party's brows.The Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art circulated!With a cry, the totemic tattoo on his back transformed into countless phoenix feathers and enveloped the early stage Foundation Building cultivator. In the blink of an eye, as the two cultivation arts circulated at the same time, the Sea Corpse Race's body withered rapidly.His soul was extracted and his origin blood was also refined.It was a ball of dark blue blood. When the phoenix feathers around Xu Qing fought to devour it, Xu Qing's body suddenly trembled. The place where the totemic tattoo was branded on his back emitted an intense heat.Xu Qing's mind stirred. Before this, his Golden Crow Refines All Life was only a strand away from completing the second stage of the inheritance seed. Now that it had swallowed the origin blood of the Sea Corpse Race, the inheritance seed was finally activated!At the next instant, a cry that seemed to be able to pierce through the nine heavens rang out from behind Xu Qing. The phoenix feathers in his surroundings instantly burned, transforming into black flames that gathered behind him.Countless phoenix feathers and countless black flames gathered behind Xu Qing, forming a majestic sea of fire. This sea of fire was hundreds of feet tall and the light illuminated everything here.The cry rang out again. This time, it was even clearer. It was formed from the black sea of fire.The instant it spread out… this black sea of fire suddenly rose into the sky and erupted. A black divine bird took shape inside and soared into the sky!!It was as though it was born from flames, as though it had been formed over time. An ancient intent erupted from its body, causing the night to feel like it was about to boil!From afar, this divine bird had the head of a crow, the body of a crane, the tail of a phoenix, and had three legs!As it rose into the air, black flames flowed past its body and gathered at its tail, connecting with the sea of fire, forming a shocking fan-shaped fire!It was extremely beautiful and filled with profundity.At the next instant, the black Golden Crow spiraled and headed straight for Xu Qing, who was standing in the air.As it cried, it got close to Xu Qing and circled around him with an intimate feeling, as though it was dancing.Wherever it passed, the tail flames would form waves of fire, reflecting Xu Qing's face clearly. It then moved below Xu Qing.At that moment, almost every Sea Corpse Race member on the three ships in the sky was shaken to the core. When they looked at Xu Qing, their eyes felt an unprecedented piercing pain.It was as though Xu Qing had become an existence that couldn't be looked at directly amidst the cries and encirclement of the black Golden Crow!

Chapter 255 Trenchant (1)
On the first ship ahead, the third princess' eyes were wide open and she felt a piercing pain, but she still tried her best to see everything clearly even though tears were flowing down her eyes.There was a hint of fascination in her expression, as though she was watching the most beautiful scene in this world.As for White Robe at the side, he was also stunned for a moment. He looked at Xu Qing and an even more intense sense of urgency rose in his mind.'What the hell… How did this kid become stronger again? This Golden Crow… Could this be the emperor-level cultivation art that is circulated on the Forbidden Sea?!' p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At the thought of this, White Robe immediately approached the third princess and hurriedly spoke in a low voice. "Princess, this kid cultivates an extremely vicious cultivation art. I once read about it in an ancient book. It's called the Dark Name Fate Guiding Art. It is quite powerful. Once he knows the enemy's name and uses this art, he can instantly take someone's life. You must not say my name later. Just call me Brother!"As White Robe quickly reminded, screams rang out from the surroundings.On the ship Xu Qing was on, the black Golden Crow swung its tail as it circled around.Immediately, the black sea of tail flames spread in all directions, transforming into chains of black flames. They were like terrifying fire snakes that rushed toward all the Sea Corpse Race cultivators on the entire ship.After these chains got close to their targets, they quickly wrapped around their bodies and lifted them into the air.The huge cultivation gap caused the struggles of these Sea Corpse Race members to be useless. All of them were swept up by the black flame chains and surrounded in all directions. From afar, these chains looked like the continuation of the Golden Crow's tail!As they were lifted to the air, these Sea Corpse Race members all let out mournful cries.Their bodies were withering and traces of qi and blood were continuously extracted from their entire bodies, gathering toward the Golden Crow that was moving in the air behind Xu Qing.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He lifted his right foot and stomped down. The terrifying physical strength coupled with the might of the life lantern caused the ship under his feet to directly collapse. It shattered into countless pieces that scattered down from the sky.Xu Qing's purple Daoist robe fluttered in the wind. As his long hair danced with the wind, the black Golden Crow on his back rose and covered him.The fan-shaped tail flames illuminated the surroundings. Numerous dried corpses were wrapped around the black-flame chains.Coupled with Xu Qing's demonic face, no matter who saw Xu Qing at this moment, they would feel as though they had seen a demon.The strange glint in the third princess' eyes intensified. She had never seen such a person.However, Xu Qing didn't care about the third princess who was only at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm. His gaze swept past her and landed on White Robe beside her.White Robe, who was suppressing the mosasaur with one hand, also turned his head to stare at Xu Qing.Xu Qing looked at him and fell silent.White Robe also looked at Xu Qing with some awkwardness. Just as the atmosphere became strange, a strange laugh suddenly rang out. Everyone's gazes turned to the place where the laughter came from.It was coming from the second ship. As Xu Qing looked over, he saw a bolt of lightning whistling out from the ship and floating in the air.It was the black iron stick.Lightning filled it and flowed continuously. From time to time, lightning would jump up from it, forming lightning cracks in all directions.At the same time, there were also lightning runes flickering on the iron stick. Every rune contained the feeling of Dao, causing the black iron to look incomparably gorgeous like a supreme treasure!In fact, it would make others feel that once they had it, they wouldn't abandon it.There was a bell tied to this black iron stick. This bell was clearly enhanced by lightning and a large number of souls were sealed on it. These souls were clearly from the Sea Corpse Race. All of them let out cries of pain but they couldn't escape.Clearly, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was very considerate. He knew that Xu Qing needed souls. Hence, after rushing into the second ship, he relied on his Lightning Spirit Body to kill while absorbing the souls with the Living Soul Bell and sealing them with lightning.This way, not only could he show his thoughtfulness, but he could also show his strength.As for the person who laughed strangely, it was clearly impossible for it to be the Diamond Sect's ancestor.At that moment, a figure walked out of the cabin behind the Diamond Sect's ancestor.This figure was from the Sea Corpse Race. There was also a ball of life fire burning in his body. He looked like a middle-aged male human cultivator. His body was skinny and the livor mortis spots on his body were very obvious.He wore a tattered Daoist robe and the corners of his mouth curled up with a hint of pride. As he walked, he let out a sinister laugh.However, his appearance gave off a strange feeling!This was because his footsteps seemed a little uncoordinated, as though he had just learned to walk. At the same time, his expression was clearly arrogant but his eyes revealed extreme horror.This fear was extremely intense and contradicted his expression, forming a strange scene.He walked to the edge of the ship and stood on the handrail.His gaze swept disdainfully across White Robe, the third princess, and all the Sea Corpse Race members on the first ship. When his gaze landed on Xu Qing, his expression turned solemn. He knelt on one knee in front of Xu Qing and revealed a respectful expression.After that, he lifted his hands and placed them on his neck, twisting it ruthlessly.Amidst the horror of the Sea Corpse Race members on the first ship, this person actually broke his own neck.

Chapter 256 Trenchant (2)
This wasn't the end. He tore off his head. The expression of the head that had left its body was still filled with arrogance. As he cackled, he raised his hand and stabbed it into his stomach, pinching the burning life fire and... extinguishing it!At the next instant, his body trembled and popping sounds echoed. All the magic apertures in his body were crushed by him until his entire body finally shattered into pieces and scattered on the ground.This scene was too grotesque and bizarre, causing the other Sea Corpse Race members to have trouble breathing. They, who were not easily moved, felt fear.Xu Qing frowned slightly. He could naturally tell that the shadow had devoured the shadow of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator and controlled it. What made him frown was that the shadow had wasted a soul.However, Xu Qing didn't say anything else. He turned and walked toward the first ship.As he got closer, the Sea Corpse Race members on the first ship trembled. It was unknown who was the first to retreat, but in the next instant, these Sea Corpse Race members all leaped up to escape.However, the Golden Crow behind Xu Qing let out a cry. Immediately, even more black flame chains erupted from its body and rapidly rushed toward these Sea Corpse Race members, instantly entangling them. Miserable cries echoed in all directions.Xu Qing didn't bother with them as he stepped onto the ship.After that, he lifted his right hand and pointed at the young girl who was still trying her best to keep her eyes open despite the piercing pain in her eyes. Her expression carried a hint of sickly fascination.In an instant, lightning rumbled and the black iron stick appeared. Its speed was so fast that it arrived in front of the young girl in the blink of an eye. Just as it was about to penetrate her head, White Robe sighed. He flicked the iron stick lightly at an even faster speed.With a buzzing sound, the black iron stick suddenly trembled and was swept hundreds of feet away by the force of this flick. It then immediately returned unscathed. The murderous aura on it was even denser and its lightning bolts crackled crazily.White Robe stared deeply at the black iron stick and then at Xu Qing's feet. After that, he looked at the Golden Crow behind Xu Qing. These things gave him a headache.Finally, he looked at Xu Qing and sighed."Fellow Daoist, she's very important to me..."Xu Qing looked at White Robe. From the moment he saw the other party earlier, he guessed that the captain must be using this young girl with an extraordinary identity to complete some crazy plans.Hence, he probed and attacked. As expected, the other party stopped him.Xu Qing wasn't surprised by the captain's words, especially when the other party said the word 'fellow Daoist'. It seemed like he didn't want others to know his identity and it was in line with Xu Qing's judgment. He didn't hesitate and spoke directly."100,000 spirit stones!"White Robe glared and was about to speak when the third princess suddenly laughed."Brother, this little brother is very interesting. I want him to be my Dao Protector too!"As she spoke, the girl lifted her right hand on which was a bracelet. At this moment, it swayed gently and broke into pieces with cracking sounds. After the pieces landed on the ground, they gathered together again and squirmed like a living creature before suddenly expanding, turning into a tall and skinny dried corpse with its eyes closed.This dried corpse's entire body was tied with red straps. At that moment, a baleful aura filled the air. Its eyes also opened, revealing a red glow as it took a step toward Xu Qing.The instant this step landed, there seemed to be an explosion in its body. Two balls of life fire ignited in it, causing red flames to rise from its body. Its speed soared as it charged toward Xu Qing.However, before it could get close, lightning rumbled in the black iron stick. All the lightning runes on it flickered and its speed rose to an astonishing degree as it rushed toward the dried corpse and stabbed it.   n0vel 0nline free at​ nσνEℓnєXт  At the same time, the shadow also silently spread out below the feet of the dried corpse. Over a hundred eyes opened at the same time and looked at the dried corpse.The dried corpse's body suddenly paused and many parts of its body instantly showed signs of rotting. While a large amount of anomalous substances in its body were lost, the black iron stick directly pierced through its neck. It spun around and then penetrated the back of its head.Xu Qing also took a step forward. His speed was so fast that he instantly got close to the dried corpse. His physical strength erupted as he pressed his right hand on the dry corpse's forehead.When his palm moved, whistling sounds rang out in the surroundings, as though his palm strike could not be avoided.The dry corpse let out a low roar and its entire body flickered with red light. It actually forcefully resisted Xu Qing's attack. However, Xu Qing didn't stop at all. He bent his right arm and elbowed the dried corpse's chin.Although the dried corpse could withstand one attack, it couldn't withstand a second attack. Its head directly shattered, revealing flesh and bones. However, it didn't have any spirituality and was like a puppet!This was more obvious when a large number of sticky threads appeared at the shattered places. They seemed to be able to heal the corpse and join the broken parts.It was recovering even with its head shattered. Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He lifted his knee and slammed the corpse hard on its stomach. The puppet retreated. Although its stomach also collapsed, there were clearly more sticky threads and its recovery speed became even faster. It was as though it couldn't be destroyed.Xu Qing let out a cold snort and looked at the puppet that was constantly recovering. He then activated Golden Crow Refines All Life. The Golden Crow behind him let out a sharp cry and leaped up from behind Xu Qing, pouncing fiercely at the puppet.Black flames burned in all directions. The puppet was enveloped by the Golden Crow and its recovery speed was instantly interrupted. The flames continuously burned and refined it.As the Golden Crow's three claws grabbed with all its might, the broken dried corpse's body instantly shattered into pieces and melted.As for the Golden Crow, it stood on top of the disintegrating corpse and fiercely inhaled. Immediately, a drop of blue blood that was so dark that it was almost black flew out of the dried corpse's body and landed in its mouth.This dried corpse was completely refined and turned into ashes.The Golden Crow then returned and encircled Xu Qing. Its tail flames draped over Xu Qing's body and flowed behind him, forming a flaming cloak. At that moment, the wind blew over, causing the flames to flutter in the wind.As for the Golden Crow's body, it stretched out from his right side and stared coldly at the young girl and White Robe.This scene was extremely beautiful and terrifying!"That's great. Little Brother, thank you for helping me get rid of the bracelet my damn father gave me. I thought of many ways previously and kept provoking others but I couldn't kill this thing at all."When the third princess saw this scene, she immediately cheered. Her expression was filled with excitement as she looked at White Robe."Brother Xu Qing, I knew long ago that you're not from the Sea Corpse Race and you didn't want to become my Dao Protector, right? You're so bad. Previously, you even swore that you would become my Dao Protector, and if you go back on your word, you would be struck by lightning... You even lied to me that you would become my boy toy."​ "However, it's fine. Brother Xu Qing, you should be from the Seven Blood Eyes, right? You know this little brother, right? Do you want to use me to infiltrate the Sea Corpse Race? Have you taken a fancy to some supreme treasure or are you going to destroy some secret place? No matter what it is, I can help you. I know a lot of information, but I have a condition. Bring me along!!"A hint of radiance appeared in the third princess' eyes. However, after she finished speaking, she saw that the expression of White Robe had clearly changed. She asked with a puzzled expression."Brother Xu Qing, what's wrong?"Xu Qing looked at the captain expressionlessly. The flames of the life lantern in his body began to rise.

Chapter 257 Crazy Plan
Seeing the flames rising in Xu Qing's body, the captain's expression changed and he hurriedly spoke."Don't kill her. I have great use for her!"Almost at the instant he spoke, Xu Qing's body moved. His speed was so fast that he instantly arrived in front of the third princess who was still pretending to be puzzled. As the third princess' breathing paused, Xu Qing slapped her face.The third princess spat out a mouthful of blood and her body fell to the side of the ship like a kite with a broken string. The ship wall shattered into pieces and her body was also blasted out.However, at the next instant, a black chain spread out from the Golden Crow's tail behind Xu Qing and instantly coiled around her. With a tug, it pulled her back to the ship and threw her in front of the captain.Xu Qing didn't kill her. Otherwise, he would have completely destroyed her with that strike earlier. However, he took her storage bag.When she landed, the third princess spat out another mouthful of blood and more than half of the bones in her body had collapsed. However, there was no fear in her eyes. Instead, there was confusion. As she spat out blood, she asked curiously."He used your name to do many things, but you don't mind? Why hit me instead of him?""Because this is a matter between us brothers and has nothing to do with outsiders. An outsider like you is trying to sow discord. If he doesn't beat you up, who should he beat up? If it was me, I would beat you up too."The captain sighed and squatted in front of the third princess. After lifting one of her hands, he let go. Seeing the third princess' hand lying there bonelessly, he shook his head."They're all shattered. Fortunately, she is still breathing. It's fine as long as she is alive."The third princess still didn't understand. She felt that things shouldn't be like this. Just as she was about to speak, the captain slapped her unconscious and kept her in a special storage bag. Only then did he look at Xu Qing."You swore on my name?" With no more outsiders around, Xu Qing stared at the captain and slowly spoke."It was just a joke, a joke. Eh, Xu Qing, your spirit ticket dropped." The captain's expression was as calm as ever. He touched the ground and a spirit ticket worth 100 spirit stones appeared in his hand. He handed it to Xu Qing with incomparable heartache.Xu Qing took it expressionlessly and continued to stare at the captain."Be struck by lightning?""Haha, how is that possible? Junior Brother, you heard wrongly. How could you believe the words of an outsider? As your senior brother and your superior, I definitely wouldn't do such a thing, just like how you never owed me spirit stones."The captain spoke solemnly."Male toy?" Xu Qing continued.The captain sighed.Xu Qing stared at the captain.A long time later, the captain slapped his forehead and suddenly spoke mysteriously."Xu Qing, let's not talk about this first. I have something good here… I disguised myself as a member of the Sea Corpse Race to obtain a high-level corpse heart.""However, this is only my first target. I have an even more important target. Originally, I felt that my situation did not look good and I might not be able to succeed. However, if we work together, there will definitely be no problem.""Do you know that the Sea Corpse Race has many treasures and many important secret places? The destruction of any secret place will affect the battlefield. Of course, this has nothing to do with us. My target this time is the core holy item of the Sea Corpse Race… the nine ancestral corpse statues!!""Legend has it that the formation of the Sea Corpse Race originated from the nine statues. The material of these nine statues is special and unique in the world.""They are scattered in the Sea Corpse Race's territory and are the source of the transformation of the Sea Corpse Race. The territories they are in are also the holy land for healing for the Sea Corpse Race.""The most important thing is that the experts of the Sea Corpse Race's army are all on the battlefield and their internal defense is weak right now. Although there are some contingency measures, the identity of the young girl you were about to kill is extraordinary. She's the third princess of the Sea Corpse Race. If she brings us there, the Sea Corpse Race won't suspect us immediately. By the time they realize the problem, we'll have already fled far away."When the captain said this, he was beaming with joy. His eyes revealed the madness of risking his life that Xu Qing had seen on the merfolk island before.The captain's words also caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow. He was very clear that only extremely bold people would head to the Sea Corpse Race's territory.And the captain's target in the enemy's territory was actually their core holy item. This was no longer something that could be described with boldness. Even though the Sea Corpse Race was empty now, only crazy people could have such crazy thoughts.Xu Qing cast a deep glance at the captain. He felt that the captain's madness hadn't gotten better. Only a lunatic would do such a thing. Hence, he was about to refuse.The captain spoke again excitedly."Any one of those nine ancestral corpse statues contains astonishing power and extremely dense divinity. Not only are they useful to the Sea Corpse Race, but they also have huge benefits for us human cultivators. They can open many of our magic apertures. I heard that after absorbing one, opening dozens will be a piece of cake!" Xu Qing couldn't help but swallow his words of rejection. His heart pounded.Right now, he had opened 49 magic apertures and there were many cracks in his 50th magic aperture. He wasn't far from opening it, but it was becoming increasingly difficult.  Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Every ten magic apertures were usually considered one level. From the 40th to the 50th magic apertures, the magic apertures could only be opened smoothly by absorbing the soul of a life fire cultivator.In reality, Xu Qing was already progressing very fast. If it wasn't for the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art and this war, it would be impossible for Xu Qing to open his magic apertures so fast.Normally speaking, a Foundation Building cultivator would usually need ten years to form the first ball of life fire. As for forming the second ball of life fire… if one purely relied on daily cultivation, it would take at least 30 years.Moreover, during this process, there was the risk of death and it would take time to resolve the accumulation of anomalous substances. This was also the reason why there weren't many two fire cultivators.As for reaching three fires, it would take even longer.'From 50 to 60… the soul power required will definitely be huge.'Xu Qing pondered. He felt that his cultivation progress was still a little slow, so he was extremely tempted by the ancestral corpse statues that the captain had mentioned. He thought for a moment and looked at the storage bag where the captain had kept the third princess."I don't believe she'll help us.""Don't worry, I can convince her. You don't know but this third princess is a pitiful person. I'm confident!" The captain patted his chest.Xu Qing shook his head. The key to the success of this matter depended on that third princess. Only with her sincere help could they successfully enter the Sea Corpse Race's territory.Only the third princess could lead them through countless protective barriers and inspections and step into the areas where the statues were kept.If there was any mistake in this process, what awaited them would definitely be eternal damnation."No need to worry!" The captain sized up Xu Qing before chuckling."I have a way. I will disguise you as the third princess. Isn't that enough? Besides, I have become familiar with the habits of the third princess. Although I can't say that I know her like the back of my hand, I know her way of speaking and other habits. It will be a stress to deceive them for a long time, there won't be a problem as long as we're fast enough.""Since you know so much, why don't you disguise yourself?" Xu Qing raised his brows and looked at the captain."Vice Captain Xu, I'm your superior!" The captain said solemnly. "Male toy?" Xu Qing replied.The captain instantly relaxed and sighed."Let's make a bet. Whoever loses will dress up!" As he spoke, the captain looked around and suddenly looked at the sea. There was a sea snake swimming rapidly there. It seemed to be lacking in intelligence as it looked fiercely at the ship they were on with hostility."Whoever kills it first will win!" Almost as soon as the captain finished speaking, he attacked. His life fires were ignited and an astonishing cold air erupted. At the same time, it froze the surroundings and enveloped Xu Qing. His body swayed and he headed straight for the sea.At the same time, a huge palm formed on the sea and grabbed fiercely at the sea snake.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and the Golden Crow behind him let out a cry. As the flames erupted, it ignored the captain's cold air and also rushed out. With a wave of his hand, a large hand formed on the sea. Its target wasn't the sea snake but the captain's divine power spell.The two large hands collided. Xu Qing directly collided with the captain in mid-air. In an instant, a monstrous sound resounded in all directions. The black iron stick which had moved at the same time was about to approach the sea snake.At the next instant, the cold air in the surroundings suddenly soared and formed ice in the blink of an eye, sealing the black iron stick. The Diamond Sect's ancestor's expression changed as he couldn't even move.Ice appeared around the sea snake as well. Just as the sea snake was about to be sealed, the Golden Crow let out a cry and a sea of fire rose. As the Golden Crow charged forward, the ice melted.As for Xu Qing, with a wave of his hand, the heavenly saber slashed down. He lit the life lantern and punched out with much faster speed than before due to the enhancement from Golden Crow Refines All Life.This punch formed a shocking force that directly created a vortex in the void in front of him. As it devoured everything, a wisp of corpse poison spread out!The captain's eyes narrowed and he performed a series of hand seals. The explosion sent the captain a few steps back. Xu Qing then rushed over without slowing down."How long has it been? How could you have changed so much? Your physical strength has already reached this level. Coupled with the Mystic Brilliance Form, this is comparable to three fires! Also, what's wrong with this corpse poison? It resembles the Sea Corpse Race more than me? An emperor-level cultivation art is really a bully."A hint of madness appeared in the captain's eyes. In order to make Xu Qing disguise as the third princess and protect his face, he made a decision. His eyes suddenly let out golden light.Under this light, one could see a rhombus-shaped golden rune flickering in his eyes. An aura that surpassed two fires erupted from his body!

Chapter 258 Enchanting Beauty
The second seal, unlocked!The identity of the captain was a mystery. Xu Qing had many guesses about it, and had even wondered if the other party was the first highness of the Seventh Peak.However, to Xu Qing, these guesses only surfaced in his mind occasionally and weren't very important. This was because no matter who the other party was, it wouldn't affect the subtle relationship between them.For example, at this moment, when he saw the captain's aura rising suddenly, Xu Qing's eyes also revealed a ferocious glint. He didn't want to lose either. In fact, he really wanted to see the captain dress up as the third princess.Almost at the instant the captain erupted, the life lantern in Xu Qing's body burned even more intensely. At the next instant, the two of them came into contact again.A rumbling sound erupted into the sky. The captain, who had unlocked the seal, emitted a golden light from his entire body. This light gave Xu Qing the feeling of divinity but it was a little different.Divinity was holy, but the light from the captain carried a strong sense of dominance, as though it could suppress everything.The captain waved his hand, and a sea of golden light transformed into a large hand that suppressed Xu Qing. "You will be the third princess!" The captain roared.Xu Qing's entire body trembled violently and he kept retreating. Under the envelopment of the sea of light, he could sense the madness and extreme domineeringness of it, causing him to almost suffocate. Even the circulation of his cultivation was affected and the life fires in his body swayed intensely.From afar, Xu Qing's figure was less than one hundredth of the large hand formed by the golden light. Under the pressure of the large hand, his body was pressed toward the sea.This strength surpassed two fires in Xu Qing's perception. In fact, his speed was not enough to dodge the large hand. Only the power of three fires could do it!Xu Qing's eyes narrowed and battle intent flickered in them. The veins on his forehead bulged as he waved his hands fiercely. Immediately, a cry rang out in all directions from behind him and black flames surged into the sky. The Golden Crow inside danced out and circled Xu Qing before roaring at the sky, suddenly overlapping with Xu Qing.The Golden Crow's body overlapped with Xu Qing's body, covering the purple Daoist robe. It seemed to have transformed into an emperor's robe formed by feathers. Although this emperor's robe was a little illusory, it still emitted a noble aura.The Golden Crow's head transformed into a crown and floated above Xu Qing's head, brewing the aura of a supreme being.There was also the Golden Crow's phoenix tail, which became streamers on Xu Qing's body. The black sea of fire emitted by the phoenix tail transformed into a cloak behind him.From afar, the current Xu Qing, coupled with his handsome face, looked like a young emperor.In fact, he even had a faint resemblance to the Golden Crow Emperor he had seen in the dragon carriage.Even the captain was shocked by this scene. Xu Qing was expressionless and his gaze was dignified. He clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out at the huge palm above!This punch fused with the power from his life lantern and life fire. It used his battle intent and ferocity and also fused with the violent body of Golden Crow Refines All Life art. This punch was currently his most powerful attack.The world trembled and rumbling sounds rang out in all directions. This fist formed a phantom which grew larger and larger. Finally, it was on par with the large hand, and also emitted a domineering aura!However, Xu Qing's domineeringness was the disdain of an emperor, while the captain's domineeringness was the madness of the wilderness.When they collided, the sound resulting from the collision was deafening. An astonishing impact exploded where the fist and palm collided.Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood and his body rolled back. He couldn't maintain the emperor body formed by Golden Crow Refines All Life. His right fist was in intense pain and his arm was dislocated.The captain also spat out a mouthful of blood and his body lost control as he was thrown back. The rhombus-shaped rune in his eyes flickered a few times and dimmed. His right hand also felt intense pain and his wrist fractured.While being forced back, Xu Qing pressed down on his right arm, ruthlessly pushing it up. With a clicking sound, the dislocated part returned to its original position.The captain waved his left hand and a golden light flashed. His fractured wrist was frozen by the golden light and healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. He endured the pain and spoke calmly without revealing anything on his face."Kid, you're not bad. You're already comparable to 10% of my strength. Continue to work hard. Also... you lost." As he spoke, the captain looked at the surface of the sea.At that moment, on the surface of the sea, the sea snake that the two of them had bet on was grabbed by a tentacle that suddenly stretched out from the void and dragged out of the sea.The captain's expression was filled with smugness. He looked at Xu Qing and was about to say something when a strange glint appeared in the snake's eyes. It suddenly opened its mouth and bit at its own neck.The bite force was so great that not only did it use its full strength, but it also exhausted its potential. With a cracking sound, it bit through its neck but the snake wasn't dead. The strange glint in its eyes grew even stronger and it actually began to eat its body.The flesh swallowed by the snake's mouth spilled out from its broken body. It was a shocking and terrifying sight.The captain was stunned. Xu Qing calmly spoke."Captain, I won."After saying that, the snake head trembled as though it had lost some support and fell into the sea. As for Xu Qing's shadow, it silently returned.At the same time, the Diamond Sect's ancestor finally broke the seal.After he returned, he locked onto the captain in anger and embarrassment. He felt that he had embarrassed himself just now and was worried that this matter would make Demon Xu think that he was trash.This was especially so since the shadow had clearly made a great contribution this time.The captain stared blankly at the half of the sea snake that had landed on the surface of the sea before looking at Xu Qing. His expression was a little awkward as he spoke in a low voice."Junior Brother, let's discuss...""You lost.""Eh, your spirit ticket seems to have dropped again.""You lost.""I know, but I suddenly have a better idea. I think...""You, lost!" Xu Qing's expression was serious as he spoke word by word.After saying that, he thought about it and put on a surprised expression. It was as though the captain's lack of cooperation made him feel that it was a little unbelievable. After all, he had to admit defeat after losing a bet. This was as natural as repaying a debt.The captain's breathing was hurried and his eyes were a little red. After a long time, he gritted his teeth fiercely."Isn't it just pretending to be the third princess? What's the big deal? Just you wait!" The captain's eyes revealed determination as he turned and headed to the cabin of the ship.Xu Qing waited with intense anticipation. He also landed on the ship and looked at the door of the cabin.Time slowly passed. An hour later, when Xu Qing was feeling a little impatient, the door of the cabin slowly opened. A charming and graceful figure walked out with large strides.It was the third princess.At the start, the third princess' footsteps were still calm. However, after she completely walked out, her delicate face glanced at Xu Qing bitterly as she saw the strange expression on Xu Qing's face.The third princess suppressed her frustration and walked over with a cold snort. She lifted her skirt, revealing two thick thighs. After squatting at the side, she took out a large apple and took a big bite."That's enough!"The captain's disguise could be considered perfect and he looked extremely pretty. No matter how Xu Qing looked at him, he couldn't see anything wrong. The only thing was the captain's legs had a lot of hair.However, that small face with bright eyes and white teeth, as well as her slender jade-like hands, were imitated to perfection. Even the female disciples in the sect would be envious if they saw the captain now.This intrigued Xu Qing and he was somewhat curious about how the captain did it. After being sized up for a long time, the captain felt a little annoyed and embarrassed. He stretched out his soft hand to Xu Qing."Give me the storage bag."Xu Qing had taken away the third princess' storage bag earlier. He took it out and poured the items on the ground. Immediately, a large number of items fell out and piled up like a small mountain.Most of them were clothes. As for the spirit stones, there weren't many but there were some black stones that emitted dense anomalous substances. Xu Qing also saw many crystal bottles the size of a finger.Each of them had a black pearl with runes. It was the item that the third princess had thrown and had blasted his magic ship's outer shell."So many?" Xu Qing took one out and checked it before looking at the captain."This item is called Candle Yin Lightning. It's a one-time-use magic artifact unique to the Sea Corpse Race and is rarely seen in other territories because only experts of Sea Corpse Race can refine it. Its value depends on its strength." The captain rummaged through the items as he spoke."The might of the Candle Yin Lightning refined by different Sea Corpse Race members is different. There was once a Candle Yin Lightning refined by the Sea Corpse Race's ancestor that was comparable to a Nascent Soul attack. A few years ago, it was auctioned in Purple Earth and sold at a high price. This lightning is strange. Its might can increase after nurturing it with blood, and it is more lethal to people whose blood were used to nurture it."As he spoke, the captain took out some tokens and spoke proudly."I paid a huge amount to buy this profound disguise technique. Not only can it copy the target race's aura, but it can also perfectly imitate the target's energy fluctuations. I've been eyeing this third princess for a long time and have understood her completely.""Next, we'll head to the Sea Corpse Race. As long as we aren't trapped there for a long time or encounter a Golden Core expert who is going all out to investigate, we won't be exposed at all."As he spoke, the captain glanced at Xu Qing and took out a white robe, tossing it over. At the same time, he also handed him a small bottle."Put it on. Open the small bottle and place it on your body. Corpse poison will spread out from it. It can hide your aura and form some changes to your appearance."Xu Qing wore the robe and opened the bottle before putting it in his pocket. His aura instantly changed and he faintly emitted corpse poison. His appearance also became withered. He looked no different from the Sea Corpse Race in terms of aura and appearance.Xu Qing knew that this small bottle that caused such changes to his body couldn't be made by ordinary cultivators. This allowed him to have a certain understanding of the captain's various unorthodox methods."You will be my Dao Protector and escort me back to the Sea Corpse Race. We have to get into character from now on. We can't reveal any flaws. Do you agree?" The captain said solemnly.Xu Qing nodded. He felt that what the captain said made sense.Seeing Xu Qing nod, the captain coughed and stretched, revealing his graceful waist. After that, he elegantly sat at the side and stretched out his long-haired leg. As he ate the apple, he swayed his leg and spoke lazily."Come, Little Qing, massage my legs." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Xu Qing glanced at the captain and took out some poison powder from his storage bag, and was about to put them in his hands.The captain instantly retracted his leg and looked at Xu Qing with a solemn expression."I suddenly remembered that we should discuss the plan."

Chapter 259 Strange News In The Sea Corpse (1)
In the sky, a black wooden ship was whistling forward, breaking through the clouds at an extremely fast speed. The air was torn apart, creating loud sounds.Its target was the island of the Sea Corpse Race that was ten days away from here.Through the nautical chart distributed during the Seven Blood Eyes War, Xu Qing knew that although that place was an island, its size actually far surpassed that of the islands of the merfolk race. Its size was about 10% of the Nanhuang Continent.On this black wooden ship, Xu Qing and the captain finally decided on a plan for this trip after many discussions."We'll be able to reach the Sea Corpse Race in ten days. Your plan is good, but it won't be a problem to carry it out in a few days. Why do I feel that you are quite eager?"On the black wooden ship, the captain looked at Xu Qing and asked suspiciously.The two of them had discussed the plan to infiltrate the Sea Corpse Race for a day. The reason why it took so long was because the captain actually didn't have a plan. His plan was to adapt to the situation after infiltrating the island.Xu Qing didn't agree to such a plan.Hence, after some thought, he proposed a target: How could they enter the location of an ancestral corpse statue in the fastest way?With this target, the plan became simple. The fastest way was to be personally escorted by the cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race as soon as they entered the island.This way, they wouldn't waste any time.Xu Qing and the captain had already discussed how to accomplish this. That was to be injured!The third princess was heavily injured and barely managed to escape. Hence, the first thing she did was to recuperate. Her identity also determined that she would definitely be sent to the location of an ancestral corpse statue.After all, according to the information bought by the captain, other than being able to transform the dead into their race, the ancestral corpse statues also possessed astonishing healing effects.Hence, the captain's words of doubt from before."If an injury is formed just recently, outsiders will see through it at a glance. This won't be good."Xu Qing shook his head. After glancing at the captain, he spoke again."I'll add some every day and in ten days, the new and old injuries combined will make the situation look more real!"The captain's suspicions didn't diminish. He looked at Xu Qing, wanting to infer something from his face. He wondered if Xu Qing was using this to take revenge.Xu Qing looked into the captain's eyes without dodging.Looking at Xu Qing's gaze, the captain sighed. He recalled that he had taught Xu Qing this method, and now, even he couldn't tell if the latter was lying or not.However, he was a decisive person. He took out a dagger and stabbed himself in the stomach; blue blood flowed out and soaked his robe."It's just a small thing. What's the big deal?" The captain said nonchalantly and even took a bite of the apple.Xu Qing shook his head."Captain, self-inflicted wounds are different from injuries caused by others. For our plan, you will have to suffer a bit. Let me help you with this."The captain stopped chewing on the apple and glared at Xu Qing.Xu Qing looked into the captain's eyes seriously. After a moment of silence, the captain sighed and threw the dagger in his hand over, opening his arms wide."Come." n,0,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  Xu Qing smiled slightly. After he walked closer with the dagger, he stabbed the captain's stomach. After that, he pulled it out and stabbed again. He felt an indescribable comfort as he did this.The captain's breathing was hurried as he endured the pain. Xu Qing pulled the dagger out and stabbed the captain's thigh. He then slammed the captain's chest with the power of Sea Transformation Art.The captain spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale. Xu Qing didn't stop and continued to slash rapidly. Very soon, the captain's entire body was covered in blood. He looked extremely miserable and weak."Enough, enough, Xu Qing!!"Xu Qing stopped with some regret. His heart felt very relieved after slashing the captain. After he stopped, he looked at the captain's left leg and wondered if he should cut there tomorrow.Seeing that Xu Qing's gaze had landed on his leg, the captain's eyelids twitched. He looked Xu Qing up and down and suddenly spoke."Deputy Xu, as a Dao Protector, your protectee, the princess, is injured so badly, but you're actually fine. This doesn't make sense."Xu Qing's smile froze."So, in order to complete our great plan, you will also have to suffer a bit. It's fine, I'll help you." The captain's lips curled into a smile that was not a smile. His heart was filled with anticipation as he took the dagger back from Xu Qing and stabbed it fiercely into Xu Qing's thigh.Xu Qing wanted to dodge but he had to admit that what the captain said made sense. Hence, he took a deep breath and endured. He lifted his head and glanced at the captain, allowing the captain's blade to stab into his thigh.Xu Qing gritted his teeth fiercely.The captain leaped up excitedly and quickly stabbed him three times in the stomach. There was also a bloodstain on his neck and there were marks near many important organs on his body.Seeing that his flesh was badly mangled, Xu Qing suddenly took a step back and stared at the captain as he spoke hoarsely."Your right leg has many injuries but your left leg doesn't. This doesn't make sense." As he spoke, Xu Qing waved his hand and a dagger appeared, piercing into the captain's left leg. The captain bared his teeth and stabbed Xu Qing again. Just like that, the two of them attacked each other... After a long time, they both stopped and panted as they leaned against the handrail. They both looked to be severely injured."Xu Qing... I don't think there's a need to be so injured every day. We have to escape when we're being chased, right?" the captain said weakly.

Chapter 260 Strange News In The Sea Corpse (2)
"That's right. We can escape for seven to eight days before we are caught again." Xu Qing nodded in agreement. He thought about it and asked."Also, after we enter the Sea Corpse Race's territory, once we're discovered by them and our identities are exposed, what plan do you have to escape?"When the captain heard this, he raised his brows and took out the half-eaten apple. He took a big bite and smiled proudly."Vice Captain Xu, regarding this problem, I have a plan to escape but you don't have to worry too much. When you risk your life, it needs to be a little stimulating to be satisfying, so take good care of yourself.""However, seeing that you're my subordinate, it's not like I can't tell you. However, this is my greatest secret. En, it's worth a million spirit stones!"Xu Qing cast a deep glance at the captain. The despicable expression on the other party's face caused Xu Qing to dispel the thought of selling him a disorder teleportation talisman. He felt that there was no need.The captain was surprised when he saw Xu Qing keep silent. He glanced at Xu Qing and felt that Xu Qing should have some means to escape. However, he felt that no matter what method the latter used, it wouldn't be as powerful as his.'When the time comes and he needs my help, I'll obtain a million spirit stones.'At the thought of this, the captain felt comfortable.Just like that, time flowed by and very soon, seven days passed. The ship was only three days away from the Sea Corpse Race's territory.Other than meditating on the ship, Xu Qing and the captain would communicate with each other. The captain wanted Xu Qing to be more natural, so he would tell him some things about the Sea Corpse Race."We're almost done talking about the Sea Corpse Race. Let me tell you about this third princess. This girl is also a pitiful person. In reality, she hates the Sea Corpse Race even more than the Seven Blood Eyes. That's why I told you earlier that she would help us."The captain looked at his storage bag. Inside was the third princess of the Sea Corpse Race."This third princess was born in the human race. Her father's aptitude was astonishing. Back then, he was known as a heaven's chosen who had a chance of walking the path of the ancient kings and sovereigns.""However, he betrayed the race and voluntarily transformed into a Sea Corpse. After he transformed into a sea corpse, his cultivation rose rapidly. He was personally appointed as the Sea Corpse King of this generation by the Sea Corpse Race's ancestor.""This king of the Sea Corpse Race cultivates a special cultivation art of the Sea Corpse Race. It's called the Supreme Emotion Severing Art. He even cultivated it to the extreme and comprehended a domain called… Forgotten Sorrow!"It's obvious that everything was planned and prepared. Back then, when he betrayed his race, he took his wife and three daughters away and sealed them in the Sea Corpse Race territory, turning them into Dao Severing Spirits.""To put it simply, every time that king of the Sea Corpse Race severed his kin, it would cause his cultivation to break through a bottleneck. He killed his wife, eldest daughter, and second daughter many years ago in front of his youngest daughter, the third highness. The reason why she isn't dead is because that king hasn't reached another bottleneck.""This is also why I dragged her along. This girl looks silly but this was what she learned to protect herself since young. In fact, her hatred for her father has long reached an extreme and is much denser than our Seven Blood Eyes' hatred toward the Sea Corpse Race.""So, she has always liked to cause trouble. She just wants to seek death and be temporarily released. I reminded her not to cause trouble this time but it was still useless. This girl's desire to die has already seeped deep into her soul.""Actually, according to the information I bought, she has died seven to eight times over the years.""Unfortunately, half of her soul was extracted by her father and stored by his side. She can be recreated at any time, so even if she dies outside, it isn't a big issue."Xu Qing's expression changed as he continued to listen to the captain."There's a sentence in the information I bought. It was once said by this king of the Sea Corpse Race. Listen well.""The mortal world has smudged the painting, the brush cannot draw off the fleeting years, and a sense of loneliness is left behind; how can the sorrow be forgotten?"These words echoed on the ship and an indescribable sadness spread in all directions.Xu Qing remained silent.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 In this world under the god's fragmented face, everyone had their own stories, and most of them were tragic.This action of killing one's relatives to attain the Dao seemed tragic but it was nothing considering what Xu Qing had seen since he was young. However, he still took out a healing medicinal pill and threw it to the captain.The captain was stunned and spoke in surprise."What are you doing? Are you saying that my injuries are serious and want me to use it to recover?""This is for the third princess," Xu Qing calmly said."Little Qing, so there are times when you can be gentle." The captain looked at Xu Qing with a spurious smile and sized the medicinal pill in his hand."Have you taken a fancy to the third princess? Are you really prepared to be her boy toy?"Xu Qing expressionlessly looked at the captain's despicable expression without speaking."Little Qing, are you looking at me or your beloved third princess? Aiya, if those female disciples in the sect find out, they'll probably cry."The more the captain spoke, the happier he became. He put away the medicinal pill and took out a tangerine, peeling it and eating it.Seeing that Xu Qing was starting to frown, he wanted to continue but was interrupted by Xu Qing."Princess, we'll reach the Sea Corpse Race in three days. Some of your injuries are going to appear again."The captain's words were stuck in his throat as Xu Qing walked toward him. He took out a dagger and stabbed the captain's stomach. The captain gritted his teeth and took a deep breath. He also took out a dagger and glared at Xu Qing.
