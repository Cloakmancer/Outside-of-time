The blue insect had a malevolent appearance. Its mouthpart was very long, had four pairs of legs, and there were even natural patterns on its back that looked like ghost faces. Moreover, each ghost face was different. Some looked like they were crying, some looked like they were laughing, and some looked like they were angry.Although it was only the size of a palm, it was covered in sharp spikes. This was especially so for its tail, which actually had a mouth.The tiny teeth in the mouth were incomparably sharp.At this moment, although the corpses had dried up, when one swept their gaze over, they would still be shocked by the malevolent appearance of the insect."Ghost Desire!" Xu Qing's expression changed slightly. He quickly walked forward and observed the corpses carefully. Back then, he had heard Grandmaster Bai talk about this Ghost Desire. It only existed in the deep sea and was rarely seen on the market. It was considered a very obscure venomous insect.Its blood was blue in color and extremely poisonous. However, with some special concoctions, it could be made into a holy medicine that could heal injuries.Zhou Qingpeng, who was checking the medicinal pills in the shop, also took a glance when he heard this."As expected, you do recognize it." The shopkeeper smiled. At the same time, his opinion of Xu Qing grew even more. He was very clear that even the disciples of the Second Peak did not know many of these obscure venomous arthropods.Hence, he became even more curious. Where did this handsome youth in front of him learn such extraordinary medical knowledge?"How much are you selling it for?" Xu Qing was tempted and asked the shopkeeper."I don't dare to sell it." The shopkeeper coughed and kept the bag. When he saw that Xu Qing's gaze was still on the leather bag containing the venomous bug, he smiled and explained. "My boss had someone spend a lot of effort to get this. It was only delivered today. My boss will come and collect it in a while. How would I dare to sell it… I only took it out for you to admire. After all, this thing is a rare item."Xu Qing retracted his gaze with some regret. He didn't take out the white pills immediately but waited for a while until Zhou Qingpeng paid the bill and left. Only then did Xu Qing take out the leather bag that contained the white pills and place it on the counter."I'm not buying herbs today. I'm selling pills.""Hmm?" The shopkeeper's eyes narrowed. He immediately opened the leather bag and swept his gaze across it. His expression instantly changed."So many white pills?" He didn't inspect them immediately but washed his hands carefully at the side. After that, he put on a pair of gloves and signaled to Xu Qing that the gloves were dust-free. He then opened the leather bag and took out the white pills inside.As he placed them on the counter, his eyes revealed a hint of surprise. There were simply too many white pills. There were over 500 pills, and each of them was almost perfectly round. The medicinal fragrance gushed forth and permeated the entire medicinal shop.Many of the customers smelled the scent and looked over. Xu Qing frowned slightly, and his right hand naturally landed beside the leather bag containing the black iron stick.At this moment, the shopkeeper had finished examining the pills and was very surprised. He took a deep look at the youth in front of him. He originally thought that the other party's knowledge of flora and fauna was already excellent. However, he now knew that the other party's alchemy technique was even more outstanding.These medicinal pills were naturally formed, and it was obvious at a glance that they had been refined successfully on the first try. There were no mistakes in the refinement process. Moreover, every single one of them was white and translucent, and they also contained some natural medicinal oil, like mutton fat.Not everyone in the Second Peak's disciples possessed such skill. Hence, after taking inventory, the shopkeeper pondered for a moment before giving a price."How about ten spirit stones?"Xu Qing was aware of the prices in the main city. White pills were usually sold for around 30 spirit coins, and the value of a spirit stone was around 1,000 spirit coins.Hence, after some thought, he nodded in agreement.The shopkeeper hurriedly took out spirit stones and passed them to Xu Qing. After that, he put away the medicinal pills on the counter. Xu Qing swept his gaze across the crowd before turning to leave.When he reached the entrance, he saw a young girl walking over from the outside. Before she got close, the medicinal fragrance assaulted his senses first.This young girl looked to be about seventeen or eighteen years old. She held a white umbrella and wore a light orange Daoist robe!One had to know that in the entire Seven Blood Eyes, the piedmont disciples wore gray Daoist robes. Only core disciples could wear colored robes.For example, the light purple color of the Seventh Peak.These Daoist robes represented noble status!Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he dodged to the side and swept his gaze over. Under the white paper umbrella, the young girl's jet-black mid-length hair casually draped over her shoulders. A slanted fringe just happened to brush past her eyelids.Under her long eyelashes was a pair of glistening eyes. Her light orange Daoist robe seemed to have become a long skirt on her body.Her waist was slender, and her face was flawless, as though she did not belong to the mortal world. please visit n0ve1bin)(.)n(e)t  This was especially so when the rain and wind blew over at this moment, causing the two strands of hair by her cheeks to flutter gently in the wind, revealing her skin that was as fine and smooth as jade.She also saw Xu Qing. After her gaze swept past his face, she didn't have the arrogance of a core disciple. Instead, she smiled elegantly and let him pass first.Xu Qing nodded and retracted his gaze before he left. After he left, the fragrance of the young girl who had entered the medicinal shop quietly spread out in the entire shop, slowly spreading to the hearts of everyone."Boss, you're here. Actually, there's no need for you to come personally. I would have sent it over." The shopkeeper hurriedly ran over with a respectful expression."Uncle Peng, you don't have to be so polite. I'm tired from refining pills in the mountains, so I came out to relax." The girl smiled and followed the shopkeeper to the counter."It is my duty." The shopkeeper was as respectful as ever. He quickly followed and took out the leather bag containing the Ghost Desires from the counter, handing it to the young girl.Seeing that the shopkeeper was still so polite, the young girl helplessly shook her head. She was about to leave when her gaze suddenly swept over and landed on the white pills that had yet to be completely put away.She exclaimed softly.She lifted her jade-like white right hand and gently picked up a pill. She held it in front of her pure and flawless face and looked at it carefully. A hint of surprise appeared in her eyes."Boss, is there anything wrong with this pill?" When the shopkeeper saw her expression, he asked cautiously."There's no problem." The girl sniffed it."This pill is very good and its purity is extremely high. Such a pill is rarely seen."When the shopkeeper heard this, he was even more surprised."Boss, you're a core disciple of the Second Peak and a heaven's chosen in alchemy. Even you think the purity of this pill is rare? But no matter how high the purity of a white pill is, it's still a white pill."The girl chuckled."Uncle Peng, you're right. White pill is only a basic pill. Although the higher the purity, the better, you can just eat a few more for the same effect.""However, purity represents the refinement method. That is what I'm interested in." The young girl sized up the pill in her hand again.She got the shopkeeper to take out all the white pills in this batch. After checking them one by one, the surprise in her eyes grew increasingly intense."To think that every pill is of the same quality. There are so many of them, and judging from the temperature of the pills, they were refined in batches. The earliest they were refined should be yesterday.""This means the refiner already refined them to the extreme at the medicinal liquid stage. Every pill is exactly the same." The young girl muttered and got the shopkeeper to store all the white pills in this batch. She was going to take them back and study them carefully.Before she left, she thought of something and asked."Uncle Peng, where did you get this batch of white pills?""A disciple from an unknown peak. He just left. Boss, you should have seen him when you came in." After the shopkeeper finished speaking, he looked outside the medicinal shop. Xu Qing's figure was long gone.The young girl recalled for a moment, and the image of the handsome youth from earlier appeared in her mind. she nodded."Uncle Peng, if that person comes to sell pills again, please keep them for me."The shopkeeper hurriedly agreed while being shocked inwardly. At the same time, he became even more curious about Xu Qing.

Chapter 102 Pervert (1)
At this moment, Xu Qing, who had left the medicinal shop, was walking toward Port 79.Although the job of the Homicide Department required him to report for duty every day and occasionally head out to assist in patrolling, in reality, he was mostly free when there were no missions. Hence, Xu Qing planned to return to his berth and continue cultivating.He habitually walked along the edges of the path, trying his best to blend into the darkness as he moved forward silently.Due to the storm, many cargo ships and the boats of the sect's disciples couldn't enter the harbor in time, and were trapped in the sea.The storm ended today. Although it was still raining, there were still many boats entering the harbor.Xu Qing walked at the harbor, pondering over his alchemy and cultivation."The cost of refining one white pill is about three spirit coins. This is a long term business that will net me huge profits as time goes by." Xu Qing touched the spirit stones he had gotten for the white pills."The expenditure of cultivation is too great. If I want to maintain my previous speed, I'll need one pill every day. Also, it is almost time to pay the fee for the berth.""The refinement of the magic boat will cost even more." Xu Qing sighed in his heart. He somewhat regretted that he had been too decisive in his killing earlier and missed the opportunity to obtain the other party's items and contribution points.He started to ponder over the idea of capturing more wanted criminals or making a trip to the forbidden zone. Otherwise, if this continued, he would be lacking in resources if he wanted to upgrade his magic boat.In the entire main city, the prices of goods were very high, but cultivation resources were still the most expensive. The commoners could accept the prices of the former, but for the latter, forget about not having the qualifications to purchase them, even the disciples who had the qualifications to purchase them could rarely purchase them wantonly.To the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples, the expenditure of 30 spirit coins per day wasn't much. What really made them secretly kill and plunder each other was the cultivation resources of their target.If they wanted to advance, they could either accept missions and head out to complete them, or they could secretly kill and plunder. There was no other choice.On this point, only those core disciples with the core disciple token and the qualifications to reside on the mountain, but did not have the right to obtain a share of the benefits from the sect, would be in a much better situation.Xu Qing had heard many things about the Seven Blood Eyes over this period of time. He also understood that the so-called core disciples were those who had entered the sect with the tokens of the various peaks.For example, the Seventh Peak had purple tokens.As long as one held such a token, they would be able to stay on the mountain after entering the sect. Their robes were all light-colored, like the light purple-robed youth on the streets back then, or the light orange-robed girl from before.They were usually the juniors of the higher-ups of the various peaks. When they purchased any item, they only needed to pay 50% of what piedmont disciples had to pay. However, the sect restricted them from reselling the items for profit. If they were caught doing so, their identities would be revoked, so they rarely took the risk.The difference between the core disciples and the piedmont disciples was unfair, but this was the fate of humans. As for the dark-colored robes, only Foundation Building and above cultivators could possess them. They had already surpassed the core disciples and possessed the right to obtain the distribution of benefits from the Seven Blood Eyes."I have to think of a way to earn money as soon as possible..." As Xu Qing mused, a commotion rang out in the distance, interrupting his thoughts.Xu Qing looked at the source of the commotion. From afar, he saw many disciples gathered on the shore, seemingly waiting for something.Even the Seventh Peak's disciples on the magic boats at the harbor moved out one after another.In fact, behind him, whistling sounds could be heard as at least a hundred Seventh Peak disciples quickly gathered from all directions. All of their expressions were filled with eagerness as they gazed at the harbor in the distance.Xu Qing was bewildered. Hence, he also looked toward the harbor. Not long later, a gigantic ship slowly appeared at the end of his vision.This ship was at least 1,700 to 1,800 feet long. It was completely golden and extremely luxurious. Under the setting sun, it shone with a gorgeous light. At the bow of the ship was a huge statue of a human-faced spider.The human face only had one eye socket which seemed to be embedded with gems. It was extremely showy.From afar, the boat looked like a giant beast that was breaking through the sea.There was an even more luxurious pavilion built on the large ship. Among the carved railings and steps, one could see a large number of guards.At this moment, the humming sound echoed as the ship got closer and closer to the port."Third highness.""Third highness is back!"The crowd instantly broke into an uproar."Third highness?" Xu Qing curiously looked at the incomparably luxurious ship that was slowly entering the harbor. As it got closer, the fishy smell of the sea permeated the surroundings.An even more intense pressure spread out from the ship, shocking one's mind.After Xu Qing sensed it, his eyes narrowed.The might of this pressure gave him a sense of extreme danger. It was like those terrifying existences he had encountered in the depths of the forbidden zone's jungle.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  This was especially so when he got closer. He could clearly see that other than the pavilions and guards on this luxurious ship, there were also many sharp spikes that flickered with cold light.Each of these sharp spikes was over ten feet long. There were complicated runes on them that revealed astonishing lethality.This ship was the most terrifying one Xu Qing had seen in the past few days.Just this ship alone made Xu Qing feel that he couldn't resist it. This allowed him to have a deeper understanding of the Seventh Peak's magic boats. As his heart trembled, respectful voices rose and fell in the surroundings. Xu Qing saw several people walking out of the pavilion on the majestic and imposing ship. The person in the lead was a tall and skinny youth in a purple Daoist robe!The purple robe he wore wasn't the light-colored one Xu Qing had seen in the past, but dark-colored!!When he saw the dark-colored purple robe worn by this youth, the identity represented by this scene caused Xu Qing's expression to turn solemn. He was clear that this youth's cultivation base was definitely at the Foundation Building realm.

Moreover, from the respectful looks from the surrounding people, it could be seen that this person's identity was not as simple as an ordinary Foundation Building cultivator.However, this youth's complexion was sallow, and there were thick dark circles under his eyes. His body was skinny, and he looked like he had been hollowed out by alcohol and sex. There was also a hint of lasciviousness in his eyes.He stood at the bow of the ship, wearing a white hat with the character '禁' embroidered on it.This character was very strange and emitted an indescribable pressure.The dark purple Daoist robe that caused countless people to go crazy was extremely large on him. When the wind blew past him, the robe would make a whooshing sound as though it would blow away with him.He seemed to know how weak he was, so when he walked out, he was enjoying the respect from the disciples on the shore while hugging two cloaked women as support.One of the women was holding a crystal bottle that contained various nourishing substances. She was feeding them to him one mouthful at a time.These two women weren't old, and their appearances were quite beautiful. Their green eyes revealed a seductive charm. As the sea breeze blew, their long hair fluttered in the wind, revealing their tall and curvy figures under their cloaks.Their large breasts, plump butt, and ridiculously thin waists coupled with their pure faces caused them to emit waves of primal urges.Their clothing style was very bold. Their hot curves and fair skin that looked extremely soft and delicate were revealed to all the disciples, causing them to subconsciously neglect the glands on their cheeks.They let the youth hold them. Amidst their shyness, laughter echoed."We pay our respects to the third highness!" The respectful voices on the shore grew even louder.Xu Qing stared at the youth on the ship. He felt that without the support of the two women, the youth would collapse. This made him feel very strange and incredulous.He looked at the two beautiful women again and his gaze narrowed slightly. He could sense danger from these two women, so his gaze quickly swept past them. He saw that other than the guards on the ship, there were many people in black robes.The faces of these people were the same as the two women. They had green eyes and glands on their cheeks. All of them gave off extraordinary cultivation fluctuations.Other than them, there was also a young man who was about the same age as Xu Qing. His clothes were very luxurious, and his green eyes contained a hint of coldness as he glanced at the shore.He also had glands on his cheeks.Xu Qing looked at these features. This was the second time he had seen creatures that were similar to humans but different. However, from the reactions of the other disciples in the surroundings, they didn't seem to be surprised. Clearly, this species of non-humans wasn't rare.He quickly retracted his gaze and stopped looking. Just as he was about to leave, the youth who was being supported by the two women laughed as the ship got closer. "Although we encountered a storm on our trip this time around, our harvest wasn't bad. Junior brothers and sisters, you will get a share."As soon as he finished speaking, a large number of followers on the ship immediately leaped up. With a wave of their hands, palm-sized scales flew toward everyone on the shore.One flew towards Xu Qing as well. When he saw the scale flying over, he raised his hand and caught it. The first thing he felt was that it was slippery and cold. After that, he squeezed it slightly but was unable to crush it. His eyes slightly narrowed. He realized that these scales should be very extraordinary. At the same time, he understood why so many people had gathered on the shore."If every day was like this, there would be no need to worry about money." Xu Qing looked at the scale. After he kept it, he thanked the third highness on the distant ship just like everyone else.Amidst the thanks, the large ship docked at its berth. The third highness first waved his hand at his fellow disciples on the shore, before slapping the butts of the two nonhuman race women heavily without worrying about others.The two women let out coquettish cries and the skinny third highness started laughing evilly.The disciples saw this scene and lowered their heads one after another. Not many dared to boldly fix their gazes on the two nonhuman race women in front of the third highness.Xu Qing originally felt that there was nothing much to see, but he noticed that the expressions of the nonhuman race young man behind the two women seemed to contain some disdain.The third highness continued to flirt with the women and his attention seemed to be completely on their figures, and he didn't notice the expression of the nonhuman race young man behind him."Little fairies, wait for me here. Don't leave the ship carelessly. Otherwise, if my master sees it, he'll scold me again… But I wonder if master has returned. How about this, I'll go take a look first. If he hasn't returned, I'll come and play with you guys tonight."The two women seemed to be very fond of the third highness. They smiled charmingly and continued to flirt. Shortly after, the third highness coughed and took the crystal bottle with nourishing substances before telling the guards on the ship.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  "Take everything down. Be careful when moving them."Following his order, a large number of followers and guards carried out large boxes from the cabin. They were all sealed, so no one could see what was inside."Be careful when you move them. Also, record the video for me. This is prepared for the Eldest Senior Brother who is in seclusion. He's a petty person. I won't let him try to extort me by saying that the item has been damaged."While laughing, the third highness cupped his fists at the surrounding disciples and walked down the ship in a majestic manner, heading in the direction of the Seventh Peak.As he left, the disciples on the shore retreated rapidly while being on guard against each other. An oppressive atmosphere permeated the air.

Chapter 104 Pervert (3)
Everyone who obtained the scales was extremely vigilant. Many malicious gazes were hidden among them, filled with greed.They obtained the item, but it was hard to say if they could keep it.Soon, as everyone spread out rapidly, many disciples were targeted. Some gazes swept at Xu Qing too, but perhaps because he had gained some fame after killing Qing Yunzi a few days ago, those gazes hesitated and didn't act rashly.Xu Qing coldly watched all of this and left this place. He then warily returned to his berth. After confirming that it was safe, he took out his magic boat.While staring at it, he thought of the third highness' gigantic ship.The difference between the two was too great. Xu Qing fell silent for a moment but didn't step onto the magic boat to cultivate. Instead, he kept the magic boat and turned to walk toward the shops opened by the Sixth Peak's disciples.He was prepared to refine his magic boat.,m After he found a shop, he took out the scale and the fish bone that Zhang San had given him, and paid the refining fee.The Sixth Peak's disciple who was going to refine it told him that it would be finished in the time it took an incense stick to burn.While waiting, Xu Qing looked at the various miscellaneous items displayed in the shop. Most of them were materials from living creatures, and each of them was extremely valuable.Among them, Xu Qing saw a piece of lizard skin and asked the staff at the side. He learned that it actually cost 150 spirit stones per piece."So expensive!" Although he was mentally prepared and knew that cultivation resources were expensive, Xu Qing was still surprised by the price."This is the shed skin of a fifth level Qi Condensation sea lizard. Such complete skin is hard to come by. It's quite strong." The shop assistant glanced at Xu Qing from the corner of his eyes and explained.Xu Qing silently retracted his gaze. After scanning through all the items, his gaze landed on a heart the size of a human head. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  This heart was contained in a crystal bottle and was still beating slowly. "This is the heart of a Dragon Beard Beast. Although it can't reach the level of powering Foundation Building realm magic boats, it's enough to act as the power source for normal magic boats."The staff explained, but Xu Qing didn't ask about the price. He knew very well that such a power source was usually exaggeratedly expensive.In short, the prices of all the biological materials were extremely ridiculous.Xu Qing sighed inwardly as he felt that his savings were insignificant. By the time he finished looking at the items, his spirit boat had been refined.When the shopkeeper passed the small bottle to him, Xu Qing immediately saw that the magic boat in the bottle was somewhat different from before. Not only was it larger, but there was also a scale-like totem on it.He infused his spirit energy into it and sensed it. He realized that not only was there a change in its outer appearance, but the sturdiness of the magic boat had also increased by a level. Xu Qing nodded in satisfaction and left after expressing his gratitude, heading straight for the harbor.He planned to test it.As Xu Qing neared the harbor and returned to his berth, he released the magic boat after confirming that the surroundings were safe.As the light shone, a boat with a length of 70 to 80 feet and a width of over 10 feet appeared in front of Xu Qing. The boat was densely covered with clear-looking scale totems.Compared to before, the current magic boat was even more savage, and the feeling of being a giant crocodile was even more intense. This was especially so for the crocodile-headed statue. The fish bone embedded in it formed gusts of wind that continued to circle it.One could imagine that once it erupted, its speed would be much faster than before.All of this caused Xu Qing's eyes to glow."If I have a large number of spirit stones and materials, what will my magic boat become?""I need to earn money!" Xu Qing mumbled.

Chapter 105 The Diligent Xu Qing (1)
Cultivation required resources.In particular, the arrival of the god's fragmented face caused all things to be invaded by anomalous substances. This made it extremely difficult to obtain resources, and the process was usually bloody.A look of contemplation appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. The number of spirit stones and materials he needed was extremely large, and the profits from selling white pills was far from enough."The Homicide Department gives three spirit stones a month. As for the white pills... if I work hard, I should be able to earn twenty spirit stones a month. If I calculate it this way, I'll earn twenty-three spirit stones a month."Xu Qing frowned.Right now, if he wanted to maintain his cultivation speed, he would have to consume one spirit stone every day. When he thought about the refining materials he had seen in the Sixth Peak's disciple's shop, even the cheapest item cost tens of spirit stones."The renting of a berth costs 30 spirit stones a month. In that case, I'll have to earn at least 60 spirit stones a month to barely maintain my cultivation. If I want to refine the magic boat, the demand will be even greater." Xu Qing opened his storage bag to take a look.He still had 20 spirit stones in his storage bag. This was the reward he had received from the Homicide Department after killing Qing Yunzi."If I want to obtain more spirit stones, there are three ways. One is to hunt in the forbidden zone, the other is to kill wanted criminals, and the last is to head out to sea to gather the materials. n(ovelbin[.]nEt Xu Qing thought about it. The first method needed him to make a trip to the First Peak. This was because one had to obtain a travel permit from the First Peak to enter the forbidden zone next to the sect. In addition, disciples from other peaks would have to pay a certain fee to enter.As for the third method, hunting at sea was naturally the most suitable. However, besides the cultivation requirement, there was also a requirement for the magic boat. If it didn't have a certain level of strength, it might be destroyed.Xu Qing felt that his cultivation was okay, but the level of his magic boat was too low. Also, the magic boat needed spirit stones and materials to upgrade. This was an endless cycle."The fastest way is still to kill the wanted criminals or plunder other disciples. Like this, I can quickly increase the level of my magic boat and cultivation base. After that, I can head out to sea to hunt. This will allow everything to snowball and become unstoppable!"A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. Compared to plundering his fellow sect members who didn't provoke him, he felt that killing wanted criminals was more suitable.After making his decision, Xu Qing sat cross-legged in his level two magic boat and added a spirit stone to the spirit energy gathering array before he began his cultivation.However, not long after he started cultivating, Xu Qing opened his eyes and took out his identity token in confusion. A voice transmission message appeared on it."Junior Brother Xu Qing, I'm Zhou Qingpeng. Was it you I saw at the medical shop last time? You've changed so much. I thought about it for a long time before figuring out that it should be you. I see that you seem to be very interested in that Ghost Desire. I know this thing. My family is in the business of medicinal herbs. If you need it, I can get someone to help you get it. It's just that it will be a little expensive."After Xu Qing finished listening, he fell into deep thought. He could tell that Zhou Qingpeng wanted to earn some spirit stones from him, and he really wanted a Ghost Desire to study its poison. Hence, he agreed.Time flowed and very soon, six days passed.During these six days, when Xu Qing went to the Homicide Department to report for duty every day, he would pay attention to the wanted list. His informant also paid more attention to this aspect at his request. It was just that... there were quite a lot of people in the Homicide Department who used this method to earn money. Most of these types of information were kept secret. Hence, when there were occasionally some good tasks, Xu Qing would usually end up with nothing when he reached there.This forced Xu Qing to change his method.At the same time, after Xu Qing, a newbie came to the Homicide Department.However, this newbie clearly had a background and wasn't in the same division as Xu Qing. After he arrived, he did not become an ordinary member but was directly appointed as the captain of Team Three of the Earth Division.Moreover, this person seemed to have some tricks up his sleeves. He had only taken his post for less than two days, but the twenty or so team members under him were all obedient.However, because of different deputy directions, the four divisions of the Homicide Department usually acted independently and only worked together in large-scale missions. Sometimes, there would even be disputes.The other divisions knew that Team Three of the Earth Division had a new captain. Originally, they wouldn't have cared much, but the appointment of this newcomer caused some waves.This was because... the newly appointed captain of Team Three wasn't a human.Xu Qing had seen him once from afar and immediately recognized this new captain of Team Three of the Earth Division. He was none other than the nonhuman race youth who had returned with the third highness many days ago.That day, when the young man from the nonhuman race saw the third highness hugging the two girls from the same race, his gaze revealed disdain, and Xu Qing had noticed it.As for his identity, it was quickly dug out by the various people who were paying attention to the Homicide Department. Xu Qing had heard from the members of Team Six that the other party was a merfolk.Although the merfolk race was a nonhuman race, they were allies with Seven Blood Eyes and had many business dealings with each other. It was said that this person had a distinguished status in the merfolk race.After he was brought back by the third highness, he decided to join the Seven Blood Eyes, and came to the Homicide Department under the third highness' arrangement.,m As for the identity of the third highness, Xu Qing had his own guesses. He also asked the others to confirm his thoughts.The peak leader of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes had three personal disciples, two men and one woman.Every one of these three people was like the crown prince and eldest princess in the Seventh Peak. A single sentence from them could make countless disciples of the Seventh Peak lower their heads. In fact, it was the same in the entire Seven Blood Eyes.Also, because the Seventh Peak's peak lord himself had outstanding talent, his fame spread throughout the entire Nanhuang Continent. His battle prowess was monstrous, and his authority was the same. As his personal disciples, their rankings in the Seven Blood Eyes was extremely high.Among them, the eldest prince was in closed-door cultivation all year round to break through his bottleneck. It had been many years since anyone had seen him. However, Xu Qing heard from his teammates that this eldest prince was extremely mysterious and his combat strength was terrifying.

Chapter 106 The Diligent Xu Qing (2)
Back when he was in the Foundation Building realm, the first highness had killed many people of the same realm and slaughtered several small nonhuman races. In the entire Seven Blood Eyes, the first highness was ranked second among the personal disciples of the various peaks.During the discussion, the captain of Team Six, who was eating an apple, pointed out precisely."Generally speaking, such people aren't bloodthirsty. It's just that their personalities have their own extreme points. Once their reverse scale is touched, they naturally will carry out a massacre."When Xu Qing heard this, he deeply agreed.As for the Second Senior Sister, when her teammates mentioned her, all of them had a look of fear on their faces. Compared to the mysterious first highness that very few people had seen in the past few years, there were too many people who had seen the second highness.She would usually stroll around the harbor. Her personality was very domineering, and her actions were even more decisive. She was known for being overbearing in her actions, but she also had monstrous strength. Once she was enraged, even the elders of the Seventh Peak would have a headache."Hers is an illness. It needs to be treated," the captain said softly.Among the Peak Master's disciples, the most popular one would be the third highness.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Other than being lecherous, the third highness had almost no shortcomings. He usually had a smile on his face and didn't put on any airs when facing other disciples. Moreover, he was extremely generous.He did his best to resolve the requests for help from the disciples. This was especially so for their relationship with the nonhuman races on the sea. He had made a lot of contributions in this and many disciples even called him the diplomatic ambassador of the Seventh Peak.And his romantic affairs were also a hot topic among the disciples.The captain of Team Six took another bite of the apple and seemed like he wanted to comment as well. However, he seemed to have thought of something and ultimately didn't speak. He only continued to eat the apple and looked at everyone with a smile on his face.Although Xu Qing was seriously listening to his team members' discussion, he didn't pay too much attention to it. Regardless of whether it was the merfolk youth or the three highnesses of the Seventh Peak, none of them had anything to do with him.Xu Qing's main focus during this period of time was the wanted criminals. As for the method to find them, he made a change.He just needed to wait for the prey.On this night, Xu Qing was on duty.The night was dark and the wind was strong. The moonlight was sparse, and the sea breeze brought moisture to every corner of the city. It was as though they wanted to witness the various dark events that happened in the city during the night.The gambling dens and brothels were also bustling with activity. There was an endless stream of people coming and going, and from time to time, one could see figures in dark clothes walking on the roofs and walls of various buildings.Spirit energy fluctuations could be felt occasionally from the alleys. It was as though all sorts of demons and ghosts were slowly descending into the human world under the moonlight.p However, as a figure walked past, all the noise became lower.Only after the figure left did everything return to normal.This figure was none other than Xu Qing.Ever since he dragged Qing Yunzi's corpse across half of the city, it was like this every time he was on night duty.There were no secrets to speak of in the main city. To be able to capture Qing Yunzi, who was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, alive, even if the other party was only a Qi Condensation cultivator of a small sect, the fact that he couldn't escape and was in an incomparably miserable state still showcased Xu Qing's strength.Moreover, he was able to leave safely after confronting the shopkeeper outside the inn on Panquan Road. All of this was enough to show that this newbie from the Homicide Department could not be easily provoked. This was also one of the reasons why Xu Qing did not encounter other wanted criminals after that.However, it did not matter. Xu Qing felt that he had found a new solution. At this moment, he was walking in the darkness of the city and arrived at Panquan Road. He looked at the inn that was open not far away and stood motionlessly in a corner under the eaves.His body seemed to have fused with the night as he silently waited.Since he couldn't find any clues or wanted criminals, he might as well wait patiently.Xu Qing was fully equipped with patience. As for the possibility of offending the old man from the inn by waiting here, Xu Qing had considered it. However, spirit stones were more important. Moreover, Xu Qing felt that with his current combat strength, it wasn't impossible for him to fight.Just like that, time passed. Four hours later… before dawn, a figure silently sped over from afar. His target was none other than the inn.This person was a skinny middle-aged man. His eyes were small and his beard was very long, making his sharp chin look even stranger. He looked like a rat.At this moment, his small eyes were filled with vigilance. Seeing that he was getting closer and closer to the inn's entrance, his heart relaxed and he sighed with relief as he quickly moved toward the inn."The main city of the Seven Blood Eyes is truly wonderful, especially the inns that are open at night. They follow the rules and provide shelter. It's very perfect, but it's too damn expensive.""80 on the first day, 160 on the second day, double the amount every day… Looks like I'll have to go to a small city in a few days. It's a pity that the commoners in those small cities don't have any savings and can only cry out in pain," the skinny middle-aged man mumbled. He was only 20 feet away from the inn and was about to leap over.However, at this moment, a gust of cold wind suddenly blew behind him, and a cold voice entered his ears."Daoist Rat?"The skinny middle-aged man's eyes narrowed, and all the hairs on his body stood on end. Without any hesitation, he waved his right hand behind him, scattering some kind of powder. His body then erupted with power as he sped forward.However, it was still too late. The instant he lifted his right hand, a dagger appeared in front of his neck and ruthlessly sliced through it!As blood gushed out, the skinny middle-aged man's entire body trembled. His limbs twitched and he let out a series of whooshing sounds. However, he couldn't speak. He struggled to turn around and saw the expressionless Xu Qing behind him.That powder was useless against Xu Qing."Daoist Rat is from the Litu Sect. He specializes in bewitching medicines and has a twisted personality. He enjoys slaughtering mortals for fun. Half a year ago, he was wanted by Purple Earth for 15 spirit stones and the notice was spread throughout the Nanhuang Continent."Xu Qing didn't look at Daoist Rat, who had lost his breath. Instead, he recited the contents of the wanted jade slip while looking at the old man who was standing in front of the inn with a gloomy expression."There's no need to continue. I know he's a wanted criminal," said the old man gloomily.Xu Qing fell silent and cut off Daoist Rat's head. He then took his leather pouch and kicked the corpse.The corpse landed loudly at the entrance of the inn."He didn't enter the inn. I didn't break your rules. You don't have to pay for the corpse. It's a gift for you."With that, Xu Qing took a few steps back until he was a safe distance away. He then quickly left with Daoist Rat's head."I still lack 45 spirit stones for this month…"

Chapter 107 Gurgle Gurgle
Staring at Xu Qing's departing figure, the eyes of the old man in the inn gleamed with killing intent. However, even until Xu Qing disappeared from the streets, he didn't choose to act.In the silence, the killing intent in his eyes slowly faded.A huge python head hung down from the roof beam above and landed beside the old man. Its mouth emitted waves of gurgling sounds as though it was talking."Why didn't I kill him?" The old man rolled his eyes."This kid is a little strange. He gives me a very dangerous feeling. Unless I use my trump card…""Gurgle, gurgle.""You're trash, your entire family is trash! Eat, eat, eat, you only know how to f*cking eat. Alright, eat." The old man muttered. The python suddenly rushed out and bit Daoist Rat's corpse, swallowing it immediately before slowly returning to the beam.Xu Qing headed straight for the Homicide Department in the darkness. After he handed the head over with great familiarity, he received 15 spirit stones and arrived at a small breakfast shop owned by a commoner in the early morning.After drinking a bowl of warm soy milk and eating a few pancakes, under the enthusiastic recommendation of the shopkeeper, Xu Qing ordered three eggs extravagantly after some hesitation. He finished them all before cautiously returning to his berth and entering his magic boat.The harvest from this trip wasn't just the 15 spirit stones on the surface. In Daoist Rat's leather pouch, there was also a spirit stone and miscellaneous items. Xu Qing calculated according to the price at the port and discovered that he could sell them for two or three spirit stones."This method is still the most profitable." Xu Qing mumbled and began to cultivate.Very soon, a day passed. When night fell, Xu Qing opened his eyes. Today wasn't his night shift duty, but Xu Qing still walked out of the magic boat under the moonlight and headed toward Panquan Road.Since he could earn money by lying in wait, Xu Qing planned to do it more.Just like that, at midnight, Xu Qing's figure once again appeared on Panquan Road. After walking one round, he didn't stop at the place from yesterday. Instead, he changed his location and stared at the inn motionlessly.However, this time around, it didn't take long for a wanted criminal to arrive. However, Xu Qing managed to see the old man from the inn.The old man walked out of the inn and stopped ten feet away from Xu Qing. His expression was gloomy as he stared at Xu Qing."Kid, you keep provoking me. Do you really think I won't attack?""No," Xu Qing calmly replied."You…" Seeing Xu Qing act like this, the old man didn't know what to say. After a long time, he gritted his teeth and spoke."What exactly do you want to do? Wait here every day?"Xu Qing was silent. A few breaths later, he glanced at the old man and spoke in a deep voice."I want to earn money.""I want to earn money too!" The tentacles in the old man's eyes began to crawl out, and another crack appeared between his brows. A cold and gloomy aura spread out."If you continue like this, no one will dare to come to my inn. You have already affected my business." Amidst the pervading aura, the old man stared at Xu Qing and spoke word by word."Leave this place right now!"Xu Qing fell into deep thought. He felt that what the other party said made sense. If this continued, no one would dare to come to the inn. Hence, he nodded and left this location to head to the other side of the street.That place was even more hidden.The old man thought that Xu Qing was about to leave, but when he saw that the other party had actually changed to an even more concealed location, his veins bulged and he laughed out of extreme anger. He decided not to speak anymore and waved his hand, causing the space between his brows to completely split open. His head then split into two halves, tilting to the side.And at the location where his head originally was, a red light appeared. This red light emitted a bloody intent, and within it was a lump of bloody flesh that was filled with tentacles.It was a shocking sight. As those tentacles continued to extend, the old man walked toward Xu Qing with a malevolent expression.As waves of dangerous fluctuations spread out, the giant python in the inn also revealed its head. The ropes in the surroundings materialized out of thin air and hung down in many places on the streets, enveloping Xu Qing within.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and slowly spoke as he looked at the old man walking over."This place is on the streets and not your inn. I respect your rules and won't touch anything in the inn. However, if you tyrannically demand that I can't touch your guests after they leave, you're being too unreasonable.""Could it be that staying at your place also includes protection when going out?" Xu Qing looked at the old man. He felt that the other party could be reasoned with.The old man stopped in his tracks."So what if it is included!"Xu Qing fell silent and took out a bag of spirit coins from his leather pouch. There were more than 200 spirit coins in it, and he tossed them over.The old man was stunned."Since it includes outside protection too, I'll pay two days of rent. You can protect me now," Xu Qing said seriously.The old man held onto the bag of spirit coins and was in a daze for a long time before he looked at Xu Qing. After a while, he let out an aggrieved sigh. His head, which had been split into two, closed again, revealing a helpless expression. "Gurgle, gurgle…" In the inn not far away, the head of a python that was exposed emitted a sound."Shut up, I know what he said makes sense!" The old man glared at the python.He was indeed a reasonable person, and what Xu Qing said made sense. He couldn't find a place to refute.The other party indeed didn't break his rules and even gave him spirit coins. If he insisted on what he said earlier, then logically speaking, the other party was under his protection now… All of this caused the old man to feel a strong helplessness. He stood there and looked at Xu Qing. Xu Qing also looked at him.The two of them stared at each other. After a while, the old man sighed."I'll tell you clues about two wanted criminals. You can investigate the clues to capture them. Don't come to my place anymore."The old man took out a jade slip and imprinted some information before tossing it to Xu Qing. He didn't return the spirit coins and walked toward the inn without turning back.As he left, the ropes in the surroundings dissipated. The python in the inn lifted its head and nodded at Xu Qing from afar as though it was greeting him before disappearing as well.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Xu Qing glanced at the jade slip in his hand. There were two locations listed as well as the names of the wanted criminals. After he kept them, he lowered his head and kept the powder that was hard to detect on the walls around him. He then scattered some neutralizing agent on the ground to neutralize the poison.After that, he walked through the streets and headed to the place where he had hidden earlier. On the way, he kept waving his right hand lightly, neutralizing all the poisonous powder on the ground and in the air. After that, he did the same thing to the place he was originally at.Finally, he dug out seven to eight green plants at the side.Those green plants contained five types of poison.The change in his location earlier was something he had made preparations for. Regardless of his original location or the hidden corner on the other side of the street, he had arranged poison powder beforehand."To think that the poison did not immediately break out even after he was poisoned by thirty seven poisons…" After dealing with the poison, Xu Qing turned his head and looked at the inn. His eyes narrowed as he turned and left rapidly.After he left, the calm expression of the old man in the inn instantly vanished. As his breathing hastened, he immediately rummaged through the medicinal pills and swallowed over ten types of antidote pills. After that, he quickly performed a series of hand seals and burned the bag Xu Qing had given him.The spirit coins inside also dissipated under the flames."This brat is too sinister. He spread poison everywhere, and even the spirit coins he gave me were smeared with poison!" The old man gritted his teeth. In reality, the reason why he had compromised earlier was partly because Xu Qing's words made sense, and partly because… at that time, he was almost unable to control the poison that was about to break out.That was the main reason."At such a young age, his actions are already like this… When he grows up in the future, he'll be a living, breathing calamity of the human race." The old man panted as he mumbled."You like him?""He likes you too. Didn't you notice that when he saw you, the part he looked at was where your gallbladder was." The old man sneered.The gurgling stopped abruptly.The sky was still dark. Xu Qing sped through the streets at an extremely fast speed. Naturally, he wouldn't completely believe the locations given by the old man. Hence, after some thought, he took out his identity token and transmitted his voice. After that, he kept the token and pondered for a moment before continuing on his way.The first location was a little remote. After Xu Qing reached the location, he waited for a long time, observing very carefully. Finally, he confirmed that although there were people living here before, they didn't seem to have returned for a long time.Hence, he gave up and went to the second location.The second location was a gambling den. There were many people here, and all sorts of voices spread in all directions. Xu Qing observed from an empty house not far away.According to the old man's jade slip, a wanted criminal named Sun Dewang had come ashore recently and gambled here every day.This person was nonhuman. He was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation which was quite high. He was usually active on the Forbidden Sea and was involved in piracy. He was quite famous and the wanted poster on the jade slip stated that he belonged to an organization called Sea Ghost.This organization was one of the few active pirate forces on the Forbidden Sea.The bounty on Sun Dewang's head was extremely high, reaching 40 spirit stones. As for the source of the bounty, there were a lot of them. There were a total of over ten merchant ships that had added to the bounty.One could see how savage this person was at sea.Hence, Xu Qing didn't act rashly. He observed for more than an hour and watched the various gamblers entering and exiting. He listened to their conversations. Some were embarrassed, some were forthright, some were high-spirited, and some were bitter and at a loss.After confirming that there weren't too many spirit energy fluctuations in the vicinity, Xu Qing thought about it but didn't choose to enter to take a look. He continued to wait outside.Just like this, time slowly passed. Four hours later, when the sky was about to turn bright, Xu Qing finally found his target.It was a fat man in a brocade robe who looked like a landlord. He walked out of the casino, but after taking a few steps, he warily lifted his head. His gaze then landed on the place where Xu Qing was hiding. His eyes instantly narrowed, revealing a hint of danger."Today is truly a strange day. I've already f*cking lost the money I made a few days ago, and now, I've even met someone who wants to hunt me down. A mere seventh level of Qi Condensation dares to hunt others? Tired of living? I will use this chance to recover some of my losses!" As he spoke, the fatty strode forward and rushed toward where Xu Qing was.Dawn wasn't far away. A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he also rushed out.

Chapter 108 The Secret Worth 100 Spirit Stones (1)
In an instant, the two of them neared each other outside the gambling house. Xu Qing circulated the Sea Transformation Art and Mountains and Seas Art in his body at the same time. He was prepared to end the battle quickly, so he used his full strength and punched.Amidst the rumbling sounds, the fatty's body trembled and his expression clearly changed. Clearly, he had misjudged Xu Qing's strength earlier. At this moment, when he came into contact with Xu Qing, he immediately sensed the terrifying power coming from Xu Qing's body.He abruptly retreated. However, his speed was still slower compared to Xu Qing. In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing's fist landed on his stomach.The fatty's body shook, but he didn't retreat from the impact. Instead, he turned into a piece of skin like he had hollowed out his insides and moved toward Xu Qing.The fatty's skin was very large and wide, covering everything like an octopus. It was about to wrap around Xu Qing.Xu Qing frowned slightly. A large number of water droplets instantly appeared outside his body and rapidly transformed into rhombuses that shot out like arrows, piercing through the skin with popping sounds.A sinister figure crawled out of the tattered skin and retreated.It was a humanoid creature covered in mucus. Its hair was green, and its body was covered in scales. Its eyes revealed a ferocious glint, and a forked tongue protruded from its sharp fangs.It cast a deep glance at Xu Qing but didn't continue attacking. Instead, it tried to flee.Xu Qing coldly stared at it and waved his right hand. A water curtain appeared out of thin air and blocked the nonhuman nonhuman cultivator. This caused the nonhuman cultivator to have no choice but to step back a little, and the viciousness in its eyes grew even more intense. "You're courting death!"The nonhuman cultivator charged toward Xu Qing. It waved its hands and a large amount of black gas drifted out, forming resentful spirits that let out mournful cries as they pounced toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing's face was expressionless. The qi and blood in his body spread out, and an even more mournful cry rang out from the mouths of those resentful spirits. After the spirits were dispersed, Xu Qing took a step forward and arrived in front of the nonhuman cultivator whose expression had completely changed. He then grabbed forward.This nonhuman cultivator's breathing became hurried, and its eyes revealed madness.At this moment of crisis, all the scales on its body fell off at the same time and swept toward Xu Qing like a storm of sharp blades.After doing this, it actually didn't flee. Instead, it viciously stabbed toward Xu Qing's neck with its sharp fingernails."Die!"However, in the next instant, the nonhuman cultivator's eyes narrowed abruptly, revealing disbelief and horror.Xu Qing didn't care about his scale storm at all. No matter how the scales attacked, it couldn't stop his unstoppable palm. It directly penetrated the scale vortex and grabbed the nonhuman cultivator's hand.With a cracking sound, it was broken ruthlessly, causing it to twist exaggeratedly.His body took advantage of the momentum to move closer, and his forehead ruthlessly smashed into the head of the nonhuman cultivator. A blood-curdling screech rang out. The nonhuman cultivator wanted to retreat, but its hand was grabbed by Xu Qing. The feeling of being clamped by iron pincers caused its breathing to become hurried. It was extremely terrified but was unable to break free no matter what it did."Fellow Daoist, I am…"Before it could finish speaking, Xu Qing calmly twisted its hand again and forced its sharp fingers to pierce into its brow.The sound of bones and flesh breaking rang out. The nonhuman cultivator let out a cry of despair. Its voice was extremely miserable, and its eyes revealed intense fear.However, its body structure was different from humans, so this wasn't fatal to it.However, it was still heavily injured. As its blood continued to flow out, its aura rapidly weakened till it fainted. Xu Qing grabbed it by the neck and dragged it into the distance.The gambling den was completely silent. Regardless of the gamblers or guards, all of them were trembling at this moment. The sounds of Xu Qing and Sun Dewang fighting earlier were very loud and had attracted their attention. However, Xu Qing's attacks were too ruthless and the entire battle finished too quickly.This was especially so after they recognized the identity of the nonhuman cultivator outside. After realizing how powerful he was, they became even clearer about how terrifying Xu Qing was.No one dared to speak. Amidst the suffocating atmosphere, Xu Qing, who was about to walk away, suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked into the distance.On the empty and pitch-black street in the distance, a person walked over.As he got closer and stepped into the area illuminated by the lights outside the gambling house, his figure became clearer. A light purple Daoist robe gradually entered Xu Qing's vision.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The person in front was a youth with long black hair. He had an extraordinary appearance, a tall and slender figure. The arrogance in his walk and expression was obvious. In particular, his Daoist robe revealed his high status.There was also the eighth level Qi Condensation fluctuation of the Sea Transformation Art on his body, causing a large number of water droplets to form in the surroundings. Every single drop carried sharpness as they locked onto Xu Qing."Which division of the Homicide Department are you from? Let him go, and I can pretend I didn't see this!"The person's words were cold and unquestionable.Xu Qing fell silent. He had seen this youth before. Some time ago, when he was on his first patrol with his team captain, he had seen the scene of the youth walking among the crowd like a god that had descended to the mortal world.He knew very well that this person was a core disciple of the Seventh Peak.Xu Qing frowned slightly. Although he had made some arrangements previously to prevent any accidents, they would probably not be of much use against a core disciple. Xu Qing felt that it wasn't worth it to have a conflict with a core disciple for 40 spirit stones unless the benefits were greater.

Chapter 109 The Secret Worth 100 Spirit Stones (2)
However, at this moment, a cold voice rang out faintly from behind the light purple-robed youth."Wow, such an amazing core disciple, to directly interfere with law enforcement in front of us, the Homicide Department."As the voice rang out, the light purple-robed youth abruptly turned around. Xu Qing also looked toward the source and immediately saw a figure walking over unsteadily from afar. This figure was eating an apple as he walked. He was none other than the captain of Team Six.The eyes of the light purple-robed youth narrowed, and Xu Qing also showed a hint of surprise in his eyes. However, what surprised him wasn't the captain's arrival, but the fact that the captain actually chose to reveal himself at this moment.In reality, it was impossible for Xu Qing to completely believe the clues given by the old man from Panquan Road. In this Seven Blood Eyes main city where the human heart was dark and sinister, it was very likely that the other party had intentionally given him the clue that led to a deep pit.This was especially so for a business like the gambling den. Since it was able to start its business in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, it must have some background. Hence, on the way here, Xu Qing thought about it and sent a voice transmission to the captain, promising to give him half of the profits. The captain would step in when necessary to resolve an unexpected dispute.Regardless of whether this dispute would occur or not, he would still get his share of spirit stones.The clue to the first wanted criminal was outdated, so the captain didn't appear. Now that the second clue had drawn out a core disciple, Xu Qing originally thought that the captain wouldn't appear.Sensing the surprise on Xu Qing's face, the captain took a bite of the apple and winked at Xu Qing. After that, he looked at the light purple-robed youth whose expression was somewhat unsightly. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 "According to the third rule of the Homicide Department, those who obstruct the Homicide Department when they are carrying out law enforcement will be heavily punished.""He's a wanted criminal. We're enforcing the law. This is official business.""Are you trying to obstruct us?" The captain smiled at the light purple-robed youth.In Xu Qing's view, the captain was clearly wearing a gray Daoist robe, but the domineering tone of his voice and the unsightly expression of the light purple-robed youth made Xu Qing feel as though the two of them had changed identities.He was truly shocked.As for the light purple-robed youth, after hearing the captain's words, his breathing quickened slightly and his mind raced. In reality, Sun Dewang had given him a lot of presents. This casino was also one of his businesses, so he couldn't allow anyone to obstruct his benefits.However, the light purple-robed youth was a little wary of the captain of Team Six. He knew of this person and had heard of him before. From what he remembered, this person had a conflict with another core disciple about two years ago. Not long after that… that core disciple went missing.This matter made him extremely vigilant. What shocked him even more was that there was no follow-up investigation by those on the mountain. Moreover, the ones who knew of this matter kept their mouths shut, so not many people were aware about this.One had to know that the disappearance of the core disciple was a very big deal in the Seven Blood Eyes. However, it just so happened that the matter was left unsettled.After a moment of silence, the light purple-robed youth let out a cold snort and left without saying a word.This dramatic scene caused great waves in Xu Qing's heart. When he looked at the captain, many guesses surfaced in his heart."My spirit stones." The captain looked at Xu Qing and smiled.Xu Qing didn't say anything and directly handed over 20 spirit stones.After taking the spirit stones, the captain revealed a satisfied expression and glanced at the distant light purple-robed youth. "This person's name is Zhao Zhongheng. He's a good-for-nothing. If his grandfather wasn't an elder of the Seventh Peak, he would have been killed long ago. How could he still have a core disciple identity?""However, I heard that he was arranged by his grandfather to take up a post as a captain in the Dispatch Department. He probably wants to let him gain some experience there."The captain spoke while walking ahead. Xu Qing followed him silently, heading to the Homicide Department together.On the way, Xu Qing looked at the captain many times. When they were about to reach the Homicide Department, the captain tilted his head and looked at Xu Qing as he asked in surprise."Kid, you're really patient. Why aren't you asking me why I'm so amazing and why I could make the core disciple retreat?""Why?" Xu Qing asked.The captain looked at Xu Qing and felt his interest go away."You're very boring… Forget it, seeing that you're my team member, I'll tell you. Two years ago, I offended a core disciple and was planning to escape from the Seven Blood Eyes. But guess what, hahaha." "That core disciple died due to an accident when he was out at sea. After the sect investigated and discovered that it was indeed an accident, the matter was left unsettled. After that, for some reason… some of the core disciples on the mountain felt that I was quite mysterious.""So, most of them avoid me when they see me." The captain smiled at Xu Qing.Xu Qing nodded."You really believe it?" The captain was surprised."No." Xu Qing shook his head."Then why did you nod…"Xu Qing remained silent.The captain sighed and seemed to lose his interest once again. A while later, when the two of them saw the entrance of the Homicide Department from afar, he spoke softly from the darkness."The truth is that I killed him. This is my secret. Xu Qing, this secret is worth… 100 spirit stones!"After the captain finished speaking, he winked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing couldn't take out 100 spirit stones.The captain sighed and mumbled a few words. Only after he got Xu Qing to personally admit that he owed him a hundred spirit stones did he stretch his back and head to the Homicide Department's Black Division.Xu Qing rubbed his forehead and looked at the departing captain. He didn't feel helpless about the spirit stones he had been forced to owe. Instead, he heaved a sigh of relief.On the way here, the reason why he didn't speak was because he intuitively sensed a hint of killing intent faintly appearing on the captain's body. Also, the captain's cultivation seemed to be the same as the ninth or tenth level of Qi Condensation that Xu Qing had judged before. However, Xu Qing could faintly sense that the other party was hiding something. His true battle prowess was definitely stronger.

Chapter 110 The Secret Worth 100 Spirit Stones (3)
However, the other party's killing intent didn't erupt. After he agreed to owe the spirit stones, it quickly dissipated.Xu Qing was finally relieved. He turned his head and looked in the direction of Panquan Road in the distance. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.He quickly retracted his gaze and stepped into the Homicide Department. He then handed Sun Dewang over to the collection office of the department and took the bounty. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Before he left, he gave some spirit coins to the fellow sect member in charge of collecting the wanted criminals and politely asked him about Zhao Zhongheng.The disciple in charge of the collection kept the spirit coins with a fake smile and told Xu Qing about what he knew.His words were roughly the same as the captain's, but it wasn't as detailed. Xu Qing left after thanking him.On the way to his berth, Xu Qing's eyes revealed contemplation as he recalled the events of the night."The captain is very strong and also evil. He seems to treat me a little differently. What's his motive?"After pondering for a while, Xu Qing returned to his berth. A sense of vigilance rose in his heart as he took out a bamboo slip from his pocket. This item was very old and seemed to have been used for a very long time.On it was a densely-packed row of names that had been crossed out. There was one that hadn't been crossed out, and that was the Diamond Sect's ancestor.Xu Qing picked up the iron stick and began to carve the words 'Panquan Road's Old Man'.After that, he wrote the word 'captain'. He thought about it and added a question mark after the word 'captain'.He had carved the name because of the captain's previous killing intent. The question mark was because the killing intent had been neutralized by a hundred spirit stones.Xu Qing threw this matter to the back of his mind. He didn't want to probe into the captain's secrets, so he took out Sun Dewang's leather pouch and opened it.Looking at the content, he sank into silence.He thought of what the other party had said when he walked out of the gambling den.As expected, there was nothing valuable left in the leather pouch. Xu Qing frowned and tossed the leather pouch to the side. He then sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.Time passed by just like this, and Xu Qing, who had obtained 20 spirit stones, didn't head to Panquan Road again. That old man from the inn was suspected of trying to get rid of him through someone else, and Xu Qing had already started planning how he could quietly get rid of him.However, this matter was a little difficult, so Xu Qing didn't plan to act rashly and alert the enemy.During this period of time, other than cultivating, he used spirit stones to buy expensive materials to improve his magic boat.This allowed his level two magic boat to increase by two levels, reaching level four sturdiness.The appearance of the magic boat had changed drastically. Not only did its length and width increase by a lot, but the most important thing was that its body was covered not only with the scale totem from before but also with real scales. With such a dense amount of scales, the entire magic boat looked no different from a real crocodile on the surface of the sea. The feeling of cruelness it gave off was even more intense. This was especially so for the crocodile head, which seemed to have gained sentience. Its carved eyes revealed a hint of life.That was because Xu Qing had bought two pieces of spiral rock that enhanced sturdiness and replaced its eyes, allowing the defense of this boat to be more comprehensive.The original black canopy also became a hut. With the boat and the hut, Xu Qing felt even more sense of security.Not everyone in the harbor had such a level-four boat. Although the materials Xu Qing chose were all low-grade, they still attracted some attention in Port 79.There was nothing he could do about this. Even though he requested the shopkeeper to conceal the matter of refining, the effect wasn't great. Hence, Xu Qing could only be more cautious and vigilant.Fortunately, after so many years, being cautious and vigilant was already a part of his life.The rapid improvement of the magic boat sped up his plan to go out to sea.All of these made Xu Qing have more expectations for the magic boat. Although the expenditure was a lot, he felt that it was worth it.As for Zhao Zhongheng, he did not come to trouble him. He seemed to have been intimidated by the captain.At the same time, the Homicide Department no longer searched for Night Dove on the surface. However, the atmosphere inside had clearly become tense. This made Xu Qing feel that the time to reel in the net spread around Night Dove was almost here.Two days later, Xu Qing, who was already off duty, received a notice before he could leave the Homicide Department. No one was allowed to leave the Homicide Department today. They were to stay in their respective teams and wait for orders.Their voice transmission jade slips were also restricted.Xu Qing understood that they were going to draw the net tonight.This was indeed the case. Two hours later, just as dusk fell, Xu Qing, who was waiting with the team, saw the captain's figure."The department has decided that today, all the seven regions will draw the net on Night Dove. From the confirmed news, there are a total of 17 Night Dove's hiding spots in the port area. All teams from the Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow Divisions will be dispatched together.""Xu Qing, the location you handed over is correct. This time, our team is moving together with Team Three of the Earth Division. Our target is this location." The captain smiled at Xu Qing. After that, his expression turned solemn as he swept his gaze across all the team members.,m "In this stronghold, there are two people at the perfected Qi Condensation Realm, four people at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, seven people at the eighth level, and 25 others!""The department attaches great importance to this matter. Every team member of the team who kills the enemy leader at any stronghold will be rewarded with ten spirit stones. The person who kills the enemy leader will be rewarded with another eighty spirit stones!""Other than that, every head of Night Dove's members is worth ten spirit stones. Brothers, it's time to earn some extra money!"When Xu Qing heard this, his eyes suddenly narrowed. If he wanted to upgrade his level-four magic boat to level six, he only needed a dozen spirit stones if he chose low quality materials. However, if he wanted to choose the mid quality ones, he would need around eighty spirit stones. As for the high quality ones, Xu Qing didn't consider them. They were ridiculously expensive.During these few days, he was still worrying about how to obtain spirit stones. Now, when he heard his captain's words, Xu Qing's eyes gleamed.
