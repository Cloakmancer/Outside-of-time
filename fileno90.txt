Cross's hands were tougher than others as he drew the bowstring all year round. There were many calluses on them.Back then, when he encountered the black-scaled wolf pack and faced an entire day and night of slaughter, his hands didn't tremble as much as they did now. One could imagine what kind of fierce battle he had experienced before Xu Qing returned.Moreover, she must have encountered someone she couldn't resist, which was why her fingers were like this. At the same time, she was also heavily injured. From Luan Tooth's weak and exhausted expression, it was clear that she had used up all her strength.When he entered the campsite, everyone's reaction as well as those unfamiliar faces, as well as a large number of camp leaders outside the residence, as well as the cold gaze of the guy with the three-stroke beard were all telltale signs.All of this allowed Xu Qing to know who his enemy was. However, the more it was like this, the more uneasy he felt. Under his questioning, Cross and Luan Tooth also told him the reason in a low voice!In his early years, Captain Lei wasn't a scavenger but an ordinary man in a city far away from here.Due to his aptitude, he had once served as a guard in the city he lived in. It was also at that time that he obtained his cultivation method. He was also recognized by the city lord and had a fiancée who was his childhood sweetheart.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  Everything was beautiful but everything changed with the arrival of a convoy.Cross and Luan Tooth didn't know what exactly happened either. They only heard that Captain Lei got drunk once many years later and mumbled that everything was gone.His fiancée died and his cultivation was crippled after he completed his revenge. He barely survived and left his hometown, cultivating again with great difficulty and becoming a scavenger.Decades later, he became an old man with one foot in the grave.Captain Lei, who originally had the intention to retire, had let go of everything until…When he was at the campsite, he saw the foreign convoy and a person in it.The person who had destroyed everything he had didn't die and lived until now.However, Captain Lei didn't choose to continue taking revenge. He seemed to be worried that he would implicate others, so he bitterly chose to escape and hurried to Songtao City.However, he didn't know that his enemies were already aware of his existence. Hence, the camp leader arranged for people to capture Captain Lei from Songtao City a few days ago and gift him to his collaborator, who was also Captain Lei's enemy in his early years."I saved someone under the camp leader. Luan Tooth and I came back two days ago and he secretly told us about it. Only then did we know about it and immediately headed over to save them. However, we failed…"At the camp leader's place, I saw Captain Lei's enemy. The other party's foundation had also collapsed before and he was able to rebuild his foundation like Captain Lei. Although his foundation was higher than Captain Lei's, it wasn't by much" Cross said through gritted teeth."We have also made some inquiries about this convoy. Behind them is a mysterious organization called Night Dove."This organization is very large and has scattered countless convoys. In the entire Nanhuang Continent, they travel through various scavenger campsites and small cities, trading with the camp leaders and city lords, buying people to be… treasure-nurturers," Luan Tooth said in a low voice."Camp leader, the convoy…" Xu Qing's breathing was hurried and the killing intent in his eyes was extremely intense.He felt as though there was a ball of raging fire burning crazily in his body, causing his eyes to turn bloodshot. There was also overflowing anger in them as he turned and walked toward the main gate.Behind him, Cross and Luan Tooth were a little anxious and hurriedly advised:"Kid, we have to consider this matter at length. We need to cooperate with the other scavengers. This involves missing people for many years. We…""There's no need!" The instant Xu Qing spoke, he raised his right hand and grabbed the longsword on his back, swinging it fiercely.The longsword instantly transformed into a cold beam of light that shot toward the gate of the courtyard like a rainbow. The instant it entered, the tremendous force contained within erupted with a bang.The gate of the courtyard shattered into pieces, revealing a camp leader's guard eavesdropping behind the gate.This person held a dagger in his hand and his eyes were wide open. His chest was directly penetrated by the longsword and he fell to the ground. As he spat out blood, his expression was filled with horror.As for that longsword, the power it contained was too great. After it pierced through the guard's body, it headed straight for the alley entrance in the distance. As the man with the three-stroke beard let out a tragic cry, it pierced into his thigh at lightning speed, nailing him deep into the ground.The two casualties caused the outside world to fall silent for a short period of time. After that, whistling and low roars immediately erupted. The seven to eight guards from the camp's main residence who were surrounding the area also got closer.As Cross and Luan Tooth's expressions changed, Xu Qing dashed out like a bolt of lightning.The moment he walked out of the gate, his right hand grabbed the dagger of the dead guard and he arrived in front of one of them with a single step.He didn't even bother to take a look. The instant he walked past him, Xu Qing lifted the dagger and slit open his neck. Fresh blood spurted out in all directions but the redness couldn't be compared to Xu Qing's eyes.In his bloodshot eyes, the image of Captain Lei in the campsite personally seeing his enemy from back then surfaced. However, he couldn't help but suppress the bitterness and grief in his heart.This caused Xu Qing's killing intent to grow even stronger. He abruptly turned and punched out, landing on the chest of the guard who was about to attack.With a muffled boom, the man's seven orifices bled and his internal organs collapsed. His body then rolled backwards like a kite with a broken string and landed on the ground.At the same time, three other people pounced over with killing intent.Among these three people, two were at the fifth level and one was at the sixth level. However, the moment they got close, Xu Qing waved his right hand and the black iron stick instantly flew out.It directly pierced through the person's skull and the dagger in his hand gleamed coldly as he crouched down. He then appeared in front of the sixth-level person and ruthlessly swung it toward the neck. There was a click sound.The sixth-level person's reaction was also very fast. A spirit energy barrier immediately manifested to block Xu Qing's dagger but it couldn't stop his strength.As Xu Qing's eyes turned red, he suddenly pushed the man, causing him to retreat continuously. Amidst the rumbling sounds, the man was directly pushed against the wall by Xu Qing and pressed down forcefully.Under the horrors, the dagger cut through the spirit energy barrier and stabbed into the neck, piercing through it in an instant. The force was so great that the wall behind the corpse also collapsed with a bang.Xu Qing, who was standing there, turned his head. The killing intent in his eyes seemed to have materialized.This caused the hearts of the remaining four to five camp leaders' guards to tremble and their eyes narrowed. Even though their cultivation levels were at the sixth level, they still trembled and retreated one after another.Even the agonizing cry of the guy with the three-stroke beard stopped for a moment. His countenance couldn't help but turn pale and anxious.However, the slaughter was far from over.Xu Qing's body suddenly charged forward. The three to five guards' minds were buzzing and they wanted to speed up their retreat but it was still too late.Xu Qing's speed was too fast. After he got close in an instant, his left hand directly struck the top of a guard's head. After the guard's head shattered with a bang, his body moved like a ghost and strangely appeared beside another person. As the dagger in his hand slashed past, he moved again and arrived in front of the third person.This person trembled and let out a cry of despair. He opened his arms and wanted to hug Xu Qing, wanting to perish together with him.However, what awaited him was a violent bump from Xu Qing's forehead.The roar came to an abrupt end and the guard's forehead caved in. The moment he breathed his last, Xu Qing's body suddenly retreated and knocked into another person.The dagger in his hand kept stabbing out behind him. One slash, two slashes, three slashes…He only lifted his head after he knocked the person into another wall.Banging sounds rang out as all the guards fell to the ground one after another. All of them had died and there were no complete corpses!After killing so many people in a row, blood splattered onto the ground. Under the sunlight that was nearing sunset in the afternoon, the bloodstains on the ground were a shocking sight.When the light landed on Xu Qing's body, it caused the blood intent in his body to fill the air. When combined with his blood qi, he looked like a demonic god.It was also because of the massacre here that many scavengers who lived nearby immediately walked out and gasped when they saw this scene."It's the kid!!""He… Why is he so strong!""Those who died are all the camp leader's men. He's going to fight against the camp leader!"Cross and Luan Tooth also supported each other as they walked out. When they saw the corpses all over the ground and Xu Qing's figure and the blood on the ground under the sunlight, their hearts trembled intensely.Amidst the commotion, Xu Qing walked toward the trembling man with the three-stroke beard. On the way, he kept the dagger and iron stick until he was in front of the man with the three-stroke beard.The man with the three-stroke beard shivered as cold sweat continuously flowed down his back. It was as though the intense pain in his body couldn't surpass the terror in his heart. He wanted to struggle but the sword that was nailed to his thigh made it impossible for him to move at all. He could only let out a sharp cry with despair in his eyes."Kid, you are going to…"Xu Qing grabbed the longsword on his leg and slashed upward ruthlessly.The sharp blade slid down the man's thigh, past his stomach and chin. As fresh blood spurted out, the man's body convulsed violently as he let out a mournful cry and died!After doing all this, Xu Qing was expressionless. Only his killing intent rose. Under the blood light reflected by the sunlight, he walked forward step by step.The scavengers who were watching everything from the front also felt their hearts trembling. When they saw Xu Qing approaching, they immediately retreated to avoid him.They had seen ruthless people before but most of them were adults, and they were even desperadoes. For a fourteen or fifteen-year-old youth like Xu Qing to be able to kill so calmly and from the looks of it, he wasn't willing to give up, it was extremely rare."The direction he's going… is the camp leader's residence!"As everyone saw the direction Xu Qing was heading in, the sound of heavy breathing instantly became a roar in their minds, causing all the scavengers to follow behind in unison.From afar, Xu Qing was walking at the very front, rushing toward the camp leader's residence.Behind him, a large group of scavengers quickly followed. When even more scavengers heard about this, they also gathered.Other than that, there were also guards and strangers from the caravan in the camp's main residence. They suddenly moved closer to Xu Qing and there were experts among them who wanted to kill him!At that moment, in the camp leader's residence, the camp leader was drinking tea as he chatted and laughed with an old man with a cold and arrogant expression who was wearing a brocade robe."Mr. Sun, you don't have to worry. The matter will be resolved in the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. No matter how good scavengers are, they aren't a match for us Sect cultivators. I originally planned to nurture this kid well. If he's used well, I'll recommend him to the sect. However, since he's so blind, I'll just kill him.""It's better if you can capture him alive." The old man in brocade picked up the teacup and sipped. After he put it down, he calmly spoke.

Chapter ﻿62 To Have Power Over Life And Death
The moment the teacup was placed down, the long street outside the camp leader's residence was covered in blood and corpses!Xu Qing's figure was like a ferocious tiger. Wherever he passed by, fresh blood would splatter out in all directions and the ground would be covered in blood stains. It was a shocking sight. As he walked, he killed!In front of him, the guards of the camp leader's residence rushed over from all directions. There were also tens of black-clothed strangers. They were cultivators from the convoy.Both parties had the same target: Xu Qing.As he got closer, a gust of wind blew over, blowing the hair in front of Xu Qing. He decided to carry the longsword he wasn't used to on his back and held the dagger in his hand. His entire person seemed to have melted into the wind as he rushed toward a sixth-level Qi Condensation cultivator in front of him.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  In that instant, their heads intertwined and flew up!As blood splattered, more black-clothed men and guards rushed over.Xu Qing looked at these convoy cultivators and was in a daze for a moment. He recalled that Captain Lei had indeed gone out to buy ingredients on the day the convoy arrived but he returned very quickly.It was obvious that he had seen his enemy that day, so he had to leave early.Xu Qing fell silent and his killing intent grew even more intense. His speed erupted completely and he didn't dodge but rushed forward instead.In the distance, two people stood on the roof.One of them was old while the other was middle-aged. The old man wore a blue Daoist robe while the middle-aged man was dressed in tight-fitting clothes. The former stood with his hands behind his back and coldly watched the scene on the street.The latter sat there with a tendon-shaped rope in his mouth. Upon closer inspection, it was Cross's bowstring.Cross's bowstring was extraordinary. Ordinary iron weapons wouldn't be able to break it at all but in this person's mouth, it was bitten off piece by piece."Interesting. He's also a body refiner like me but he's only at the sixth or seventh level. He should be more fun than that person with the scar on his face.""Do you want to do it or should I?" the old man asked calmly."This is the territory of your Diamond Sect and the camp leader is an elder of your Sect. Of course, it will be you, a newly-promoted elder of the Diamond Sect." The middle-aged man spat out a mouthful of saliva that was laced with tendons and laughed sinisterly.As the two of them spoke, a loud boom rang out from the long street. There were even shrill cries echoing out as the seven or eight guards and men in black who surrounded Xu Qing retreated.All of them staggered and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood. Each of them had fatal injuries on their bodies as they fell to the ground one after another, revealing Xu Qing who had walked out from the encirclement of their corpses!He wore a fur coat that had been stained by countless amounts of blood, a pair of straw sandals that had been soaked black, long hair that swayed in the wind and a pair of… eyes that were as cold as a lone wolf's.His right hand was hanging down and the dagger he was holding had blood flowing down the blade, dripping onto the soil.The seven to eight corpses beside him all died in miserable states. It wasn't that Xu Qing wanted to torture them to death but all the injuries to their vital parts were extremely tragic.As for Xu Qing's attacks, his main focus was to kill. He didn't make any unnecessary movements, so the scavengers who saw this scene were all shocked once again.Xu Qing didn't look at the corpses. He was expressionless but the blood in his eyes was overflowing. He then stepped on the soil and moved forward rapidly.His target was the camp leader's residence which was over 3000 feet away from him.As he got closer, the remaining ten-odd black-clothed men and several camp leaders' guards in front of the camp leader's residence trembled in horror and instinctively retreated.After Xu Qing sped up, he lifted his head and looked at the two figures on the rooftop in the distance.The auras of these two people were the strongest he had sensed during his journey of killing. At the same time, they were also the two strongest enemies he had faced.Xu Qing was very clear that in today's situation, once he chose to make a move, he would have to… kill his way to the end. Moreover, their current location was the only path they had to take to reach the camp's master residence.So, after he took a few steps, he raised his left hand and used it to provoke the two people on the roof."Arrogant!" The blue-robed old man narrowed his eyes as a cold glint flashed in them. With a sway of his body, the wind kicked up beneath his feet as he directly leaped from the roof toward Xu Qing!This scene caused the hearts of the guards, black-clothed men and the scavengers at the back to tremble violently. From what they knew, only Foundation Establishment experts could step on air.To them, Foundation Experts were basically like immortals in the sky.Many people had never seen one in their entire lives. It could even be said that a Foundation Building expert could become an ancestor of a small sect or family like the Diamond Sect.This blue-robed old man clearly couldn't be at the Foundation Realm. He had just stepped into the 80% of Qi Condensation.Him stepping through the air was just a trick. It had nothing to do with the wind technique he cultivated. It didn't have any practical value and couldn't be sustained for too long. It was just a gimmick.However, to others, the shock brought about by this scene was enough to shock them. However, Xu Qing didn't care. Almost at the instant the other party stepped through the air and arrived, he secretly scattered the poison powder and rushed out instantly.He was so fast that he left behind an afterimage on the ground. In an instant, when the blue-robed old man's expression changed drastically, Xu Qing had already appeared in front of him.He directly punched out and a shadow of a kui appeared on his fist, letting out a soundless roar. This caused the old man who was in mid-air to have no time to dodge. He could only hurriedly form a seal to form a defense.With a boom, the old man's defense shattered inch by inch. Even the old man's body was forced back repeatedly by Xu Qing's punch. There was also a sharp gleam from the black iron stick that chased after the old man.There was a bang.The black iron stick was blocked by a shield.As the shield shattered into pieces, the power of the iron stick dissipated as well, revealing the blue-robed old man who was in an extremely sorry state as he coughed out blood from behind the shield.The old man's expression was ugly and he was about to speak. However, the expressionless Xu Qing stomped his right foot on the ground and his body moved closer with a boom.The old man's eyes narrowed and anger filled the air. As he raised his hands, a violent wind instantly appeared in his surroundings, sweeping in all directions. He then fiercely inhaled, and the wind instantly gushed into his mouth, causing his face to flush red. His eyes also revealed a hint of cruelty and torture and he was just about to spit it out.However, at the next moment, his expression changed drastically and his eyes bulged. His skin turned pitch-black and showed signs of being poisoned. His body then trembled intensely."You…"Before he could finish speaking, Xu Qing, who didn't stop at all, instantly got close.With speed, the dagger in his hand turned red as though it was being burned. Like a soldering iron, it ruthlessly sliced through the old man's neck.Fresh blood gushed out as he let out a blood-curdling screech. His head was then grabbed by Xu Qing's left hand and directly separated from his body as he moved forward.Everything happened too quickly!At the next moment, Xu Qing threw the greenish-purple poisoned head in his hand to the side of the middle-aged man who was standing on the roof with an extremely ugly expression and intense fear in his eyes.After that, he raised his left hand and provoked him just like before.Time seemed to have stopped at this moment.Be it the scavengers, the guards, or the people in the carriages, all of them felt waves of emotions surging in their hearts. All of them were dumbfounded, and indescribable shivers ran through their bodies."Too… too strong…""Is it poison… What a strong poison!" Among the scavengers, someone muttered with a trembling voice.The middle-aged man on the roof panted heavily."Are the Diamond Sect's members all trash? They want to show off when fighting!!"He was very clear that the blue-robed old man couldn't be so weak. The other party's wind art was very astonishing but his mistake was that he had stepped on air to show off and lost the initiative. He also underestimated the existence of the enemy so he didn't notice the poison and actually took the initiative to absorb a bellyful of it.At the end of the day, it was the ease of the sect's cultivators that caused them to be far inferior to scavengers in terms of ruthlessness and quick-wittedness when it came to tempering themselves under the struggle to survive.At the thought of this, the middle-aged man immediately took out seven to eight antidote pills and swallowed them in one go.After that, he gritted his teeth and cracking sounds immediately rang out from his body.His originally burly body became even stronger at this moment. He directly leaped up from the roof with large strides and charged toward Xu Qing like an eagle.Xu Qing lowered his head and the black hair in front of him covered his eyes. His body also sped forward, getting closer and closer to the enemy.In the next instant, their figures erupted with speed at the same time and directly collided.With a boom, the middle-aged man's entire body trembled and an even more intense horror appeared on his face. The hair in front of Xu Qing was blown back by the impact, revealing the sharpness in his blood-colored eyes.He could sense the astonishing power coming from the other party but it was still inferior to his own. Moreover, his recovery was even stronger. At this moment, killing intent erupted from his eyes and the power in his body surged as he punched out again!The battle between body refiners was simple yet brutal.They kept bumping into each other on the long street.As the rumbling sound spread in all directions, the impact also caused many houses to collapse.Gradually, the middle-aged cultivator's breathing became hurried. His face was pale and his body trembled. The veins on his body bulged and his eyes were bloodshot. He couldn't hide the fear and despair in his heart.In terms of strength and speed, he was inferior to Xu Qing, let alone his recovery ability.Hence, the entire process only lasted for about thirty breaths before his fist broke down into a bloody mess.His arm couldn't withstand the immense force from Xu Qing either and it shattered into pieces. Fresh blood and shattered bones scattered in the air as Xu Qing let out a blood-curdling screech. Xu Qing then leaped up and ruthlessly slammed his knee into the middle-aged man's forehead.With a bang, the sound of flesh being crushed replaced the agonizing cry. The latter's voice then came to an abrupt stop and he died.Xu Qing didn't even spare him a glance. The killing intent in his eyes was still as intense as ever. He stepped on the middle-aged man's corpse and leaped up, heading straight for… the camp leader's residence!At this moment, the guards outside the camp leader's residence and the people in the carriages were already frightened out of their wits.When they saw Xu Qing, who was covered in blood and rushing over like a demonic god, their desire to live surpassed everything. It was unknown who was the first to flee in all directions but they all scattered in the blink of an eye.Hence, under the shocked gazes of the scavengers who had gathered at the campsite, Xu Qing's figure stirred up the whistling of the wind as he headed straight for… the main gate of the camp leader's residence.The instant he got close, the gate collapsed with a bang. As the gate broke into pieces from the inside out, a fist stretched out and directly collided with Xu Qing.With a loud boom, Xu Qing retreated for the first time.He took three steps back and lifted his head. His hawk-like gaze coldly stared at the camp leader, who was wearing a golden robe and had an extremely ugly expression on his face.Behind him, there was a gloomy-looking old man in embroidered clothes who looked mean!The old man was holding a familiar figure in his hand!The instant he saw that figure, Xu Qing's body trembled violently as indescribable emotions churned intensely in his heart.That was Captain Lei.He was dying.

Chapter ﻿63 Kill Them All
"Ignorant brat!"The camp leader, who was dressed in a golden robe, had an extremely ugly expression. No matter what, he never expected that his men would be unable to take down this kid.This was especially so considering that he had boasted earlier that he would take care of it in the time it took for an incense stick to burn. Now, the time it took for an incense stick to burn had indeed arrived but the one who was taken care of was his guard."A bunch of trash!" A cold glint flashed in the camp leader's eyes. He stepped out of the gate and walked toward Xu Qing.As he moved forward, the spirit energy fluctuations outside his body grew increasingly intense and an astonishing amount of qi and blood burst forth from his body. His body under his robe swelled up, making his figure look like a mountain.There was even a faint golden light that spread out from his entire body.The camp leader was also a body refiner!However, it was obvious that the cultivation technique he cultivated wasn't a low-level technique like the Mountains and Seas Art. It was an ultimate technique from the Diamond Sect, the Diamond Technique.At this moment, under full circulation, his aura erupted and his footsteps instantly sped up. He transformed into a giant shadow and charged toward Xu Qing.His speed was extremely fast and he arrived in front of Xu Qing in the blink of an eye. He directly punched out and as he swung his fist, his entire body emitted a dazzling golden light that was filled with pressure.Xu Qing swept a glance at the old man in brocade robes and Captain Lei, who was standing at the threshold and observing the situation. He suppressed his anxiety and narrowed his eyes slightly.He was very clear that once he gained the upper hand, the other party would very likely threaten him with Captain Lei.This was something Xu Qing didn't wish to see. The only way to prevent this from happening was to act too suddenly!To be so sudden that the other party couldn't react in time.Hence, Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and similarly punched out, colliding directly with the camp leader.With a loud boom, Xu Qing's body staggered back seven to eight steps. However, he didn't move in a straight line but moved a few steps to the side.At this moment, the sunlight was behind him, reflecting the shadow on the ground. It also swayed as he moved.During the collision between the camp leader and Xu Qing, he could feel the power coming from Xu Qing. At this moment, his entire body trembled and he similarly retreated.However, when he lifted his head, a look of disdain appeared in his eyes. With a sway of his body, he charged toward Xu Qing once again. The cultivation base in his body circulated fully, forming a rumbling sound.His tone was disdainful and his gaze was filled with superiority. However, when he attacked… he went all out.What he revealed on the surface was intentional. After all, to be able to become the camp leader and make a group of scavengers feel fear, he couldn't be underestimated although he was a sect member."Diamond First Art!" The camp leader let out a low roar. As he spoke, his body swelled up once more and his strength and speed soared explosively. In the blink of an eye, he arrived before smashing down ruthlessly.Xu Qing lowered his head, causing the camp leader to be unable to see his eyes. After that, he lifted his hands and blocked the attack fiercely. With a boom, he retreated once again, and the swaying of his shadow became a little more intense as he moved.However, no one discovered it."Diamond Second Art!" Seeing that Xu Qing had actually withstood two of his attacks, the camp leader, whose cultivation had reached the peak of the eighth level of Qi Condensation, felt even more murderous.His body expanded once again as he threw another punch at Xu Qing.The golden light that erupted from this punch was even stronger. However, the instant it landed, Xu Qing abruptly lifted his head.The killing intent in his eyes erupted intensely at this moment. The location he moved to many times finally caused his shadow to face the old man in the brocade robe at the entrance.With the help of movement, he concealed the distortion he created when controlling the shadow.As for the sun in the sky, due to the angle, its shadow was elongated at this moment and it arrived not far in front of the brocade-robed old man.As Xu Qing lifted his head, killing intent erupted from his body. He ignored the camp leader's fist and leaped up abruptly.The instant he ascended, his shadow also abruptly crossed the distance between him and the old man.Amidst the distortion, a portion of the shadow abruptly extended out and directly covered the right wrist of the old man who was holding Captain Lei!Xu Qing's figure didn't fall behind at all on Captain Lei!This was also another important reason why he adjusted his pace earlier.In an instant, as Xu Qing let out a low roar, the shadow's strange power suddenly erupted.In that instant, the old man's expression changed. Intense pain and the eruption of anomalous substances caused his right hand to turn greenish-black.This sudden change caused him to instinctively release his grip on Captain Lei's body.The instant he let go, Xu Qing's entire body let out a rumbling sound. He endured the impact of the camp leader's punch and spurted out fresh blood as his speed completely erupted.His entire person transformed into an afterimage and directly disappeared from his original location, rushing toward the old man in the brocade robe.There was also an iron stick and a dagger that transformed into two streaks of cold light that were as fast as lightning. They whistled as they approached the old man in the brocade robe, forcing him, who was in the midst of having his right hand mutated, to retreat and dodge.As he dodged, Xu Qing rushed in and directly grabbed a hold of Captain Lei.He threw him out forcefully and Cross and Luan Tooth's figures quickly leaped out from the crowd. They caught it and quickly retreated.All of this happened in the blink of an eye. It was incomparably fast!"Your shadow!!" The expression of the old man in the brocade robe changed as he abruptly looked at Xu Qing. Everything that happened earlier was too sudden and unexpected. He couldn't react at all.The camp leader's eyes narrowed at this moment as well. Xu Qing's series of actions truly shocked him.Xu Qing wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stared coldly at the two of them. Under the setting sun, his figure was like a falcon as he spoke in a low voice."Now, it's my turn."As soon as he finished speaking, his body shot toward the old man in the brocade robe with a bang. Compared to body refinement, Xu Qing felt that the first person he wanted to kill should be someone who cultivated the Dao.At that moment, he charged out and instantly got close.The expression of the old man in the brocade robe was extremely ugly. He quickly retreated and performed a double-handed incantation gesture, pointing at Xu Qing. Immediately, fog rapidly condensed and transformed into the shadow of an evil ghost, charging ferociously toward Xu Qing.The camp leader also let out a low roar. His entire body erupted with golden light as he charged toward Xu Qing with a boom. Together with the old man's attack, they formed a pincer attack. Upon seeing the danger, Xu Qing's eyes gleamed coldly. At that moment, all the blood and qi in his body erupted.Amidst the rumbling, the power of his vital energy and blood swept out in all directions like a storm. A gigantic kui shadow materialized ferociously, letting out a soundless roar that shook the surroundings.Xu Qing raised both his hands and clenched them into fists at the same time. One on the left and one on the right, they landed simultaneously!When they landed, the shadow behind him split into two and pounced toward the camp leader and the old man in the brocade robe at the same time."Blood Qi Shadow Formation!! This… This…"The camp leader's expression completely changed. After his fist came into contact with Xu Qing's left hand, the golden light on his body instantly dimmed under Kui shadow's sinister smile. His entire body then violently retreated by seventy to eighty feet.As for the old man in the brocade robe, he also had a look of horror on his face. The evil ghost that transformed from his spell was trembling in front of the kui shadow. After the ghost was devoured by the kui shadow with a sinister smile, the kui shadow didn't stop and charged straight at the old man.An explosive sound echoed in all directions and the old man in the brocade robe coughed up blood as he rapidly retreated.However, at that moment, a blue barrier of light appeared around his body, causing him to only vomit blood. His injuries weren't too serious.The source of the light barrier was a talisman!This was… a talisman treasure!!Xu Qing's countenance was also pale. Although he was strong, when faced with the camp leader and this old man's pincer attack, his internal organs were also churning.At that moment, fresh blood flowed out but his viciousness didn't reduce in the slightest. Taking advantage of the camp leader being intimidated, Xu Qing's eyes erupted with killing intent as he charged toward the old man in brocade robes.He punched with all his might."You're courting death!" The old man's countenance was pale and his eyes revealed a sinister glint.As he retreated, he maintained the protection of the talisman treasure. At the same time, he performed a series of hand seals with both hands and fiercely waved them. Immediately, seven to eight evil ghosts appeared.Each of them was comparable to the seventh level of Qi Condensation. They let out cold roars as they attempted to devour Xu Qing.A ruthless glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He didn't dodge and allowed the evil ghosts to pounce over and tear at his body. His speed didn't decrease and his aura didn't weaken at all as he punched out.Amidst the rumbling, the talisman treasure's defense trembled.However, this item was a talisman treasure after all. Unless it was completely exhausted, it would be very difficult to destroy it.However, it was obvious that even this old man would find it difficult to obtain a second talisman treasure. Moreover, this talisman treasure had been used countless times and the words on it had become much dimmer and blurry.At that moment, under Xu Qing's bombardment, it was speeding up and becoming blurry.This caused the old man's expression to change drastically again.He could sense Xu Qing's ruthlessness and knew that he was in a life-and-death crisis. Hence, there was also madness in his eyes. He performed a series of hand seals and spat out a mouthful of blood, turning into a blood shadow that whistled sharply as it approached Xu Qing.However, at that moment, the blood and qi in Xu Qing's body were surging. He couldn't be bothered with the other party's spell at all. He risked being injured and threw out another punch!"Captain Lei is already in his twilight years but you still won't let him off!" Xu Qing's eyes were red. At this moment, the kui shadow roared at the sky and fused with his fist before smashing down.Although the talisman treasure could resist it, the violent tremor still caused the old man in the brocade robe, whose foundation had once collapsed, to cough up blood. His body retreated abruptly and the madness in his eyes turned into panic.A feeling of impending death caused him to let out a sharp cry."Zhang Shiyuan, what are you waiting for? Continue attacking with me!!"Zhang Shiyuan was the camp leader's name. When he heard this from afar, he suppressed the shock in his heart and rushed over.At that moment, there was also a bloody hole in Xu Qing's stomach where the blood shadow had pierced through. However, Xu Qing no longer cared about the intense pain. The blood and qi in his entire body erupted once again and the anger and madness in his heart reached their limits."Captain Lei has already chosen to dodge but you still want to pester him!""Captain Lei's life has been miserable, yet you still want to be ruthless!!"Xu Qing seemed to have gone mad as he threw out punches after punches. The kui shadow roared at the sky and coordinated with his punches to continuously land on the old man's defense.The rumbling sounds echoed throughout the entire campsite. The words on the talisman treasure became increasingly blurry but it still didn't shatter. However, the old man in the brocade robe couldn't withstand the tremors from Xu Qing's strength anymore.Waves of indescribable terror rose in his heart and the feeling of death grew even more intense.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  His talisman treasure had miraculous effects on spells but against the resonance force formed by the bombardment of body refinement, his body, which had once had its foundation destroyed, couldn't last for too long.As the old man continuously spat out mouthfuls of blood, he was filled with anxiety and despair.He wanted to shout for help but the assault of the resonance spread through his entire body, causing him to be unable to make a sound. Amidst his horror, his entire body trembled to the extreme. He was also unable to cast any spells due to the tremors and could only howl miserably in his heart."I… I don't want to die. I…"At the next instant, the veins on Xu Qing's forehead throbbed and his eyes turned red. He clenched his hands together and smashed them fiercely against the talisman treasure's protective barrier."Die!"An intense and astonishing power erupted. The talisman treasure's defense distorted but it still didn't collapse. However, the old man's body trembled intensely and his eyes bulged.At that moment, his body could no longer withstand the continuous tremors.His eyes instantly exploded and his internal organs collapsed. His flesh, blood, and bones directly shattered, turning into minced meat that became a blur!After doing all this, Xu Qing panted and turned his head abruptly. His right hand punched out and collided with the camp leader who was rushing over from behind.His injured body was instantly sent flying back by seventy to eighty feet. Many wounds on his body that had mostly healed opened up once again and fresh blood filled the air. At that moment, Xu Qing was covered in blood under the setting sun.As for the camp leader, his heart was also trembling intensely.He looked at his partner who had been blasted to pieces and then at Xu Qing, whose body was covered in blood but was still crouching there, maintaining his attacking stance. Xu Qing's gaze revealed killing intent as he stared fixedly at him and he felt a chill run down his spine.This scene also caused the scavengers in the surroundings to be shocked to the extreme. When they looked at Xu Qing, they revealed astonishment and… reverence.

Chapter ﻿64 A Song Of Remnants Of Love In The Red Dust
After a short period of silence, the camp leader looked at Xu Qing and suddenly spoke."Kid, let's forget about this matter. You've saved Captain Lei and this person is dead. There's no need for us to continue fighting to the death.""Moreover, I'm an elder of the Diamond Sect. If you fight to the death with me, it will be equivalent to starting a war with the Diamond Sect. My sect's ancestor is a Foundation Establishment expert!"Xu Qing fell silent and suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood. His body staggered as he lifted his right hand, wanting to wipe it away.At this moment, the camp leader who wanted to call a truce suddenly had a cold glint in his eyes.His entire person rushed toward Xu Qing with a boom. His speed was so fast that golden light erupted from his entire body at this moment. He seemed to have transformed into a Diamond's body."Diamond Third Art!"From afar, the camp leader's entire body was suffused with golden light. His aura was shocking and his killing intent was incomparably intense.On the other hand, Xu Qing's expression didn't change at all. His original intention to stagger instantly vanished, as though everything was fake. His raised right hand wasn't wiping the blood but he lifted it above his head. His bloodshot eyes then closed slightly.The image of the god statue that walked down like a god in the temple back then appeared in his mind. When he lifted his hand, it was peerlessly stunning, as though it contained some kind of Great Dao blade.He had imitated this strike countless times but he had never used it before.Now, he felt that he could use it.A beam of purple light erupted from his body, covering his entire body and his raised right hand.It was different from the golden color of the statue. After Xu Qing copied it, it emitted a purple aura.Under this purple light, the instant the camp leader roared and got close, Xu Qing's right hand slowly descended in a seemingly casual manner.There was nothing strange about it. It was very ordinary and simple. However, there seemed to be some extraordinary charm contained in this ordinary look.This extraordinary charm caused all the purple light to instantly gather on Xu Qing's right hand. At the instant it landed, a blurry… giant saber shadow appeared above his head!This figure was huge like a heavenly saber!Purple light rose and flickered, replacing the sunlight, replacing the golden light, replacing everything. As Xu Qing's right hand moved, it suddenly… slashed down!Thunder rumbled in the sky and the ground of the campsite rumbled. The strong wind was accompanied by piercing light as it rumbled and exploded in all directions like a tide.All of the scavengers involuntarily retreated. The camp leader's speed then slowed down until he stopped ten feet away from Xu Qing.He stared at Xu Qing in a daze and slowly lowered his head to look at the ground beneath his feet.Under his feet, a straight crack appeared on the ground… This crack was 70 to 80 feet long and it extended from under his body to his back."This strike…" the camp leader muttered. A bloody mark suddenly appeared on his forehead. This bloody mark instantly split open to his chin and then his chest. After that, fresh blood spurted out from his dantian. His body then directly split into two and fell to the ground. Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  The surroundings were completely silent. Only the sounds of hurried breathing could be heard, revealing the disbelief and horror in everyone's hearts.Under the setting sun, the afterglow scattered on the blood-stained ground, reflecting the lonely face of the youth. Drops of blood flowed down from his fingers and landed on the blood pool on the ground, creating layers of ripples.The figure in the ripples was a little blurry and couldn't be seen clearly but the desolate intent and coldness in his eyes could be seen clearly.Xu Qing silently put away the dagger that was covered in blood and the pitch-black iron stick. After that, he took the talisman treasure with blurry words as well. He then turned and walked toward Cross and Luan Tooth, who were in the crowd.Cross and Luan Tooth had looks of awe on their faces as they watched Xu Qing walk over. They watched as he silently took the unconscious Captain Lei who was on the verge of death and carried him away.Hence, he lowered his head and followed him into the distance.Under the setting sun, Xu Qing's shadow was stretched very long. The fresh blood that covered the ground revealed an indescribable sadness.The scavengers in the surroundings couldn't help but look at his figure and the blood and corpses that filled the long street.Behind Xu Qing, the blood seemed to form a shocking bloody trail.Some people recalled the bloody marks Xu Qing had left behind when he dragged the giant-horn python through the Beastfight Arena during the entrance training.Two scenes and two blood trails seemed to overlap at this moment."Kid!" It wasn't just one person but all the scavengers who had gathered here quickly shouted."Kid!!""Kid!!!"The voice grew louder and louder. There were old people, children, middle-aged men, and women with feathers on their heads.Their eyes slowly revealed fanaticism and their roars gradually echoed through the sky.This was… the unique salute of scavengers!…At dusk, at the entrance of the campsite.Xu Qing carried Captain Lei on his back. When he arrived here, he turned his head and looked at Cross and Luan Tooth.The two of them also looked at Xu Qing. There was reverence in their eyes but there was also a hint of complexity. They had guessed something. "Are we leaving?" Cross asked softly."I went to send Captain Lei on his last journey, and then… I will leave." Xu Qing nodded.Cross and Luan Tooth fell silent.Xu Qing felt a sense of farewell in his heart and cast a deep glance at them. After that, he shifted his gaze to the campsite that he had lived in for almost half a year."Take care." Luan Tooth stared at Xu Qing and went forward to help him tidy his messy hair. She didn't mind the fresh blood on his body and gently hugged him."What about you guys?" Xu Qing didn't reject Luan Tooth's hug and asked softly."We have to leave this place as well. Don't worry, Cross and I have our hands and feet and our strength isn't bad either. We can go to any campsite," Luan Tooth said with a smile.Cross still didn't speak but he stepped forward and hugged Xu Qing tightly.Xu Qing took a deep breath and waved to them. He then turned and strode out of the campsite's main gate, heading in the direction of the forbidden zone.Behind him, under the setting sun, Cross and Luan Tooth stood there silently as they watched him leave. When Xu Qing's figure disappeared at the end of the horizon, Luan Tooth mumbled."Cross, will we see him again in the future? Unfortunately, we still don't know his name." "I think so… Names aren't important." Cross said softly and grabbed Luan Tooth's hand.Xu Qing left the campsite and headed toward the forbidden zone.He carried Captain Lei on his back and moved forward silently. Just like how he had carried Captain Lei when he was heavily injured back then, just like how he had carried Captain Lei when they parted ways. It was the same path and the same person.However, he could sense that Captain Lei was getting lighter and lighter. The vitality in his body was also getting lesser and lesser and the aura of death was spreading uncontrollably.The sorrow in Xu Qing's heart grew increasingly intense.He silently stepped into the jungle and walked into the forbidden zone. He silently headed in a certain direction and continued walking. Time slowly passed. The sun had already set and night had fallen.However, he seemed to have sensed the blood qi and remnant killing intent on Xu Qing's body. No mutated beasts appeared in front of him on the way, allowing Xu Qing to continue moving forward sorrowfully.Two hours later, a weak voice rang out hoarsely from behind him."Kid, I just had a dream."Captain Lei woke up with a dazed expression as he mumbled.He didn't ask why he was here, nor did he ask why Xu Qing appeared, nor did he tell him about his experiences."I dreamed of Red Peach and you."Xu Qing's eyes were a little red and the sorrow in his heart grew even denser. He sped up but he tried his best to maintain a steady pace as he got closer and closer to his destination."In the dream, you were still very obedient. You always got first place in school."Captain Lei wanted to laugh but it seemed that these few sentences had exhausted more than half of his strength. His voice gradually weakened as he muttered softly before he fainted."What a good dream.""Kid, I can't hold on much longer."Xu Qing lowered his head and sped at full speed. On the way, he tried to use his purple crystal to help Captain Lei but it was useless. It couldn't keep his life.Finally, an hour later, he arrived at the place where they had met the singing voice that day. It was still the same area and the same big tree.At that point, Xu Qing gently put Captain Lei down and supported him against a tree. His eyes were red and his nose felt sour as he looked at the wrinkled old man who was on the verge of death."Captain Lei." Xu Qing said softly.The old man leaned against the tree and slowly opened his eyes.His eyes were cloudy as he stared blankly at the world in front of him. Only after a long time did he seem to recognize what this place was. He gradually smiled and there was a hint of light in his eyes."Kid, do you have alcohol?"Xu Qing silently nodded and took out a flask of wine from his leather pouch. He then placed it beside the old man's mouth and fed him a large mouthful.This sip of wine caused the light in the old man's eyes to become even brighter at this moment, like the final radiance of a candle.It was at this moment that he saw Xu Qing's reddened eyes clearly and laughed."Why are you crying?"Captain Lei seemed to have gained some strength. With Xu Qing's help, he struggled to sit up.Leaning against the big tree, he wanted to lift his hand to touch Xu Qing's head but he couldn't do it. However, the moment he gave up, Xu Qing slowly placed his hand on his head.The old man laughed."I'm still quite lucky. At the very least, at this time, I have someone to accompany me. I have wine to drink and someone to bury me after I die.""And in this world, how many people died a lonely and desolate death, silently exposing their corpses in the wilderness?"Death isn't scary. What's scary is that before I die, there isn't a single familiar person in front of me…"At this point, the light in Captain Lei's eyes slowly dimmed. He suddenly spoke."Kid, I want to take another sip."Xu Qing's heart was filled with sorrow. He took the flask and gently placed it beside Captain Lei's mouth. As the alcohol flowed out, Captain Lei looked behind him with a dazed expression as he mumbled."Red Peach, are you here to pick me up…"The wine spilled on the old man's clothes and landed on the soil. He didn't drink it but the light in his eyes was extinguished along with the fire of life.Xu Qing's body trembled as he lowered his head. He could no longer control the sorrow in his heart and it spread out from the bottom of his heart, enveloping his entire body.He gripped the alcohol flask tightly. Even though the alcohol flask had changed shape in his hands, he didn't notice it.A long time later, Xu Qing bit his lips and silently placed the alcohol flask to the side. He then lifted his head and looked at the old man who would never wake up.He couldn't help but recall the scene in the city ruins when the other party suddenly turned his head to look at him."Kid, are you willing to leave here with me?"Tears flowed down from the corners of Xu Qing's eyes.He removed the blood stains on his face, leaving two clear marks on his clothes.Growing up in the slums, he had stopped crying a long time ago.However, today, he couldn't hold it in. He looked at the old man's corpse until the sky turned bright again. He then silently buried the old man and the alcohol flask under a tree.Scavengers didn't need steles because no one would offer sacrifices.But the old man had a monument.Xu Qing stared blankly at the tombstone.After a long time, he took out a ball of sackcloth from his leather pouch and took out the only piece of candy inside.He silently placed it in his mouth, leaned against the tree and closed his eyes.Sugar. Very sweet.Someone had told Xu Qing that he would feel better after eating it when he was sad.

Chapter ﻿65 Growing Up
After a long time, the candy melted.The sunlight streamed through the gaps in the tree crown and landed on Xu Qing's face. It was as though the sunlight was like candy, melting into the depths of his heart.It soothed his grief.A long time later, Xu Qing silently opened his eyes and looked at the beam of light. He followed its source and looked at the sun in the sky before lowering his head to look at the old man's tombstone. He then sighed softly."Captain Lei, have a safe journey."Xu Qing stood up and bowed deeply. When he turned around, he used all his strength to suppress all the fragility in the depths of his heart. At the same time, he also buried the last trace of immaturity in his heart here with Captain Lei, making it impossible for it to crawl out at all.Fate had given him a trace of warmth but now, it was mercilessly snatched away by this world. This was the helplessness of the human world but Xu Qing had no choice but to continue on this path of life.His eyes slowly turned sharp again and there was a deeper look in them.His aura gradually gained sharpness and a hint of richness.With a flash, Xu Qing sped toward the edge of the jungle under the sunlight.His figure was extremely fast as he shuttled through the light spots. However, if one took a closer look, one would still be able to see the bleakness that remained on his body. That was something that the light couldn't dispel in a short period of time.It was so intense that it felt lonely.It was getting deeper.It was also getting colder.He was like a wolf cub that lived in a cruel jungle. After growing up a little in loneliness, he gradually got closer to becoming a true lone wolf.Time flowed by and very soon, a day passed. Xu Qing's figure didn't stop in this jungle. When the afterglow of dusk fell, he had already stepped out of the forbidden zone and entered the human world.However, the area he stepped out of wasn't within the campsite but on the other side.He wasn't prepared to return to the campsite.The death of Captain Lei's enemy would surely cause future trouble.Since the other party's organization was able to roam the entire Nanhuang Continent, it could be seen that their influence was extremely great. Although an insignificant person had died, there was a high chance that there was still an investigation.Xu Qing couldn't gamble on this. The most important thing was the camp leader's death.Xu Qing had heard of the Diamond Sect from Captain Lei.Although the latter had great influence, he was only a powerful dragon, while the former was the local tyrant.They were the strongest faction in the vicinity.The dozens of cities and scavenger campsites here were more or less related to the Diamond Sect and were directly or indirectly controlled by them.The ancestors of the sect had even reached the Foundation Establishment Realm.To the people and scavengers who lived in this area,Foundation Building cultivators were like immortals. Although very few people had truly seen it, the pressure and intimidation from Foundation Building cultivators caused everyone to feel reverence in their hearts.Hence, Xu Qing was very clear that since he had killed two of the Diamond Sect's elders, the first thing he had to face was the Diamond Sect's fury. The solution to this problem was very simple.He needed an even stronger force to intimidate the Diamond Sect so that they wouldn't dare to act rashly.This force was the Seven Blood Eyes.To the nearby cities and campsites, the Diamond Sect was a colossus. However, to them, the Seven Blood Eyes were the true heaven-supporting existence. Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Even if the Diamond Sect had a hundred guts, they wouldn't dare to provoke the Seven Blood Eyes.Hence, Xu Qing was very clear that as long as he became the Seven Blood Eyes' disciple, the crisis would be temporarily resolved.So, at this moment, when he walked out of the forbidden zone, he touched the Seven Blood Eyes token in his leather pouch and his eyes gleamed.He was prepared to make a trip to the Seven Blood Eyes!The Seven Blood Eyes was very far away from here. If an ordinary person wanted to go there, they would usually have to spend several years. During this time, not only would they have to cross the mountains but they would also have to experience various dangers.However, to a person with the token, everything was much simpler.On the back of the token, there was a map of the Seven Blood Eyes. At the same time, there were many bumps on it. Any one of them was the location of the Seven Blood Eyes' branch city.Anyone who entered any branch city with a token could enjoy a free teleportation.The closest one was Antler City, which was in the opposite direction from Songtao City.Unlike Songtao City, the entry permit to Antler City not only cost more spirit coins but also required the recommendation of the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples. Therefore, Captain Lei couldn't enter back then.At the thought of this, Xu Qing turned his head and cast a deep glance at the forbidden zone. After a long while, he turned around and sped away in the dusk. His target was none other than Antler City."Calculating the time, I should be able to reach Antler City in three days at most." Xu Qing estimated.He had never been to Antler City before but the name wasn't unfamiliar. This was because Antler City was located not far from the city he had lived in for six years and was now in ruins.At this moment, taking advantage of the darkness, Xu Qing's speed in the wilderness grew increasingly faster.Time flowed by and two days passed.It was correct that Xu Qing didn't return to the campsite.Currently, there were dozens of disciples from the Diamond Sect waiting coldly at the scavenger campsite. There were even seven to eight of them who stepped into the jungle to search.The reason why they found out about this matter so quickly was that there was a mix of scavengers. There were all kinds of people with ulterior motives. Unless he killed all of them, there would be someone who would leak the information.Hence, when the news spread to the Diamond Sect, the entire sect was enraged.To them, the death of two elders was a huge matter, especially to their reputation. It was also a form of provocation. Therefore, not only did they have to resolve it as soon as possible but they also had to use this to establish their might. It was just that after waiting for a long time, Xu Qing still didn't appear. Moreover, the forbidden zone was too big, so they weren't sure if Xu Qing had entered or not. As for the vast wilderness outside, it was inevitable that the Diamond Sect's men would scatter.So, after two days, they didn't gain anything.However, this matter couldn't be controlled and spread out, causing all the cities and scavengers in the Diamond Sect's territory to hear about it. This made them, who had searched for a long time, even angrier.At this moment, an angry shout rang out from the peak of the Diamond Sect's mountain.The Sect's mountain gate wasn't too far from Songtao City. It was located on a mountain peak and was built in a very luxurious manner. There were hundreds of disciples in the sect and there were many experts among them.Right now, the furious roars that echoed through the entire sect came from the main hall on the mountain peak."You haven't found him yet?"In the main hall, a middle-aged man in golden robes sat at the head of the table. His expression was dignified and there was anger in his eyes. The spirit energy fluctuations on his body also spread out in all directions amidst his anger, filled with pressure.Two people stood below him.These two people were middle-aged and both wore golden robes. Their spirit energy fluctuations were very intense, surpassing that of the camp leader. At this moment, they were both frowning. After a long time, one of them spoke in a low voice."Sect Master, the wilderness is too vast. Why don't we let the guards from those cities and the scavengers from the campsite head out to search together? This way, we'll be able to find them in three days at most.""Do you think it's not enough of a joke? A kid killed two elders and massacred the campsite. If we let them help us in this matter, our Sect's reputation will be tarnished!!" The sect master said angrily.The two people below fell silent and didn't speak anymore.A long time later, the Sect Master took a deep breath. His gaze was filled with intense killing intent as he pointed to the two people below."Elder Li, Elder Chen, the two of you are at the peak of the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Either of you can easily kill that kid.""I've already asked the ancestor and am preparing to borrow two tracking talismans from him for you. After the ancestor agrees to it, you guys can head out personally. No matter what method you use, I want to see that kid's head in twenty-four hours at most!"When the two elders below heard that the patriarch knew about this, their expressions instantly turned solemn.The gaze of the Sect Master was cold. After he finished speaking, he took out a jade slip and was about to ask the ancestor about it. However, at this moment, a cold snort suddenly rang out from outside the main hall like thunder.The voice was too loud, causing the two elders' hearts to tremble intensely. Even the sect master's expression changed. He immediately stood up and quickly walked down. Outside the main hall, an old man wearing a golden-red double-colored robe walked over.This old man had a tall figure and a ruddy complexion. His white hair was disheveled and there seemed to be lightning in his eyes, covering the gloom in them. As he walked over, a powerful spirit energy that far surpassed Qi Condensation spread out in all directions.Wherever he passed, cracks would appear on the ground.The aura on his body formed a storm that surrounded him. If one were to take a closer look, one would see that his feet weren't on the ground but were stepping on air.He didn't rely on the wind technique to soar through the air. Rather, he truly soared through the air.Also, behind him, there was a faint illusory shadow that looked like an angry Diamond. It was as though once it erupted, even the main hall wouldn't be able to withstand its might.His arrival immediately made the three people in the hall kneel in unison."Greetings, Ancestor!"The Sect's ancestor didn't speak. After he walked to the seat of honor and sat down, he coldly looked at the three people below. Finally, his lightning-like gaze landed on the sect master."Yunwen, have you forgotten the purpose of our Sect?!"The sect master broke out in cold sweat and immediately spoke."Ancestor, I haven't forgotten that our Sect's motto has always been that it's fine if we don't make a move, but once we do, we have to use our sharp metal energy to deliver a single blow. Therefore, I arranged for the two great elders to head out at the same time.""Foolish!" The Sect Ancestor glared at the sect master."This old man has carefully studied that kid's resume just now. This kid rose from an ordinary person in a short period of time. He was originally a new member of the Thunder Team but he killed countless people when he first entered the forbidden zone. Not only did he defeat the powerful Bloodshadow but he also saved many scavengers!He's even good at poison. With his cultivation at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, he once again killed two of our sect's elders despite being weaker and our disciples but he still managed to escape unscathed, causing you to be unable to find him even now.""There are so many people on the campsite but there are only two scavengers who snitched on us. This shows how popular he is!""Based on this old man's many years of reading through countless ancient books and experiences, you can either neutralize such a person or use your full strength to kill him.""Arranging the actions of the two of them in the past like this is no different from sending them to their deaths for someone good at defeating the strong despite being weaker!" In the end, the Sect's ancestor almost roared angrily.The three people below could only lower their heads and tremble in anger.The Sect's ancestor took a deep breath and snorted coldly. He then continued to speak gloomily."I can conclude that after the two of them go there, it'll be fine if they can't find him but once they do, they'll definitely be killed by the other party.""After that, you will get angry and choose to head there personally. You will definitely be killed as well.""At that time, when I go again, this kid will have already fled far away. Once he returns in a few years, he will probably be able to kill me with a single palm strike."Hearing the old ancestor's words, the sect leader was stunned and more sweat appeared on his forehead. However, in his heart, he still felt that things wouldn't develop like this. However, in front of the old ancestor, he didn't dare to refute.Hence, he could only lower his head and ask."Ancestor, please instruct me."The Sect's ancestor lifted his head and looked at the wilderness outside the great hall. His gaze was profound and he slowly spoke after a long time."Spread out all the disciples and search all the areas. At the same time, keep an eye on every city and scavenger campsite. The surrounding borders are the same.""The two elders will give me a flight talisman and a tracking talisman. Each of you will be responsible for half of the area and this old man will also participate personally. Once you discover something, immediately inform this old man to go over. Only then will it be considered a final blow.""This way, nothing will go wrong. I can also establish my might again and intimidate the thieves!"A moment later, the bell of the Sect rang out.A large number of disciples went out one after another. There was even the ancestor who brought the two great elders and flew into the sky.There were three shining runes in front of him that seemed to be guiding them, leading them into the wilderness. They split into three and sped away separately.

Chapter ﻿66 Inescapable Net
In the wilderness.Xu Qing's body was agile as he sped forward.He had been running for two days now. Because of his recovery ability, the fatigue caused by non-stop travelling didn't appear in Xu Qing.He even had a feeling that his body was completely active.During this time, he had also noticed the Diamond Sect cultivators who were dressed similarly to the camp leader from afar. However, with his careful dodging and speed, he managed to dodge them all.At that moment, he was only a day's journey away from his destination, Antler City. Hence, Xu Qing's path also reached a fork in the road.On the left was the city he had lived in for six years. That place had now become a forbidden zone. From afar, it was pitch-black in the dusk.The other direction was Antler City.Standing there, Xu Qing turned his head and glanced in the direction of the forbidden zone. After a few breaths of silence, his body swayed and he was about to rush toward Antler City. However, at that moment, his expression changed. He instantly crouched down and hid in the bushes.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and lifted his head to look at the distant sky.Over there, a golden rainbow was whistling past.Because the distance was too far, Xu Qing could only see the piercing golden light and couldn't see the figure inside clearly. However, the other party's spirit energy fluctuations were the same as the camp leader's but even more intense. This caused his mind to tremble."This pressure surpasses that of the camp leader…"Xu Qing only took a deep breath after the rainbow had left. A hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes.p In these two days, he encountered three waves of Diamond Sect cultivators but he carefully avoided them all. However, it was obvious that this time around, he felt the most danger."If I continue forward, I'll be able to reach Antler City in a day…" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and fell into deep thought. He knew that his current advantage was that no one knew that he had the Seven Blood Eyes' token on him.As such, it was very difficult to guess his destination.However, he still had an advantage. He didn't mind the dense anomalous substances in the forbidden zone. If he was careful, he could stay there for a long time.The other path's advantage was that if he acted quickly and caught the Diamond Sect off guard, there was a high chance that he could teleport away from Antler City.However, there were also drawbacks. Once he was discovered on his way to Antler City, this advantage would immediately be destroyed. It would be very easy for others to guess his destination and at the same time, his safety would be threatened.Going into the forbidden zone would allow him to stall for time.He would drag it out until the Diamond Sect was exhausted and relaxed. It would be convenient for him to do this and head to Antler City safely. Also, if he encountered any danger during this period of time, he would have some leeway to deal with them in the forbidden zone."Two methods, two choices…" Xu Qing muttered.While he was analyzing the pros and cons in his heart, the golden light that had flown far away earlier suddenly appeared again. This time, its speed was even faster.This abnormal scene caused Xu Qing to frown immediately. He hid himself and didn't move as he observed carefully. This lasted until the golden light flew past from afar. Its speed had clearly slowed down by a lot.This allowed Xu Qing to see the figure in the golden light clearly. It was a middle-aged cultivator.There was a rune on this person's right leg and it emitted spirit energy fluctuations as though it was supporting his body to fly.There was also a talisman in front of him and it was the source of the golden light.At that moment, the talisman light kept flickering and there was a blurry figure inside. Upon closer inspection, that figure was none other than the guard from the camp's leader's residence whom Xu Qing had killed.It was like a possessed body, sensing its surroundings like a hunting dog in the golden light.The middle-aged cultivator's speed became slower and slower, as though he was observing his surroundings. After a while, he changed his direction and continued searching until he was further away.This scene caused Xu Qing's heart to skip a beat."Treasure talisman!"He recognized the two talismans. Although he didn't know the specifics, he could roughly guess their function."Using the person I killed to sense my existence? The range isn't very large and the sensing is also blurry…" Xu Qing drew in a deep breath as he deeply realized the magic and profundity of the spell. At this moment, the analysis of the pros and cons in his heart instantly had a tendency."I can't continue heading to Antler City. The probability of being discovered in an entire day is extremely high. Once I'm discovered, not only will I be in a dangerous place, but my destination will also be exposed." Xu Qing made a decision. While the other party was far away, he dashed in the direction of the forbidden zone.He was prepared to hide there for a while before making a decision.While Xu Qing was speeding, not long later, when he was only an incense stick's worth of time away from the forbidden zone, the golden light in the sky behind him appeared once again.Xu Qing immediately hid. When he turned his head, his eyes suddenly narrowed.At this moment, the golden light seemed to have locked onto him and its speed suddenly increased, heading straight for him. There was also a sword light that whistled over at an even faster speed.This scene caused Xu Qing's expression to change slightly. He no longer dodged and his body suddenly swayed.The instant he left, a boom rang out. The sword light abruptly landed at the place he had dodged earlier, causing the soil to splatter everywhere and creating a violent impact.At the same time, the golden light in the sky instantly arrived, and a cold snort echoed out."Little brat, I've finally found you. So you wanted to come here!"As the voice rang out, the golden light approached and the middle-aged man's figure was clearly revealed. This person had a square face and wore a golden robe. His height was ordinary and his appearance was ordinary. Only his brows were extremely heavy, making him look very conspicuous. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  At this moment, under his thick brows, his eyes were filled with coldness and killing intent as he looked in the direction of Xu Qing.Almost at the instant he lowered his head to take a look, Xu Qing stomped the ground with his right foot and leaped up with a boom, charging toward the middle-aged man in the air.The middle-aged cultivator sneered. The first time he passed by this place, there was an abnormality with the tracking talisman. Hence, he searched carefully and finally locked onto Xu Qing's location. When he saw Xu Qing approaching, his body instantly rose.After reaching a height that Xu Qing couldn't reach, the moment Xu Qing's momentum dissipated and his body fell, the middle-aged cultivator lifted his right hand.As a storm appeared in the surroundings, he suddenly pointed.At that instant, the storm descended and directly drowned Xu Qing's figure.Amidst the rumbling, Xu Qing landed on the ground in a very sorry state. His body then swayed as he headed straight for the forbidden zone.The middle-aged cultivator wanted to give chase but at the next instant, a cold light flashed from Xu Qing, transforming into a dagger that flew toward the middle-aged cultivator at an astonishing speed.The middle-aged cultivator narrowed his eyes and soared into the air to dodge."Petty tricks!"On the ground, Xu Qing cast a deep glance at the middle-aged cultivator but didn't speak. He then unleashed his full speed and sped up.He had already realized that he was no match for this person.If the other party couldn't fly, he could still return the favor and drag the other party to death.However, against an opponent who could fly, Xu Qing didn't have much of a choice.One was in the sky while the other was on the ground. In such a fight, he didn't have any advantage.At that moment, Xu Qing's speed erupted as he ran with all his might. Behind him, in the sky, the golden-robed middle-aged man sneered and directly took out a jade slip to transmit his voice to the ancestor. After that, he increased his speed and chased after Xu Qing. With a series of hand seals, rays of spell light blasted toward the ground.As a Great Elder at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, his spirit energy was very abundant and he had mastered many spells.From afar, one could see numerous wind blades and fireballs continuously bombarding him, causing Xu Qing, who was running on the ground, to be exhausted from dealing with them. Even if he dodged, he would still be affected by the shockwaves and blood slowly seeped out from the corner of his mouth."The old ancestor is too cautious. I don't need him to come. I can already kill you." The middle-aged cultivator in the air sneered.Although he said this, he didn't land on the ground. Even though Xu Qing was in a sorry state many times, he still maintained a certain height. His hands formed a seal and a storm rose once again, blasting toward the ground.Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. Such a passive beating made the killing intent in his heart even stronger.However, he was very clear that although the other party seemed to be alone, he definitely had a way to contact the sect. If he didn't end the battle quickly and enter the forbidden zone, his situation would become even more dangerous as time passed. This was especially so when the other party mentioned the old ancestor, causing Xu Qing's heart to tremble.However, the other party didn't lower his altitude at all. This caused Xu Qing to be unable to retaliate. He had displayed weakness several times previously but he was still unable to lure the other party down."This person is too cautious. We can't wait any longer."At the thought of this, purple light flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The instant the other party's storm descended and drowned him, a purple saber shadow suddenly appeared in the storm.In the storm, Xu Qing spat out fresh blood. He withstood the damage from the other party's spell and swung his right hand down.At that instant, the heavenly saber appeared once again and slashed down.An extremely intense life-and-death crisis directly erupted in the heart of the middle-aged cultivator in the air. His expression changed drastically as he rapidly retreated and used the flying talisman to fly into the air with all his might.The moment he rose into the air, the void beneath him rumbled with astonishing might. When the saber shadow arrived, it was as though it could cut through everything. It whistled past under his body with extreme danger.If he had been slightly slower in dodging, or if he had lowered his height earlier, he would probably have been slashed down by this saber with the momentum of thunder.At that moment, although he had dodged death, his left foot was still touched. It directly collapsed and his flesh was badly mangled.Enduring the intense pain, the middle-aged cultivator's breathing became hurried. The killing intent in his eyes was intense but the vigilance and lingering fear in his heart were even more intense. He was very clear that if he didn't have the flying talisman, he would definitely be heavily injured if he was slashed by that astonishing saber strike."The ancestor is right. This kid is strange!"On the ground, Xu Qing wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and coldly glanced at the middle-aged cultivator whose left foot was badly mangled. He suppressed the regret in his heart and turned to continue speeding toward the forbidden zone.At that moment, the middle-aged cultivator in the sky was in unbearable pain. After sealing his wound, he lowered his head and looked at Xu Qing. Although the killing intent in his heart was strong, he still hesitated for a moment and didn't dare to continue approaching. Instead, he increased his altitude and used a spell to interfere.He wasn't prepared to act alone. Compared to completing the sect's mission, his life was more important. Hence, he planned to drag it out. Even if the other party wanted to enter the forbidden zone, he would still allow it to happen."When the ancestor comes, this kid will die!"Hence, under the situation where he didn't dare to get close, although the spell also injured Xu Qing, Xu Qing's recovery speed was astonishing. Hence, the impact wasn't great and his speed became faster and faster.This lasted until Xu Qing saw the edge of the forbidden zone. His body then swayed and he quickly stepped in.Outside the forbidden zone, the middle-aged cultivator's figure paused in mid-air. Just as he was hesitating on whether he should chase after them, lightning suddenly appeared in the sky behind him. As it rumbled, two figures whistled over.The former wore a red robe and his white hair fluttered in the wind. He exuded a dignified aura.The shadow of Diamond on his back transformed into a storm that shook the surroundings. It was the Diamond Sect's ancestor.The latter was another elder of the Sect. The two of them approached rapidly one after another.

Chapter ﻿67 The Faceless Woman In White
When Xu Qing, who had stepped into the forbidden zone, saw this scene, his eyes narrowed. An intense life-and-death crisis erupted in his mind and all the flesh and blood in his body trembled uncontrollably at this instant.All of this came from… the tall old man in red robes who was rapidly approaching from the distant horizon!"Foundation Building!"The name of this realm instantly appeared in Xu Qing's mind.The might of this pressure was too great. Even though Xu Qing was still far away, the shock he felt was still astonishing.The other party's identity was self-evident.It was the Diamond Sect's ancestor.This was especially so for the gigantic shadow behind the other party. That Diamond body that contained rage was like a heavenly soldier, causing Xu Qing's eyes to sting at this moment.This made him feel the same as when he saw those Qi Condensation rogue cultivators from afar in the slums back then.It was a similar feeling but the degree of it far exceeded it.In fact, with just a glance, he felt as though he had been locked onto by the other party. Even if he closed his eyes, he couldn't help but imagine the tall figure of the other party.This figure seemed to be burning, causing his head to ache faintly.From a certain perspective, this could already be considered a psychological injury.However, Xu Qing had controlled his shadow many times, so he wasn't unfamiliar with this feeling.At the same time, he had made some progress in his first strike of the God Statue and his mental fortitude had grown. Hence, although he felt a dull pain in his head at this moment, it didn't affect his movements. He sped up even more.As he ran into the forbidden zone, he lifted his right hand and took out a handful of black pills before tossing them behind him.The black pill landed on the ground and directly exploded. After the seven-leaf medicinal herb juice on the surface dissipated, the spreading black medicinal pill dust rapidly spread in all directions, forming a vortex that caused the anomalous substances in the forbidden zone to surge over instantly.From afar, it could be seen that Xu Qing had thrown out over ten black pills. All the anomalous substances that spread out were as dense as a tide, gushing over from all directions.The middle-aged man with thick eyebrows who was about to enter the forbidden zone couldn't help but pause. His expression changed and he didn't dare to get too close for a moment.This black pill was precisely the failed product of Xu Qing's white pill refinement. At that time, he felt that it was a pity to throw it away. After all, it wasn't completely useless. Hence, he kept it and used it at this moment. It was the perfect time.As the anomalous substances gushed over from the surroundings, the density of anomalous substances in the large area behind Xu Qing instantly became incomparably shocking. His figure then continued to gather the anomalous substances as he sprinted at full speed.Not long later, as the rumbling echoed out, outside the forbidden zone, the rainbow that was on the horizon earlier suddenly approached.After reaching the edge of the forbidden zone, the eyes of the Diamond Sect's ancestor flashed with killing intent. He didn't stop at all and abruptly stepped in with a boom.The two Diamond Sect elders behind him also gritted their teeth and followed.Just like that, the three of them entered the dense anomalous substances. Although they rushed out very quickly, what awaited them was still the arrival of anomalous substances. There was even a large amount of poisonous fog contained within."Ancestor, this kid is very strange!" The middle-aged cultivator whose left foot was badly mangled hurriedly reminded the ancestor.The Sect's ancestor let out a cold snort and fiercely blew a breath forward. A storm instantly formed and rumbled as it spread out in all directions, instantly blowing away all the fog in the surroundings.His figure didn't stop at all. He grabbed the two elders beside him and suddenly rushed out, speeding up his pursuit in the direction Xu Qing had left in.However, at this moment, the sky was already past dusk and the darkness was rapidly descending. Amidst the increasing chill in the surroundings, the anomalous substances that permeated this place were also denser.If they continued to fly here, it would still be fine for the Sect's ancestor. However, that thick-browed elder was already injured and he would feel uncomfortable after some time.Hence, the Sect's ancestor coldly spoke."The two of you, follow behind me. I'll go capture this kid first!" As he spoke, the Diamond Sect's ancestor circulated his cultivation. The Diamond behind him roared at the sky and his figure quickly expanded to a height of over 300 feet. He then strode forward like a giant and ran.Every step he took covered an area of hundreds of feet that was the same as his height. As for the Sect's ancestor, he was standing on top of the Diamond Giant's head.From afar, if one didn't have a certain amount of spirit energy, they wouldn't be able to see the shadow of Diamond. All they could see was the Sect's ancestor standing in the air as though he was floating, moving further and further away."Ancestor is mighty!"The two elders at the back had excited expressions at this moment. They had already determined that if the ancestor personally acted, that kid would die."I believe the ancestor will return with that brat's corpse very soon."The two of them were certain.However, time slowly flowed by. Two hours later, the expressions of these two Vajra Sect elders changed. As they sped, they looked at each other and saw the bewilderment in each other's eyes.At the end of their vision, they could no longer see the figure of the ancestor. Clearly, the ancestor had chased far away.It was just that they couldn't understand how a body-refining Qi Condensation cultivator's speed and ability could make the ancestor unable to deal with it even now.They were puzzled but the Sect's ancestor was even more puzzled.At that moment, in a place far away from these two elders, the expression of the Sect's ancestor was extremely ugly. He looked at the figure of a youth in the distance who was currently running at an astonishing speed.Although the other party's speed was still inferior to his, the difference wasn't that great.Every time he punched out, the huge fist shadow formed by him would combine with the Diamond fist beneath him. After the fist passed through the air, Xu Qing's body in the distance would glow and transform into a defensive barrier.Amidst the rumbling, although the protective barrier trembled and cracked, the youth inside borrowed the force to increase his speed.At the same time, due to the descent of night, the anomalous substances here, which were already very dense, continued to gather on the way where the youth had left, causing the surroundings to feel even colder.All of this caused even the Diamond Sect's ancestor to feel some fear. He wanted to make a detour from time to time. This inevitably caused his speed to be affected and it would take time for him to catch up."Damn it!" As the expression of the Sect's ancestor darkened, Xu Qing, who was in the distance, had a pale expression. A large number of blood vessels appeared in his eyes, and the veins on his forehead bulged as though they were about to explode.His left hand was clenched tightly and the blood vessels on it bulged. It was a shocking sight.  n(ovelbin[.]nEt There was a scorpion tail in his palm.After the battle with Fire Crow back then, there were still remnants of his scorpion tail. However, at that moment, even though all of the scorpion tail had pierced into the flesh of his palm, the little amount of poison left in it was still unable to provide him with a continuous overdraft.It could only boost his speed for a short period of time.In his right hand was an incomparably blurry talisman.It came from Captain Lei's enemy.However, the talisman was about to dissipate and Xu Qing was very clear that the enhancement from the scorpion tail poison was rapidly weakening. It was about to lose its effect.Fortunately, at such a speed, he could already see the familiar ruined city from afar.Closer and closer.Finally, at the instant the effects of the scorpion tail dissipated, Xu Qing's speed slowed down. However, he gritted his teeth and fiercely leaped into the air. On this dark night, under the demonic moonlight, his figure instantly landed on the city wall.This place… was Xu Qing's target.He couldn't fight against the Diamond Sect's ancestor and the two elders at the back. Hence, Xu Qing's plan needed the right timing and location!His timing was the anomalous substances in the forbidden zone.His geography was the familiar city.Humans were the reason for the strangeness in the city and the mutated beasts in the city lord's residence.With these, he felt that he had a chance of escaping.At that moment, the instant he landed on the ground, due to his speed being slightly slower, an ear-piercing whistling sound instantly rang out from behind him. A gigantic fist shadow appeared out of thin air, directly traversing the distance and appearing behind him. The fist then punched out fiercely from afar.Boom!The talisman defense suddenly collapsed.Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood as his internal organs trembled. Some of them even shattered and his injuries were extremely serious.The intense pain caused Xu Qing's vision to blur. However, he still gritted his teeth and charged forward, landing in the city. He then proceeded madly on the familiar streets.After a few ups and downs, his figure disappeared from the city.Not long later, the whistling sound outside the city neared. The red-robed Diamond Sect's ancestor suddenly arrived.His expression was cold as he rotated his right wrist.That punch just now was the limit of the distance he could throw out. Although he had the talisman treasure to block it and it didn't completely crush the enemy, he was confident that as a Qi Condensation cultivator, he would be heavily injured even if he didn't die from the remaining force of his punch when the talisman treasure collapsed.Hence, with a sway of his body, he stepped into the city. However, the instant the Diamond Sect's ancestor stepped into the ruined city, his expression suddenly changed as he heard someone crying.A cold aura suddenly spread out from the street where Xu Qing had disappeared.On this dark night, under the demonic moonlight and amidst the cold, a woman's figure slowly walked over from the distant street.This figure looked very small from afar but as it moved forward, it grew larger and larger. It even exceeded the height of the surrounding houses but didn't slow down. In the end, it reached a height of over 100 feet.She wore a long white dress and had extremely long black hair. However… she had no facial features.There was nothing on her empty face.Only the countless human faces on her long skirt were crying.After these cries gathered together, they turned into mournful cries that spread in all directions. At the same time, the white-clothed, faceless woman slowly walked toward the Diamond Sect's ancestor.As they arrived, the crying grew louder.This scene caused the Diamond Sect's ancestor to gasp. Even someone as powerful as him felt his heart tremble. He knew what this was but the more he knew, the more reverence he felt.Therefore, he didn't hesitate at all. He immediately changed directions and quickly dodged.However, he hadn't given up on pursuing Xu Qing, so he didn't leave the city. Instead, he entered the city from another direction."That brat is only at the Qi Condensation Realm. The possibility of him surviving after encountering danger here is extremely small. However, I won't be at ease until I see him die." The Diamond Sect's ancestor's eyes revealed killing intent.His experience told him that his previous judgment was correct. A person like the kid… Unless he resolved the conflict between them, if he couldn't kill him today and allowed the kid to live, then the future him would definitely be slapped to death by the kid one day.Hence, after changing directions and entering the city, the Diamond Sect's ancestor immediately started searching carefully.He wanted to see the person alive and the corpse dead!At the same time, while the Diamond Sect's ancestor was searching, Xu Qing had already returned to the cave he had hidden in. He sat cross-legged and meditated, his chest heaving. Only when he spat out mouthfuls of blood did his pale face regain some color.After wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Xu Qing lifted his head and looked outside through the gap. His expression was gloomy. After a long while, he gritted his teeth and began to circulate the Mountains and Seas Art.After Xu Qing recovered, his cultivation that was about to break through finally reached the critical point."I have to break through to the seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art!" Xu Qing didn't hesitate and immediately attempted to break through. At the sixth level of the Mountains and Seas Art, he already possessed the kui shadow of a fledgling. For example, he could kill someone at the eighth level of Qi Condensation like the camp leader with all his strength, but it was a little difficult for him to kill someone at the ninth level.This made Xu Qing look forward to breaking through to the seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art."For the Mountains and Seas Art to be so sharp with me, it should be related to the purple crystal. It's augmenting me!" Xu Qing had long realized this point.At that moment, he took a deep breath and endured the pain in his chest as he closed his eyes to cultivate.

Chapter ﻿68 Kui Shadow's Grand Formation
In the ruined city, in the cave Xu Qing was in, the ground was covered in bird feathers, mixed with an unpleasant-smelling turbid air.The rocks and miscellaneous items that he had used to block the gap were now severely corroded by the anomalous substances. There was also more dust in the surroundings than when he left.Evidently, even if the forbidden zone was formed, there would still be scavengers coming to investigate. However, his shelter was too hidden, so no one came here after he left.Hence, the smell of dust and decay mixed together entered Xu Qing's nose continuously but he didn't mind.At that moment, Xu Qing was sitting cross-legged and meditating. The Mountains and Seas Art in his body was fully circulated. After accumulating strength, he was trying his best to break through to the seventh level.In the outside world, the roars and strange mournful sounds were mixed with cries that caused one's hair to stand on end. This caused Xu Qing to be in a trance for a moment, creating an illusion.It was as though he had returned to half a year ago.At that time, when the gods opened their eyes and the blood rain descended, he was struggling to survive in this city filled with bones.Xu Qing fell silent.After a long time, the past no longer surfaced in his mind. His mind was completely immersed in his cultivation. As the cultivation in his body continued to circulate, the spirit energy in the surroundings slowly gathered and flowed rapidly into the pores on his body.The thumping sounds gradually reverberated in his body. The sounds grew louder and louder and in the end, they turned into a rumbling sound that reverberated in his mind.Accompanying the rumbling were the black-colored impurities secreted from the pores all over his body. These impurities were increasing in number and density.As it was secreted, the body under Xu Qing's clothes also erupted with astonishing strength at that instant.All of his blood vessels bulged and his flesh and blood were constantly being torn and compressed. His bones also emitted sounds.Two hours later, as the thunderous sound in his mind exploded, Xu Qing's eyes abruptly opened. Purple light then erupted from his pupils.At this moment, the kui shadow appeared behind him once again.But this time… his shadow was completely different from before!Its entire body was even darker and its body was even more muscular. There was no longer a single horn on its head but a pair of bull-like horns instead. Moreover, they were in the shape of a spiral and there was faint black lightning lingering at the tip.Its face was even more sinister. When its bloody mouth opened, it looked as though it could devour evil ghosts alive.This was especially so for its sharp claws. Coupled with its purple eyes, it exuded a soul-stirring viciousness.Powerful fluctuations spread out from the shadow, as though they could penetrate the cave and shock the surroundings.Kui Shadow, Grand Formation!This was a transformation that could only occur when one had perfected the Mountains and Seas Art. If it was anyone else, they would have already reached the peak of the Qi Condensation Realm after cultivating to this level. They wouldn't be able to improve further. However, Xu Qing was only at the seventh level.As for his body, it had also changed greatly at this moment. His body was longer and more refined. The purple light in his eyes also lasted longer than before.Especially his face…If it was said that he was incomparably handsome when he was at the sixth level of the Mountains and Seas Art, then at this moment, under the purple light in his eyes, even though his face was covered in dirt, he wasn't far from being demonic.However, Xu Qing didn't care about these. What he cared about was the energy that was bursting forth from his body.Hence, he quickly lowered his head and looked at the bulging veins on his clenched fist as well as the veins on his arm.As the purple light in his eyes slowly dissipated, he could clearly sense his strength…It was more than double the amount from before!"Strength of one kui?" Xu Qing mumbled as he surveyed his surroundings.It was pitch-black outside and there was no light in the cave either. Although Xu Qing could barely see everything, he couldn't see a shadow.However, with his perception, he could sense the existence of the shadow. Hence, after pondering, he attempted to control it.Five minutes later, Xu Qing's eyes revealed a hint of excitement and wonder.His perception told him that his control over the shadow was much better than before. He could even control it slightly, allowing a portion of the anomalous substances contained in the shadow to return to his body.Although it was useless to do so, it could indirectly prove that his control over the shadow was more flexible.All of this made Xu Qing feel that with his current battle prowess if he were to encounter the camp leader again, he wouldn't even need the Divine Statue's Heavenly Saber. He only needed a single punch… to shatter the arm of the camp leader who was at the eighth level of Body Refinement."Unfortunately, the gap between me and the Diamond Sect's ancestor is still too great."Xu Qing shook his head. Although he hadn't truly fought with the other party, his escape along the way and the fist shadows from the Sect's ancestor allowed him to clearly understand the gap between them.Hence, even with the shadow catching him off guard, Xu Qing was very clear that it was impossible for the current him to have the strength to fight against Foundation Establishment cultivators."However, if I encounter those two at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, I can still kill them."A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he looked outside through the gap in the cave.The roars and strange sounds rang out one after another, sometimes near and sometimes far, forming a clear contrast with the silence in the cave.This scene caused Xu Qing to once again feel as though he had returned to half a year ago. He instinctively took out the iron stick and slowly held it in his hand, musing in his heart about what he should do next.If he left now, he felt that there was a high chance that he could successfully reach Antler City.However… Xu Qing was a little unwilling. Killing intent flashed in his eyes."If I don't kill those people, this hidden danger will make me feel very uneasy." Xu Qing narrowed his eyes as the map of the entire city appeared in his mind.He was very familiar with this city.At that moment, as the streets appeared one after another, be it the location where the mutated beasts were sleeping or the bird's shelter, everything appeared clearly in his mind as he began his analysis. "City lord's residence!" A long time later, Xu Qing mumbled as the coldness in his eyes intensified.He planned to leave the city first. It would be fine if he didn't encounter anyone from the Diamond Sect on the way but if he did, he would counterattack according to the established method.Sensing the roars from outside, Xu Qing's expression turned decisive. He moved the miscellaneous items blocking the entrance away and slowly crawled out.The entrance to this spatial rift was narrow. Xu Qing's body had grown a little bigger now, so it was a little difficult for him to exit. However, his expression was as usual. After he squeezed his way out, even though his body was injured, his injuries would heal very quickly.After coming out, Xu Qing was on his guard. He looked at the pitch-black surroundings and directly rushed out. He proceeded carefully into this ruined city.This level of caution even exceeded that when he was in the depths of the jungle in the forbidden zone.Compared to that place, there were more mutated beasts and bizarre existences in the city at night.Fortunately, Xu Qing understood the structure of the city. Hence, although he encountered some dangers on the way, he mostly avoided them with his speed and familiarity.If he really couldn't avoid it, he would swiftly neutralize it and leave once again.Just like that, under the influence of the dense anomalous substances, Xu Qing carefully advanced through the city for over an hour. Just as he was about to reach the edge, he suddenly heard a rumbling sound in the distance.This voice caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow.In the dark night, his gaze was like that of a lone wolf turned sharp as he moved closer to the source of the sound. After the time for an incense stick to burn, he saw two figures being chased by seven to eight mutated beasts.These two people were the elders of the Diamond Sect.They only arrived at the city after Xu Qing and the Old Ancestor entered the city for a period of time.When they arrived, it was already late at night. Hence, after some hesitation and weighing the pros and cons, they didn't choose to enter the depths. Instead, they hid at the edge and waited.It was just that there were too many mutated beasts and bizarre existences in the city and their hiding place wasn't a relatively safe shelter that they could find, so it was inevitable that they would encounter them.Because they didn't want to cause too much commotion and attract even more mutated beasts, the two of them avoided as much as they could. They only attacked when they really couldn't avoid it.Their cautious behavior, in addition to their extraordinary strength, made it so that even if they were attacked now, they would still be able to deal with it.At that moment, just as they were about to shake off the mutated beasts behind them, a cold light instantly shot over from afar.His speed was so fast that he was like an arrow released from a bow in the dark night. He whistled as he charged toward the Diamond Sect elder in front of him.This person wasn't the one who had fought against Xu Qing earlier. He was a latecomer who had followed the Diamond Sect's ancestor.His expression immediately changed and he performed a series of hand seals with both hands before pushing forward. Immediately, the surrounding ice rumbled and spread out. His body also had a protective barrier that solidified, blocking the incoming cold light.However, the might of this cold light was astonishing. It instantly penetrated the ice and directly pierced through his defense.As the spirit energy fluctuations trembled intensely, traces of cracks appeared on his protective barrier. However, he still managed to block it in the end. This also allowed him to clearly see that what attacked him was a black-colored iron stick! n(ovelbin[.]nEt This scene caused the eyes of this Diamond Sect elder to narrow. He abruptly turned his head to look at his companion behind him and was about to take action but it was still too late.The instant he was attacked, a black shadow had already transformed into a bolt of black lightning from the alley beside him, instantly approaching the other elder behind this person.This black shadow was Xu Qing.The iron stick from before was a cover-up. The first target Xu Qing wanted to deal with was the middle-aged man whom he had fought against before and whose left leg was destroyed by him!At that moment, Xu Qing's speed completely erupted. He was much faster than when he was at the sixth level of the Mountains and Seas Art. As he sped, he created a sharp wind sound and instantly arrived beside the injured middle-aged cultivator.This middle-aged cultivator was injured and the anomalous substances in the forbidden zone were very dense. As such, he couldn't continue using the flight talisman to fly. As such, when he compared himself to his companions, his footsteps were a little unsteady.At that moment, in the face of danger, his eyes widened and an intense sense of life-and-death crisis rose in his heart. His body abruptly retreated, wanting to dodge but how could Xu Qing give him a chance? The instant he got close, his body instantly leaped up and his right hand clenched into a fist as he punched out ruthlessly.Regardless of speed or strength, Xu Qing used his full strength in this punch.At that moment, when he struck out, a malevolent kui shadow appeared behind him. When it let out a soundless roar that shook the surroundings, it gathered in Xu Qing's fist.At the instant the punch was thrown out, the air seemed as though it was about to explode. As waves of cracking sounds rang out, it seemed to contain a suppressive force as it landed on the middle-aged cultivator's chest amidst the ferocity of his shadow.The protective barrier in front of the middle-aged cultivator instantly shattered. Xu Qing's fist then smashed into his chest like a hot knife through butter.An earth-shattering boom suddenly reverberated through the silent city.Accompanied by a blood-curdling screech, the middle-aged cultivator who had lost his left foot spurted out a mouthful of blood as his chest caved in deeply. His internal organs were about to collapse and shatter at this moment and his figure was like a kite with a broken string, tumbling uncontrollably.However, he was still at the ninth level of Qi Condensation after all. At that moment, his expression was one of terror as he forcefully suppressed his injuries. The flight rune on his right leg suddenly flashed and the power of flight spread out, causing his falling body to twist as he tried to escape.However, at the next instant, a cold light flashed again as a longsword whistled over. It instantly got close and sliced through his right leg.Fresh blood spurted out as a mournful cry echoed in all directions. His right leg, which was stuck to the flying talisman, was instantly severed from his body.However, before the person who lost his right leg landed, Xu Qing exerted strength in his thigh and charged out once again. The instant he charged out, the ground he was on earlier was penetrated by a large number of ice blades formed by another person's spell.As they passed each other, Xu Qing didn't even glance behind him. He directly caught up to the falling middle-aged cultivator in the air. In his despair, his right hand punched out.The Kui shadow roared and fused into his fist, pouncing ferociously toward the middle-aged cultivator.It directly struck the person's forehead.With a bang, the middle-aged cultivator's body trembled violently and his head exploded. Fresh blood splattered everywhere as he died!When the corpse landed on the ground, the mutated beasts that were chasing pounced on it and tore it apart.Xu Qing's body didn't stop at all. He tore off the flight talisman on his broken leg and turned to look at the pale-faced Diamond Sect elder not far away.After licking his lips, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's wolf-like eyes as he quickly rushed toward the elder.Kill!

Chapter ﻿69 Cause And Effect (1)
As the tragic death of the middle-aged cultivator echoed in the air, the Diamond Sect's ancestor who was searching for Xu Qing in the city suddenly lifted his head.As a Foundation Building cultivator, his five senses were extremely sharp. At that moment, when he heard the miserable cry in the distance, his expression instantly darkened. He leaped into the air and flew toward the source of the sound.Although there were mutated beasts in the surroundings, he was a Foundation Establishment expert after all. As long as he didn't encounter strange existences or a large group of mutated beasts, he didn't care.Even though the dense anomalous substances affected him, with his cultivation, as long as he didn't stay in the forbidden zone for more than a month, it wouldn't cause too much trouble.Therefore, after confirming the direction, the Diamond Sect's ancestor roared and used the power of his cultivation to transmit his voice further."Hold that brat back and wait for me!"As he spoke, his figure in the air erupted with speed. From afar, he looked like a shooting star whistling through the air.At the same time, on the battlefield earlier, another Sect elder retreated without hesitation the instant Xu Qing got close.He heard the ancestor's roar but he didn't want to die pointlessly here. Even if he was punished by the Old Ancestor afterwards, he would still accept it. After all, Xu Qing's murderous aura was too strong. When he attacked ruthlessly, the killing intent in his eyes made him unwilling to take the risk.Hence, his speed of retreat was extremely fast at that moment. He even used his flying talisman and instantly retreated several thousand feet.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He also heard the low roar of the Sect's ancestor coming from a very far distance. However, he didn't stop and chased after him fiercely. On the way, he picked up his iron stick and was about to use the flying talisman as well. However, in the next instant, his expression suddenly changed. His breathing paused for a moment before he turned around without hesitation and sped in the opposite direction.The instant Xu Qing turned around, the expression of the Sect's elder who was flying in the air instantly turned into one of horror. He felt a wave of coldness gushing toward him, and he also noticed a gigantic figure that had appeared beside him.That figure had no facial features. One could only see a head of long hair fluttering in the wind. It seemed to be a woman and the figure beneath the face was incomparably huge. She wore a long white dress.At that moment, a large number of faces appeared densely on the faceless woman's long dress. Waves of mournful cries instantly spread in all directions and endless strangeness pervaded the surroundings. Even the moon in the sky directly turned blood-colored.From afar, the figure of the Sect's elder was like an ant in front of the giant. It was insignificant. Under the countless crying faces of the faceless woman in the white dress, the Sect's elder's body trembled violently. His expression changed and he started crying slowly.However, amidst the crying, his eyes revealed extreme fear. It was as though his crying was uncontrollable.This lasted until the crying sound merged with the countless crying faces on the body of the faceless woman in the white dress. After that, waves of white aura spread out from the seven orifices of the Sect's elder and rapidly entered the body of the faceless woman in the white dress. At the next moment…The Diamond Sect's elder's body directly turned into a dried corpse and he lost all signs of life as he fell to the ground. At the same time, another face appeared on the faceless woman in the white dress. It was none other than the Diamond Sect elder.His face was expressionless as he floated above the white dress and let out a cry.This scene was seen by Xu Qing and also by the Diamond Sect's ancestor who had rushed over at this moment. Both of their bodies trembled.Xu Qing took a deep breath and suppressed the shock in his heart. He then increased his speed and sped into the city.It was just that although Xu Qing could leave, the Sect's ancestor, who was rushing over from afar, felt his scalp go numb and didn't dare to move at all.This was because the faceless woman in the white dress was walking toward him.The Diamond Sect's ancestor was very clear that in the face of such an existence, he couldn't move rapidly. Otherwise, he would suffer the same fate as his own elder. Hence, amidst his terror and trepidation, the white-clothed faceless woman passed by him and gradually moved away.Only now did the Sect's ancestor heave a sigh of relief. However, for some reason, a trace of doubt appeared in his heart."I encountered this bizarre existence twice already… Why do I have a feeling that it seems to be helping that brat…""Strange!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor gritted his teeth and looked in the direction Xu Qing had left in. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he had to get rid of the other party. At that moment, he rushed out rapidly in pursuit.In the dark night, all kinds of roars rose and fell, echoing in every corner of the city. The sounds of chewing, crying and cold laughter spread in all directions.Under the moonlight, there were broken walls everywhere, as though they had turned into demons. This caused the strange feeling in the city to become increasingly intense.Xu Qing, who was speeding inside, had long been familiar with the roars and strangeness of this place. However, his countenance was still pale. He felt as though he was being stared at by countless malicious gazes and those gazes turned icy cold, as though they were invading his body.When his entire body felt increasingly cold, Xu Qing passed by the place where he had hunted the vultures that day. When his gaze swept over it, his eyes instantly narrowed…Not far away, next to the abandoned carriage that had sunk into the mud, the blood-colored ragdoll that should have been hanging on the carriage's shaft had changed its position. It wasn't hanging there but was placed on the carriage with its back facing Xu Qing, so its front couldn't be seen.Xu Qing's scalp tightened and he quickly left this place.Not long later, the Sect's ancestor arrived at the place. When he swept his vigilant gaze across the surroundings, he saw the carriage and also the blood-colored puppet sitting on the carriage that was facing him.The eyes of this puppet were dim and its entire body was wet and red. It looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor sinisterly.

Chapter ﻿70 Cause And Effect (2)
The pupils of the Diamond Sect's ancestor contracted slightly and goosebumps rose in his heart. His footsteps instantly slowed down as he cautiously left this area step by step. Only then did he heave a sigh of relief and speed up again.However, he didn't pursue or get too close. He had already realized how strange this youth was. At the same time, he knew that the other party had a method to cause the anomalous substances to instantly thicken. Hence, he didn't plan to get too close and forcefully attack. Instead, he planned to rely on his cultivation base to keep an eye on the other party and wait for daybreak before attacking.Although he was a Foundation Building cultivator and had to be so careful when dealing with a Qi Condensation cultivator, this matter would damage his reputation as a Foundation Building cultivator. However, under such circumstances, the Sect's ancestor still decided to prioritize safety first.Hence, he slowed down and followed behind at a moderate pace.Xu Qing, who was at the front, also noticed this. He had originally simulated a counterattack method in his heart and he had also completed the preliminary preparations for shadow control. He also held the black pill in his hand, waiting for the other party to get close.He was confident that even though the other party wouldn't be killed by his methods, he would still be in a sorry state and wouldn't be able to escape for a short period of time. Also, although he would also be heavily injured by the other party, escaping after being heavily injured would be more realistic. It wouldn't be easy for him to arouse suspicion and make it easier for him to plan his next step of attraction.However, this old ancestor of the Diamond Sect was still so cautious despite being in the Foundation Establishment Realm. This made Xu Qing even more vigilant. However, although the other party didn't get close, Xu Qing felt that he still had to carry out his plan. Hence, he sped up and headed straight for the city lord's residence.Closer and closer.The location of the city lord's residence was at the center of the city. The anomalous substances here were denser than in other places but for some reason, the number of mutated beasts here was decreasing.This change caused the expression of the Sect's ancestor, who was chasing after them, to change slightly. The sense of danger in his heart was very intense at this moment.He lifted his head and looked at Xu Qing's back view before looking at the collapsed building at the side. His footsteps suddenly paused.He didn't continue to chase but started to retreat.This scene was something Xu Qing didn't expect. At this moment, he was still 1000 feet away from the city lord's residence but the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who was chasing after him, wanted to retreat."It's still a little too late to retreat now!" Xu Qing gritted his teeth fiercely. He suddenly lifted his right hand and waved it fiercely, causing a large number of black pills to scatter in all directions.This time, to achieve his goal, Xu Qing directly used half of the black pills he had left. At this moment, they landed in the surroundings and exploded simultaneously!In that instant, this place seemed to have transformed into a gigantic vortex, causing the anomalous substances in all directions to surge over, affecting the void and distorting the surroundings, causing everything in sight to turn blurry.The density of anomalous substances had reached an astonishing level.This scene caused the expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who was currently retreating, to change. However, he was even more puzzled because Xu Qing's body was also within the dense anomalous substances.  n(ovelbin[.]nEt If this continued, putting aside the problem of mutation, just the mutated beasts and bizarre creatures that were attracted by the anomalous substances would cause Xu Qing to die without a burial ground. This was equivalent to suicide.Just as the Sect's ancestor was struggling, the city lord's residence, which was a thousand feet away, suddenly trembled intensely. A series of earth-shattering and terrifying roars spread in all directions, abruptly spreading in all directions.The earth trembled and the blood moon in the sky turned blurry.The expression of the Sect's ancestor changed and the feeling of a life-and-death crisis instantly intensified. His pupils constricted and his body retreated rapidly. His eyes stared fixedly ahead as numerous figures flew out from a building that looked like a city lord's residence!These figures were all incomparably skinny but they had black flaming wings. The density of anomalous substances on their bodies was astonishing and wherever they passed, the void seemed to distort.This scene caused the Sect's ancestor to be even more alarmed. What made his countenance turn even paler as he gasped was that as the explosion rang out, the city lord's residence collapsed, revealing a gigantic hole in the ground.A withered figure that was a thousand feet tall crawled out of the cave with a roar that shook the sky!From afar, this figure was slender like a withered tree. The exposed part was already a thousand feet long but at that moment, it was obvious that it hadn't completely crawled out. It seemed to only have the upper body.Hence, it waved its arms and a large number of rotting vines instantly extended from its ten fingers, shooting out in all directions and piercing into the ground.The furthest ones even pierced into the ground in front of the Diamond Sect's ancestor.As though using this as a support, the gigantic withered tree-like figure sped up and climbed out."What the hell is this!!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor's heart trembled wildly as he cursed in horror. His expression changed drastically like never before as he erupted with all his speed and retreated frantically.However, what made him even more frenzied was the sight of those winged figures who were attracted by the anomalous substances and rushed out. After they rushed out of the city lord's residence, their target was the area with the concentrated anomalous substances formed by the kid using unknown means.However, for some reason, after these winged figures rushed into that area, they quickly crawled out and roared as they looked around. After that, they locked onto him and flew over."What's going on!! Where is the kid!!"All of this caused the Sect's ancestor's eyes to widen. Even though his speed was astonishing, he was still caught up to very quickly. Amidst the rumbling sounds, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was forced to make a move and he had no choice but to erupt in full force.Only then did those winged figures collapse. However, the strange thing was that they recovered in an instant and continued to pounce over. In the distance, in the huge cave where the city lord's residence was located, that terrifying existence was about to crawl out completely.
