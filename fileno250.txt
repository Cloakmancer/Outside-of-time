The First Peak's youth was stunned.He felt that his literary attainments weren't bad and he could casually speak in poems. However, he was still a little confused by the content of the jade slip, so he studied it word by word.However, he was still a little confused. After another careful analysis, he was stunned."Give birth to an heir? How? Why must it be qing <anno data-annotation-id="52cbe61a-a0a9-48cd-bf84-cf812bb82009">e</anno>? Qing e means women, right?"After a while, he looked at the small bottle. He suddenly thought of something and his eyes widened."Could it be‚Ä¶" He started to feel uncomfortable when he recalled that he had smelled it earlier. He gritted his teeth and muttered."This is too much!!" He instinctively wanted to throw it away but he couldn't bear to. He reassured himself that this might be considered half of the ancient king's bloodline. Hence, he felt very conflicted when he held it in his hand and wondered if men couldn't do it.At the same time, Xu Qing opened his eyes on the magic ship in the distance and looked at the First Peak's youth on the large sword behind him. He guessed that the other party should have opened that wish box and was also curious."What did you get?" Xu Qing asked.The barrier around the large sword dissipated and revealed the First Peak's youth. His expression was unsightly and he kept spewing out air as though he was cleaning his nose.He even gushed his magic power into his nostrils. It was only after a long time that his expression improved a little. He looked at the sky and didn't speak. As for the wish box, he had already stored it.Seeing this, Xu Qing made a guess. He retracted his gaze and didn't bother anymore.Time flowed again. The two of them were getting closer and closer to the Seven Blood Eyes, and Xu Qing also gained some understanding of that feather magic artifact.The ability of this item was speed.Once it was activated, it could allow the cultivator's speed to instantly erupt to several times that of their own. However, the requirement for the body was very high.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ Because there was an outsider around, Xu Qing didn't test it right away. However, after sensing it, he was already certain that once this magic artifact was activated, his speed would reach an astonishing height."I need to find a place to give it a try and familiarize myself with its usage." As Xu Qing pondered, he noticed a magic boat from the Seventh Peak in the distance.Almost the instant the Seventh Peak's magic boat appeared, the First Peak's youth, who had become bored since he opened the wish box, instantly raised his head and snapped his fingers. A new Daoist robe appeared on his body.His movements were very familiar, as though he had practiced this many times. His expression also revealed coldness, as though it had turned into ice.There was also a faintly lingering sword qi on his body. It looked like he was on guard and also looked like it was done intentionally. This was more obvious when the sword qi surrounded him, causing his long hair to flutter. When outsiders saw it, they would think he was extraordinary.It was only when the Seventh Peak's magic boat left that the First Peak's youth became dispirited again.This action, especially the way he changed his clothes and the speed, made Xu Qing feel a little strange. However, as time passed, they encountered more Seven Blood Eyes disciples on the way. Moreover, Xu Qing gradually got used to it as the other party did this every time. The Diamond Sect's ancestor seized the opportunity and transmitted his voice to Xu Qing."Master, this kid is clearly someone who pays special attention to his image. I think it's fine if we don't kill such a person. We can make use of his personality and make him work for us.""For example, at critical moments, Master, you can praise him a little. According to the descriptions in the ancient books I read, such people are often the kind of people who can bleed for their reputation.""Also, I guessed earlier that he values his reputation very much, so I've already cast a spell and imprinted all his sorry appearances on the way. I've also saved the scenes of him speaking normally. Regardless of whether it's useful or not, at least this is a method to exploit his personality.""Also, if there's a chance in the future, Master can create some situations that will embarrass this person even more. For example, making him beg for mercy, placing him in filth, and so on. I'll store his images behind in case we need it."The Diamond Sect's ancestor spoke quickly. He didn't say a word about how useful he could be, but after listening to it, it revealed his value."Master, please punish me for my slow reaction. To Master, these small matters can be thought of instantly. However, I only thought of these after thinking about it for a long time. Master, please punish me. I'm too stupid and my talent is inferior to Master's.""Master, please give me another chance. I'll definitely work hard and deal with all these trivial matters for you in the future. Leave these dirty and tiring work to me. You Lingzi will definitely do his best to not let Master down!"Xu Qing glanced at the black iron stick beside him and calmly spoke."Three months are almost up. I'll give you an additional month. Shadow, your time is still the same."The Diamond Sect's ancestor was immediately excited. After that, he pretended to casually glance at the shadow. As for the shadow, it trembled and quickly spread out. It then entered the sea and crazily absorbed the anomalous substances.Xu Qing glanced at them but didn't bother. He closed his eyes and meditated on Life Art.Time flowed by and the Seven Blood Eyes' harbor was in sight in the distance. As they encountered more boats and ships, the First Peak's youth seemed to have put down his worries. His eyes clearly revealed determination as he stood up, maintaining his aloof posture at all times.He didn't seem as worried about Xu Qing's cold gaze as before. He even sized up Xu Qing a few times and calmly spoke."A cloud in front of the City God Temple, cultivators die quickly."When Xu Qing heard this, he touched the black iron stick at the side. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was also tactful and released a ferocious intent to lock onto the First Peak's youth.The First Peak's youth coughed. He knew that the other party didn't understand his words and he wasn't willing to explain. He took out a jade slip and imprinted it. He then threw it to Xu Qing as though everything he wanted to say was inside.Xu Qing frowned. After he caught the jade slip, the information about the other party's imprint appeared in his mind."Brother, we can be considered to have an affinity. I'm the ninth highness of the First Peak, Wu Jianwu. We became acquainted after a fight and we're from the same sect. I think your murderous aura is too strong. We don't have to fight to the death.""Moreover, it's not good to have too much baleful aura outside. I heard that back then, after the Third Peak's core disciple, Senior Brother Chen, advanced, he went missing because his baleful aura was too strong. Now, many years have passed but we have yet to find the murderer.""Also, the only son of the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord was also as murderous as you. He also disappeared.""So, I advise you to conduct yourself well."The First Peak's young man, Wu Jianwu, stood on the large sword and glanced at Xu Qing. The instant Xu Qing looked at the jade slip, he rushed out. His entire body emitted a monstrous blood light and he transformed into a rainbow that shot into the sky. A large sword also manifested under his feet.His entire person looked extraordinary and he instantly got far from Xu Qing's magic ship. He flew straight for the First Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes."I have transcended the mundane world, and became an immortal by swallowing the sea of clouds."When he flew over, he let out a clear voice that echoed in all directions, attracting the attention of many people.In their eyes, this heaven's chosen of the First Peak, who was dressed in a crimson Daoist robe and whose long hair fluttered in the wind, looked like an immortal.Xu Qing cast a cold glance. He didn't care about the other party's little trick. In reality, the closer he was to the sect, the less he would act like before.He retracted his gaze and controlled the magic ship to head straight for the Seven Blood Eyes' port. The moment he got close, the life-linking talisman mark on his body emitted a gentle light before quickly dissipating.After he completely stepped into the harbor of the Seven Blood Eyes, all the runes on his body disappeared.Xu Qing's body relaxed. He then glanced at Wu Jianwu, who had already flown to the First Peak. He put away the magic ship and soared into the air, flying toward the Seventh Peak. Very soon, he entered the Seventh Peak and returned to his cave abode.After arriving at the entrance of the cave abode, Xu Qing sensed his surroundings and confirmed that everything he had arranged before leaving was normal. Only then did he open the cave abode's entrance and enter. As the door closed, Xu Qing sat down."I need to see how many spirit stones I need to open the port. Also, it's indeed inconvenient to stay on the mountain. It's more comfortable to stay on the magic ship."After Xu Qing pondered, he looked at the purple Daoist robe he was wearing and thought of Zhang San and the captain's gray Daoist robe. He then made some decisions.He turned his head and looked at the jade plate at the center of the cave abode. Ever since he entered the cave abode, it had been emitting a weak light.This central jade plate was the core of the cave abode's array formation. The replacement spirit stones were also here. It also had a recording function.Xu Qing walked over and pressed down on the central jade plate. Immediately, streams of information appeared in his mind. It recorded the people who had requested to see him during this period of time.Among them, Huang Yan requested once, Zhou Qingpeng requested once, Ding Xue requested three times, and Gu Muqing requested two times. However, there were two who had come to check the most number of times.One was the director of the Homicide Department. He had made 23 requests, and the other was a member of Team Six of the Homicide Department. The name he reported was Mute.There were a total of 41 records of him requesting to see him.He basically requested every day.Xu Qing looked at these records and thought of how he had casually saved the mute back then. Clearly, the other party's life was very tenacious and had survived.Just as Xu Qing was checking, the jade plate suddenly shone again. There was another record, and it was from the mute.To the disciples on the mountain, outsiders had to obtain their permission to visit, especially the piedmont disciple. After some thought, Xu Qing agreed to the request.Not long later, a small and skinny figure followed the guidance of the array formation and arrived in front of Xu Qing's cave abode. Xu Qing walked out as the door of the cave abode opened."What's the matter?" Xu Qing looked at the little mute who was standing there awkwardly, not daring to get close.The other party's clothes were as old as ever and the injuries on his body had long recovered. Moreover, his entire person had a colder aura. Clearly, he had grown a lot from that life-and-death situation.Under Xu Qing's gaze, the mute's body trembled. He took out a token and respectfully placed it to the side. After that, he took a few steps back and lifted his small face to look at Xu Qing. He suddenly knelt down and kowtowed a few times.Only when his forehead was bleeding did he stand up and quickly run down the mountain.Xu Qing watched as the other party left. He then lifted his right hand and made a grabbing gesture; the token on the ground flew over. This item wasn't an identity mark but a storage token.Xu Qing, who was very familiar with the port, naturally knew what this was.Half of the Seven Blood Eyes' ports was used by the Seventh Peak's disciples, and the other half was for the outside world. There were many boats and ships from various races that usually came and went, and pirate ships were also mixed up in them.As for these foreign boats, they couldn't be stored like the Seven Blood Eyes' magic boats. Therefore, they needed to be berthed and stored. This token was the authenticating item to take them back.To the Seven Blood Eyes, they only verified the tokens when someone came to take the boats.Clearly, after the little mute experienced the matter of sending the wanted criminal's corpse last time, he thought that Xu Qing didn't like wanted criminals. Hence, he killed countless people this time and obtained such a token for Xu Qing.This time around, Xu Qing accepted it.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="52cbe61a-a0a9-48cd-bf84-cf812bb82009">The slip uses an ancient style of writing.</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 222 Gray Robe Enters The Society
The next day, Xu Qing went to the location of the token. There was a small merchant ship there. The items inside were not bad. Although they weren't very valuable, they still had some value. Most importantly, Xu Qing saw a pile of medicinal herbs inside.According to the careful answer of the disciple in charge of this place, Xu Qing knew that no one had come to collect this ship for two months.Xu Qing kept the medicinal herbs and called his informant over to deal with the merchant ship. After that, he asked about the opening of the port."Master, I've understood everything about the opening of the port and was about to report it to you.""The newly opened port is divided into internal and external businesses. Each has its pros and cons. There aren't many benefits for internal businesses but it's convenient for Master to build connections with the piedmont disciples.""As for setting the port for external businesses, the benefits are extremely great. However, this requires many department branches to settle down. For example, Pilotage, Dispatch, Transportation, and so on. However, once it's built, even if it's just a simple port, the benefits will be astonishing as merchant ships come and go. In addition, it will also attract shops to settle down. This is another benefit."The informant spoke in a low voice. She didn't dare to slack off at all when it came to the mission Xu Qing had given her. In the past two months, she had been constantly investigating and researching. She had even spent some spirit coins to buy a lot of information.Hence, after Xu Qing asked, she didn't think about it for too long and told him everything about opening a new port."However, the project is huge. Even though it's only the simplest port, the initial infrastructure still requires at least three million spirit stones. If it's completed together with the shops and other facilities, the total investment will be above ten million. Moreover, there's no cap on it according to the requirements."When Xu Qing heard this, his expression showed no change but his mind shook. He originally thought that he could be considered rich now. After all, the storage bag of the Sea Corpse Race contained hundreds of thousands of spirit stones.However, when he heard the informant's words, Xu Qing could only remain silent."However, the final benefits are terrifying. There is a limit to how many boats our Seven Blood Eyes' harbor can handle. During this period of time, I've been observing the boats coming and going. 30% of the boats that come to the Seven Blood Eyes have to queue outside to enter every day.""Therefore, once our new port is established, there will be no lack of merchant ships coming and going. After comparing the other ports, I calculated that the initial investment will be about three million spirit stones. You can use the profits to slowly build more facilities in the future.""If everything goes smoothly, you'll be able to break even in about two years at most. After that, you'll be able to earn back your capital in the third year. In the future, your annual income should be around three million spirit stones.""I also heard that among the other Foundation Building seniors who opened ports, very few of them will fully invest by themselves. They do it with others. So, if Master has someone willing, you can invest together. However, it seems that they must also be Foundation Building seniors.""In addition, many of the sect's money <anno data-annotation-id="f55a33b1-77fa-4769-a3fe-a706fbfb7a65">shops</anno> are also passionate about this. However, I heard that the sect has many restrictions on this, so not many ports are willing to get involved with them."Xu Qing fell silent.Originally, he felt that the opportunity to open a port couldn't be wasted. Moreover, once it was built, he wouldn't have to do anything and would be able to gain such a large sum of profit every year. Hence, he asked his informant to inquire.However, now that he heard of all the details, although Xu Qing was tempted, it was too expensive. Moreover, it was obvious that there were many troublesome things involved.In addition, if he invested so many spirit stones, he would tie himself too deeply to the Seven Blood Eyes. Xu Qing was a little hesitant about this. He suddenly understood why many Foundation Building cultivators didn't choose to open a port.On one hand, they would be creating a shackle for themselves. On the other hand, the expenditure was huge.With these spirit stones, Xu Qing felt that he could issue missions and get others to capture sea beasts for him.Xu Qing already had the thought of giving up.He let the informant leave. He then changed into a gray Daoist robe and prepared to trade the materials.On this return, he wanted to buy a lot of things, be it medicinal herbs or talismans. In addition, he planned to take a look at the magic artifacts sold in the sect.Magic artifacts were very expensive and Xu Qing couldn't bear to spend his spirit stones on them previously. Now that he had a lot of money, he planned to choose one.He was also very interested in the soul slips that First Peak's Wu Jianwu had thrown out. He would see if they were sold. Although the efficiency of this item was average, it was very convenient to absorb the souls."There's also the Spirit Breath Lantern‚Ä¶" Xu Qing pondered as he walked on the streets. Under the cover of his gray Daoist robe and the concealment of his cultivation, he looked like an ordinary disciple. Only occasionally would one or two gazes sweep over him from the crowd.The people who swept over were all Foundation Building cultivators who wore gray Daoist robes like Xu Qing. When they sensed each other's auras, they would often look away immediately and not disturb each other.Just like that, Xu Qing arrived at the breakfast stall he used to go to every day. He sat down and ate a beautiful meal under the enthusiastic greeting of the stall owner.This time, he ate four eggs.Although he could skip meals for several days after he stepped into Foundation Building and nourish himself with magic power, Xu Qing still liked to eat like before. This gave him a sense of satisfaction.As he ate, he took out his identity token and transmitted his voice to Huang Yan, asking him about the follow-up to the matter of him wanting to buy the Spirit Breath Lantern.Huang Yan didn't reply immediately. It was only when Xu Qing was about to leave after eating that he received a message from Huang Yan."I'm buying it. Xu Qing, you're back? Where are you? I'll look for you."Looking at Huang Yan's reply, Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. He was in a very good mood when he thought about how he was going to earn 500,000 spirit stones. After telling the other party the location, Xu Qing soon saw Huang Yan running over in a hurry.He seemed to have gained even more weight. The circles of flesh on his body had increased by several layers. Upon seeing Xu Qing, Huang Yan laughed and directly threw out a thick bundle of spirit tickets.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ "All of them have face value of 1,000 spirit stones and are the exclusive spirit tickets of the Sixth Peak. There are a total of 200 tickets.""There was not much time, so I was only able to get these spirit stones here. How about I use a magic artifact to offset the rest?" As Huang Yan spoke, he took out a black inner armor and handed it to Xu Qing."Magic artifact?" Xu Qing took the inner armor. After magic power gushed in, he immediately sensed that the inner armor was filled with countless runes, arranged according to a certain pattern. At a rough glance, there were probably no less than 100,000 of them. With just a slight sense, Xu Qing could sense that this inner armor was extraordinary."This is a Myriad Rune Armor. I originally planned to give it to Senior Sister, but I think she prefers the Spirit Breath Lantern. I'll exchange this armor with you. You can sell it for about 300,000 spirit stones.""Although this thing is only a low-ranked magic artifact, its defense is not bad. If you wear it and encounter a Foundation Building cultivator in Mystic Brilliance Form, as long as the other party hasn't formed a second ball of fire, the armor will be able to block their attacks several times."Huang Yan seemed to know a lot about Foundation Building. Clearly, his senior sister had taught him many things and his cultivation level had also reached the point where he was about to break through.Xu Qing nodded. After he kept the Myriad Rune Armor, he took out the Spirit Breath Lantern and passed it to Huang Yan."Do you need me to send you to the Seventh Peak?" Xu Qing looked at Huang Yan, who was playing with the Spirit Breath Lantern, and asked softly."There's no need. Who dares to snatch what I want to give Senior Sister?" Huang Yan patted his stomach and happily kept the Spirit Breath Lantern. Just as he was about to take out a jade slip and transmit his voice to Senior Sister, he suddenly thought of something and turned his head to glance at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, the matter of the war that I told you about last time has basically been confirmed. You can consider whether you want to participate or not." With that, he waved at Xu Qing and quickly ran toward the Seventh Peak.Looking at Huang Yan's departing figure, Xu Qing sighed inwardly at how rich Huang Yan was. He could take out hundreds of thousands of spirit stones and magic artifacts just like that. However, Xu Qing didn't investigate Huang Yan's background.This was a taboo in the Seven Blood Eyes and Xu Qing wasn't willing to do it.He thought of what Huang Yan had said earlier."War‚Ä¶"The last remaining thought of opening a port was also erased at this moment. He was prepared to use the right to obtain an ownership of a street.Although the benefits weren't much, it was still better than nothing.With this thought in mind, Xu Qing walked toward the shops that sold jade talismans.Most of the shops that sold items for Foundation Building cultivators in the main city were in the Sixth Peak's Pengming District. There weren't many shops in the port area and because the prices were extremely high, there were very few customers in such shops.Most of them had separate compartments to entertain the guests.After arriving at the Pengming District, Xu Qing searched for a while. In the end, he chose a shop called Bright Artifact Pavilion and walked in.This shop could be considered one of the largest shops in the entire Sixth Peak's Pengming District. It had a total of five floors and the area of each floor was about 2,000 feet.The interior was even more luxurious. It seemed like they usually received a lot of customers, so there were many handsome and beautiful staff members. As soon as Xu Qing stepped in, he immediately attracted the attention of many of the shop assistants. Although Xu Qing was wearing a gray Daoist robe, his appearance was extremely outstanding. In fact, in the eyes of the young female shop assistants, Xu Qing's arrival seemed to cause the shop to light up for a moment.Not to mention that the people who dared to step into their shop were no ordinary people. At the very least, they were all core disciples. Moreover, they had entertained many Foundation Building cultivators, so they knew very well that most Foundation Building cultivators in the sect liked to move in gray robes.Many of the staff quickly walked over to receive him. However, one of them, a beautiful young girl with a double ponytail, was the first to arrive in front of Xu Qing before everyone else."Senior Brother, you can call me Xiaohui. I'll do my best to serve you." The young girl looked at Xu Qing's face and blushed slightly as she spoke."Our Bright Artifact Pavilion mainly sells tools. The first floor sells talismans, the second floor is jade talismans, and the third floor is magic artifacts. Senior Brother, what do you want to check? I'll guide you."Xu Qing swept his gaze across the surroundings and noticed that there were no other customers on the first floor of the shop other than him. He also saw that the walls here were filled with all kinds of talismans.Although they were all sealed, there were still powerful fluctuations spreading out.And the energy fluctuations from the talismans in the dozens of crystal pillars in the hall were even more obvious.Based on the fact that they were stored separately, their quality should be much better."I want to check magic artifacts." Xu Qing retracted his gaze and looked at the young girl whose face was becoming increasingly rosy.When the pigtailed girl heard this, her eyes lit up even more.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="f55a33b1-77fa-4769-a3fe-a706fbfb7a65">A type of old private bank</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 223 War Opportunity
"The magic artifacts are on the third floor. This way, senior!"Upon hearing that Xu Qing wanted to buy a magic artifact, this young girl who had received many Foundation Building cultivators from the sect immediately knew that this extremely good-looking peer in front of her was definitely at the Foundation Building realm.This caused her heart to shake and the way she addressed him changed. Her eyes became even more bright as she led the way respectfully.At the same time, at the staircase, she played a small maneuver. She didn't ask Xu Qing to go first but took the initiative to step forward and guide the way.This wasn't rude. Moreover, as she walked up the steps, her curves were inadvertently revealed. In particular, her perky butt was even more obvious, puffing up her robe and outlining the shape of a peach.It was filled with seduction. As her pigtails swayed, it also added a hint of innocence.Unfortunately, Xu Qing ignored it.After reaching the third floor, the young girl felt a little depressed. She didn't sense any difference in Xu Qing's expression, but she quickly organized her thoughts. After she led Xu Qing to a compartment, she respectfully asked about Xu Qing's requirements."Attack type, and the price has to be around 300,000 spirit stones!" Xu Qing calmly spoke.When the young girl heard this, she nodded and left. Not long later, she returned with a tray that contained three items.One was a small blue sword with a talisman pasted on it, sealing 99% of the sword's aura. Only a trace of it could be sensed.The second item was a necklace with five fingernail-sized black pearls embedded on it. It was also sealed by a talisman.The last item was a small red bell."Cold Mountain Sword. This sword contains the aura of the Forbidden Sea. During the forging process, it was placed at the bottom of the sea for three years, causing its cold intent to be astonishing. It can be controlled by magic power to emit cold air. It is good at speed and is very sharp.""Five Fiend Beads. Every bead is sealed with a strand of goldfiend aura. Once it's released, it can transform into metal lightning punishment that can kill everything. Unless it's exhausted, it won't stop. The method is to infuse magic power and engrave the target's name on the bead.""The last one is Living Soul Bell. Once it is shaken, it can cause the enemy's soul to tremble and be locked in place. However, it is ineffective against bizarre entities and is only useful against cultivators with physical bodies. Moreover, this artifact has flaws. Once it is activated, the user will also be affected if they have a physical body. However, because it is a rare soul-type magic artifact, the price is even higher.""Cold Mountain Sword, 270,000 spirit stones, Five Fiend Beads, 300,000 spirits, and Living Soul Bell, 330,000 spirit stones." The young girl spoke crisply and then looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's gaze swept past these three items. On the surface, he looked normal, but inwardly, he was sighing at how expensive magic artifacts were. However, he knew that before he activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, magic artifacts would be very important for him.Moreover, since war was coming, he naturally had to make proper preparations. Otherwise, once the news of the war spread, the items would probably be even more expensive.He liked all of these three magic artifacts. However, he couldn't afford them all.He had to buy jade talismans and a large number of poisonous grass items.Hence, after checking them one by one, Xu Qing finally gritted his teeth and bought the Living Soul Bell. Although this item had a flaw, Xu Qing had a way to resolve it.He would tie it to the black iron stick and let the Diamond Sect's ancestor use it to kill enemies from afar. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was an artifact spirit and not a soul with a physical body, so he wouldn't be affected."This is it." Xu Qing held the Living Soul Bell and slowly spoke.The young girl was a little excited. After all, the sale of magic artifacts was a big business. She respectfully handled the transaction for Xu Qing and followed Xu Qing's request to bring him to the second floor to check the jade talismans. Here, Xu Qing bought three jade talismans that increased defense and an attack-type jade talisman, spending another 120,000 spirit stones.When he walked out of the shop, Xu Qing touched his pocket and sighed inwardly.When he was in the Qi Condensation realm, he felt that the resources needed for Qi Condensation cultivators were very expensive. When he reached the Foundation Building realm, he felt that the expenses in Qi Condensation were okay, and the Foundation Building pills were the most expensive. However, now he felt that those were nothing. Foundation Building jade talismans and magic artifacts were the most expensive."I need a large number of spirit stones to upgrade the magic boat as well‚Ä¶"Xu Qing shook his head. After buying the magic artifact, he suppressed his heartache and prepared to head to the Chengling District of the Second Peak to take a look at the medicinal herbs. After all, compared to the Chengling District, the types of medicinal herbs in the port areas were inferior.He also wanted to see if he could buy Ghost Desires and ammonites. This concerned his method to attract sea beasts to open his magic apertures.However, on the way to the Second Peak's Chengling District, his identity token vibrated. Xu Qing took it out and saw that it was Zhang San who had sent him a voice transmission."Xu Qing, you're back?""I returned yesterday," Xu Qing replied."Where are you? Can you come here or should I go there? I have something important to discuss with you.""I'm heading toward the Chengling District to take a look at the medicinal herbs." Xu Qing was a little curious about why Zhang San was looking for him. At the same time, he recalled the records on his cave abode's control plate that the captain had been trying to visit him many times."Alright, there's Hundred Herbs Square in the Chengling District. We'll meet there."The voice transmission ended.Xu Qing walked toward the Second Peak's Chengling District. Not long later, he found the Hundred Herbs Square that Zhang San had mentioned. This shop was very large and could be considered a famous shop in the area.From afar, Xu Qing saw Zhang San outside the Hundred Herbs Square. He was sitting on the steps at the side and smoking a pipe. His gray Daoist robe made him inconspicuous. A smile appeared on his face when he saw Xu Qing. He stood up and patted the dust on his butt before walking over quickly."Junior Brother Xu Qing, did the captain look for you ?" Zhang San pulled Xu Qing to a corner and asked in a low voice."I haven't seen the captain since I returned." Xu Qing felt a little strange and glanced at Zhang San."That's good. Recently, Captain has been borrowing money everywhere like a lunatic. He almost mortgaged the right to open my port and told me that he wanted to buy a method to disguise himself as another race. Once he succeeds, he'll earn at least a hundred times more. I think he'll look for you too.""Do you still have the right to open the port?" Zhang San looked at Xu Qing expectantly."Yes." Xu Qing nodded."That's great!" Zhang San laughed and quickly said."Xu Qing, give me your right to open the port. It took a while to persuade the captain to not mortgage his right. In that case, including yours, we can do a big job.""I have accurate news that the sect is going to war with the Sea Corpse Race. Actually, many people have guessed this. However, different people have different thoughts when they get information. This is related to the situation.""Some people think about protecting themselves when they hear about war, some think about how to obtain contribution points, some are terrified and nervous, and some think about getting rich but don't know how to achieve it.""Most of them will think of hoarding materials, but I'm different." At this point, Zhang San had a proud expression."Xu Qing, let me tell you. When the war starts, it will be time to make a fortune. Don't think about accumulating resources at this time. It's useless and you'll only be hated by others.""We don't need money from fellow disciples, we will take money from the sect!""When the war with the Sea Corpse Race starts, the sect will definitely launch a big campaign. When the time comes, they will definitely make a requisition of all the ports to serve the war. Regardless of whether it's to arrange magic artifacts, place warships, or for the movements of the various peaks, the ports will be the focus.""The number of ports on the Seventh Peak is limited, so once I open three ports and connect them together, the sect will definitely choose to requisition such a large port.""As for requisitioning, they have to pay money, so we just have to build it before the war starts and set up more berths. I have calculated it; basically, if this war lasts three months, we'll recoup our losses. If it lasts for a year, we'll earn at least four times our investment!""This opportunity is extremely rare, we have to make use of it."Hearing Zhang San's words, Xu Qing's eyes widened as he stared deeply at Zhang San. He couldn't help but feel admiration in his heart.He really felt that Zhang San's sense for money far exceeded that of ordinary people.Noticing Xu Qing's expression, Zhang San felt very happy and laughed."Xu Qing, you and the captain don't have to take out a single spirit stone. Just give me the right to open the port. I'll invest the capital. When the profits are calculated, you and the captain will each take 25% of the profits, and I'll take 50%. Is that okay?""Moreover, the port will still be operating after the war ends. In that case, this benefit will last for a long time." Zhang San looked at Xu Qing and waited for his answer.Xu Qing thought about it and handed a token to Zhang San. This was the token to establish the port.Zhang San was excited and was filled with motivation."A year later, I'm confident that you'll get at least a few million spirit stones!" Zhang San laughed. He took out a jade slip and quickly contacted his connections to plan this matter. After that, he waved at Xu Qing and bade farewell.After watching Zhang San leave, Xu Qing sighed inwardly. He truly felt that Zhang San was a genius. Not only was he talented in refining tools, but his cultivation speed also didn't seem slow. Moreover, he had an astonishing business acumen."I hope I can really get so many spirit stones in a year." When he thought of Zhang San saying that he could get a few million spirit stones in a year, Xu Qing's heart raced slightly. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  The amount of benefits Zhang San mentioned was too great. This attracted Xu Qing, whose pockets were almost empty.A long time later, Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and entered the Hundred Herbs Square.After the time it took for two incense sticks to burn out, Xu Qing walked out after buying the poisonous grasses he needed. Although he had spent a lot of spirit stones here, he was satisfied. There were a lot of poisonous grasses in this shop, and their quality even surpassed the Yang medicinal herbs.Xu Qing felt that this was what a normal herb shop should look like.After all, the vast majority of herbs were poisonous.He bought a lot of poisonous grasses that he had only seen in the book Grandmaster Bai had left behind in the past. Now, he planned to go back and try to refine a new poison.He only felt that it was a pity that there were no Ghost Desires here. However, the shopkeeper suggested that he could order the goods at full price and come to collect them in a month or so. Xu Qing agreed."I have to refine a poison that can quickly kill Foundation Building cultivators, especially the Sea Corpse Race!"Xu Qing soared into the air and headed straight for the Seventh Peak's cave abode.Time flowed by. As Xu Qing refined poison and cultivated in the cave abode, half a month passed very quickly.A piece of news quickly spread in the sect, attracting the attention of everyone. Even the atmosphere of the entire Seven Blood Eyes felt oppressive under the spread of this news."The Sea Corpse Race and the Seven Blood Eyes might start an all-out war!"

Chapter 224 Declaration Of War
This news spread through the entire Seven Blood Eyes like a storm, attracting the attention of countless cultivators on both the mountain and at the foot of the mountain.Although high-level cultivators were the main force in war, there were many things on the battlefield that still needed Qi Condensation cultivators to do. For example, setting up array formations, logistics, transportation, and various other war tasks.In fact, even the Sea Corpse Race would definitely send out Qi Condensation cultivators to fight. In that case, the piedmont disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes would have to fight as well.After all, compared to the cultivators on the mountain, the piedmont disciples had no right to refuse. Only when they reached the Foundation Building realm did they have the right to decide if they wanted to participate in the battle.As such, this news quickly caused a commotion in the main city. Xu Qing wasn't surprised.Regardless of whether it was when he saw the battle between the seven peak lords, the elders, and the experts of the Sea Corpse Race at sea, Huang Yan's two reminders, or Zhang San's plan, they all pointed out that war was about to arrive. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Xu Qing originally didn't have many thoughts about the war. Previously, when he went up the mountain, Zhang Yunshi had said that Foundation Building cultivators of the Seven Blood Eyes had no obligation to participate in the war. Hence, the start of the war was mostly driven by benefits.However, after cultivating the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, Xu Qing's thoughts changed a little. In reality, all Foundation Building cultivators who cultivated the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art valued war.Devouring souls was the easiest in war. As long as the cultivator could survive, they would be able to open many magic apertures.It was because killings on the battlefield would be extremely frequent and it would be easier to devour souls in the chaotic battle. Moreover, the souls of the Sea Corpse Race had a miraculous effect on the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art.This point tempted Xu Qing, especially since he had tasted the sweetness of the Sea Corpse Race's soul‚Ä¶Right now, he had opened 20 magic apertures and was only 10 away from forming the first ball of life fire. He had also calculated that if he used Ghost Desires and ammonites to attract sea beasts like last time, because the requirement to open the magic aperture would be increasingly difficult, he estimated that it would take at least two years to form the life fire.Although he might occasionally encounter Foundation Building ferocious beasts that could speed up this process, it was extremely dangerous.This didn't include the journey back and forth and whether the Ghost Desires were enough. If these factors were added, it would probably take more than three years. Being out in the sea for such a long time without the Mystic Brilliance Form would mean huge danger.When Qi Condensation cultivators went out to sea and encountered powerful beings, the other party might feel that it wasn't worth killing them. However, when they saw that they were Foundation Building cultivators, most of them wouldn't think so.The value of killing Foundation Building cultivators was much higher. This way, although the war was dangerous, the cost-performance ratio was much higher.When this news about the war spread, Zhang San was very attentive to their three ports and didn't delay the process.Under the bombardment of a large number of spirit stones, not only did he choose the areas to establish the ports, but he also hired thousands of piedmont disciples of the Sixth Peak and tens of thousands of handymen. The construction had already begun.With so many people involved, the port experienced new changes every day. At the same time, plans for commercialization of the port were underway.As the deputy director of the Transportation Department, Zhang San used his authority to build a large branch here that specialized in serving the new port.The captain was the same. Although he wasn't in the sect, he had also arranged for the Black Division to move to the new port as a branch of the Homicide Department.Also, after Huang Yan heard from some unknown source that Xu Qing had shares here, he arranged for the Pilotage Department to come over and built a branch here. Gu Muqing quietly bought a very large shop here to open another medicine shop.As for the shopkeeper of the Sixth Peak who had tried to extort Xu Qing, it was unknown if it was because of the arrangements of the person behind him, but he also arrived immediately and bought a shop to express his goodwill.As everyone rushed in, the new port became lively. It became the hottest topic in the sect other than the war.When Ding Xue found out about this, she naturally had to express her support. She bought three shops that formed a triangle and surrounded Gu Muqing's medical shop.It was as though she hadn't thought of what to do with them and did this just to show her power.She even contacted her best friends from the various peaks and received their help.The second day after Ding Xue bought the shops, Zhao Zhongheng quickly arranged for the Dispatch Department to build a branch here‚Ä¶Zhang San was very satisfied. He was naturally the one who spread the news of the port. However, the one who planned this move was the captain. Before the captain left, he told him that he had to use Xu Qing's name. After all, handsome people were very useful.Zhang San also began to mobilize his connections. Very soon, people from the Third, Fourth and Fifth Peaks also came to buy shops one after another, causing the entire new port to have everything a cultivator needed.As for the casinos, they also came after hearing about this port that almost completely belonged to the Homicide Department.They bought the most shops. Almost all such places in the main city opened branches here.The shops in the other parts of the city were moving in one after another. Half a month later, when Xu Qing obtained the Ghost Desires from the Hundred Herbs Square, the prototype of the port was already ready.He also applied for a number from the Seventh Peak and the port was designated as Port 176.On the day the port was opened for use, Xu Qing moved out of the mountain and found a remote berth in Port 176.On the way there, he looked at the port that had begun to operate and sighed with emotion. In order to obtain the sect's requisition fee, Zhang San had indeed done his best to speed up the construction.As he moved back to the harbor from the cave abode, Xu Qing, who was sitting on the magic ship, listened to the sound of the waves and felt the light swaying of the magic ship. This feeling made him feel as though he had returned to when he was in Qi Condensation. He had postponed his trip to the sea.This was because during these few days, there was more and more news about the war. Every day, one could see streams of light returning from the outside world, heading straight for the seven mountain peaks.This made Xu Qing realize that the footsteps of war were about to arrive.Another half a month passed. When Xu Qing used his Life Art to finally wear down 10% of the 21st magic aperture, the bells from the Seven Blood Eyes' Seven Peaks rang at the same time. It was an extremely rare occurrence.When the bells rang and their chimes echoed through the entire Seven Blood Eyes, the expressions of everyone who heard it, regardless of whether they were on the mountain or at the foot of the mountain, changed. Many disciples even walked out of their magic boats and looked at the seven mountain peaks.There were many Foundation Building cultivators hidden among them.The same scene was happening in the entire Seven Blood Eyes' main city.It was the same for the Foundation Building cultivators living on these seven mountain peaks. They walked out of their respective cave abodes and their eyes revealed sharpness.Shortly after, a vast and aged voice suppressed the bell chimes and spread throughout the entire Seven Blood Eyes."Disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes, I'm Xue Lianzi. You can call me ancestor. Today, I am announcing that the war is here.""My sect declares war on the Sea Corpse Race.""The assets of the Sea Corpse Race exceed 100 billion. This old man has decided to take out half of the assets as your reward!"Almost at the instant this old voice echoed, countless blood threads soared into the sky from the seven peaks of the Seven Blood Eyes. These blood threads were densely packed like countless worms. They swept into the sky in unison, forming a vast cloud that covered the entire sky of the Seven Blood Eyes.One could see that this cloud was completely formed by red lines. They gathered in the sky and swam rapidly, finally outlining a huge face.This face was that of an old man. It was such a shocking sight that thunder rumbled in the sky. In fact, the entire Seven Blood Eyes was dyed red. One could vaguely sense the intent of the Flame Phoenix that Xu Qing had seen back then.From afar, it was as though this world had turned into a demon's domain.At the same time, a monstrous sword qi erupted from the huge blood eye of the Seven Blood Eyes' First Peak and headed straight for the sky, transforming into a blood-colored sword.This large sword was formed by countless red lightning bolts and looked soul-stirring. It was as though any bolt of lightning inside could destroy a Foundation Building cultivator.On that large sword stood a red-faced old man. He was the Peak Lord of the First Peak. As he stood there, his aura was crimson red and his killing intent towered into the sky, as though he could kill gods."I heed the ancestor's decree!"Almost at the instant he appeared, a similar rumbling sound rang out from the Second Peak. A huge pill furnace rose into the air and a graceful middle-aged woman was sitting cross-legged on it. The fragrance of pills permeated the air and was enveloped by a dazzling light.The pill furnace under the middle-aged woman was still refining a pill that was letting out light like the sun, and the fluctuations it emitted were extremely terrifying."I heed the ancestor's decree!"Next was the Third Peak. A middle-aged man who looked like a scholar walked out. Under his feet was a ball of yellow fog. As the fog churned, it emitted a terrifyingly bizarre aura. There were also countless illusory figures that were faintly discernible around him, like ghosts.Xu Qing's mind shook when he saw them. The feeling they gave him was extremely similar to the white-clothed faceless woman in the ruined city. It was as though they came from the same source.They were all bizarre entities!"I heed the ancestor's decree!" After walking out, the middle-aged scholar calmly spoke. After that, a person walked out of the Fourth Peak.This person was a burly man. As he appeared, one could clearly see a chain on his body. One end of the chain was in his hand, and the other end had a huge eyeball.As soon as the eyeball appeared, the divine intent erupted explosively. Although the feeling it gave Xu Qing wasn't as powerful as Binding, it was still a divine creature.As for the Fifth Peak and Sixth Peak, no one appeared!Finally, it was the Seventh Peak.As the Seventh Peak's mountain rumbled, Old Master Seventh's figure walked out. He walked toward the sky step by step, looking extremely ordinary. Among everyone in the sky, he looked the least imposing.From afar, he looked like an ordinary person with no cultivation at all. However, his appearance immediately caused the other Peak Lords other than the First Peak's Peak Lord to lower their heads to show their respect."I heed the ancestor's decree!" Old Master Seventh arrived in the air and cupped his fists and bowed to the sky ancestor.The gaze of the ancestor, Xue Lianzi, instantly landed on Old Master Seventh. He revealed a hint of surprise before laughing loudly."Little Seven, your Dao actually rose silently. You're about to break through. Great!"

Chapter 225 Participating In The War
Old Master Seventh smiled at Xue Lianzi's praise but didn't speak. He only cupped his fists and bowed again.The ancestor, who was outlined by the blood lines in the sky, smiled and shifted his gaze toward the Seven Blood Eyes' main city. With his cultivation, he seemed to be able to capture all the disciples in the city in his mind.His voice was like thunder, exploding word by word."In this battle, the Peak Lords and the elders have to participate. However, Foundation Building and Qi Condensation don't have such an obligation. This old man knows that all of you worked hard and staked your lives to make progress. Although the sect helped during this period, it wasn't much.""Therefore, this war isn't compulsory for you. Those who are willing to participate will be rewarded. The entire battle missions will be carried out voluntarily. Which of you Seven Blood Eyes disciples is willing to participate in the battle?!"As soon as the ancestor finished speaking, the identity tokens of all cultivators at the fifth level of Qi Condensation and above of the Seven Blood Eyes instantly vibrated. Numerous matters regarding the benefits of participating in the battle were imprinted in their tokens.All the cultivators instantly knew about the rewards after taking their tokens out. Some of their eyes even revealed sharpness and desire after checking it.Very soon, many voices replied from the main city and the mountain peaks."Disciple is willing to participate in the battle!""Disciple is willing to participate in the battle!!"As the sounds of participation rang out one after another, numerous figures flew into the air from the main city and the seven mountain peaks and stood respectfully.Among them, there were Foundation Building cultivators and high-level Qi Condensation disciples who floated in the air with flight talismans.Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at everything. He then took out his identity token and checked the information inside."The participants will be rewarded according to their cultivation base. The first wave of rewards will be distributed immediately. 500 spirit stones for the fifth level of Qi Condensation to 3,000 spirit stones for the Perfected Qi Condensation realm, 100,000 spirit stones for the Foundation Building realm to 500,000 spirit stones for the Perfected Foundation Building realm. If you agree to participate in the war, you will be given the rewards immediately. However, once you participate in the battle, you can't withdraw unless the war ends. However, you can choose to accept missions during this period!"This was the first benefit for cultivators participating in the war in the jade slip. When Xu Qing saw this, his expression changed slightly. Being able to receive 100,000 spirit stones just for participating was already a considerable reward."During war, missions are delegated by the Peak Lords to the elders of the various peaks. After the elders issue the missions, anyone can accept it. The mission rewards are extremely generous.""All personal gains from the mission or from outside don't have to be reported. They belong to the individual themselves!""All those who participated in the Seven Blood Eyes' victory in the war will be distributed the sect's gains from this battle according to the level and number of the completed missions!""In addition, the soul of the Sea Corpse Race has a miraculous effect on those who cultivate the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art. It's an incomparable delicacy. You'll know after you try it!""Who is willing to participate in this battle?!"The very first rewards for this war were already so many spirit stones. One could imagine that the subsequent missions would have even more astonishing rewards. Xu Qing was tempted.He was truly lacking spirit stones.His gains and savings had almost been cleared up after he bought the magic artifact and poisonous grasses. Although he had some spirit stones, they were only enough for his daily life.Spirit stones were extremely important in cultivation. If Xu Qing had ten million spirit stones now, he could issue missions to get a large number of cultivators from the sect to help him capture Foundation Building sea beasts. In fact, if he had more spirit stones, he could even get the elders to help.He would have a much easier time in opening 30 magic apertures.Even if he didn't seek the help of the elders, if he had enough spirit stones, he could upgrade his magic ship to a high level. He would then carefully avoid some powerful forces and dominate an area on the Forbidden Sea.Hence, the rewards from this war caused Xu Qing's breathing to quicken.He was also tempted by the thought of getting the souls of the Sea Corpse Race. To Xu Qing, who had tasted the sweetness of Sea Corpse Race's soul, the temptation was even greater. He was a decisive person, so after some thoughts, he made the decision.Figures rushed into the sky one after another and the sounds of participation rose and fell. There were about a thousand Foundation Building cultivators from the Seven Blood Eyes' seven mountain peaks in total. This time, 70% of them chose to participate in the battle. They were densely packed and their auras were astonishing, causing the wind in all directions to stir and the sea to rumble violently.Many elders also walked out of their respective peaks and stood beside the Peak Lords.At the same time, on the ground of the main city, countless Qi Condensation cultivators weighed their options. Some chose to participate in the battle, while others prepared to wait and see.After all, those who could become a disciple of the Seven Blood Eyes and live to the fifth level of Qi Condensation or above were far from ordinary."Open the sect's array formation and connect with the teleportation array in the merfolk island!" As Xue Lianzi spoke, the entire Seven Blood Eyes rumbled. The seven huge blood eyes on the seven mountain peaks emitted a demonic light that enveloped the entire area.The array formation was activated.In everyone's identity tokens, other than the information about the rewards, there was also a simple plan for this battle. It was as though the sect wasn't afraid of this plan being exposed at all.The entire plan was to use the four islands of the merfolk race as the front-line command center. Under the huge protection array of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, everyone who participated in the battle only needed to hold their identity token and silently chant the word 'participate'; they would then be teleported to the merfolk island by the array formation.This plan allowed the battlefield to be far away from the Seven Blood Eyes. The strategic location of the merfolk islands was extremely important as it was between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race.Previously, the Seven Blood Eyes had used the competition as a cover and used the ancestor's breakthrough to invade the other party's territory to cause chaos, catching the Sea Corpse Race off guard, which allowed them to take down the merfolk islands in one go.Hence, the first step of this strategic plan was already completed. The next step was to completely gain a firm foothold in the merfolk island under the counterattack of the Sea Corpse Race. rThe first step was a conspiracy. The second step was an open scheme."Participants, set off!" Xue Lianzi waved his hand. His figure directly transformed into countless terrifying red lines that whistled toward the sect's array formation. He was instantly teleported away.After that, the Peak Lords of the five peaks stepped in one after another.Behind them were the elders of the various peaks, and lastly, there were more than 700 Foundation Building cultivators from the seven peaks.The group of people had a majestic momentum and carried a monstrous murderous aura as they teleported and disappeared.Among the Foundation Building cultivators, Xu Qing didn't teleport immediately. Instead, he glanced at the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes.Although the sect must have reserved a portion of its strength to protect it, the current sect was clearly much more empty than usual. Even though the sect's protective array was activated, it still looked defenseless.From the moment he arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes until now, Xu Qing had come to know that most of the people in this sect were schemers. He didn't believe that the sect's ancestor and the seven Peak Lords would be careless about this."It's very likely that the Seven Blood Eyes' foundation isn't just what we see now. There must be something deeper. It's even very likely that the current sect and main city are a trap to lure other forces."Xu Qing fell into deep thought. He lifted his head and looked at the sect's array formation. The light in his eyes was restrained as he held his identity token and chanted in his mind."Participate!"At the next instant, Xu Qing's figure was enveloped by a beam of light that fell from the array formation above. His entire person disappeared with the light.At that moment, in the main city, such beams of light descended one after another. A large number of disciples were teleported away under these beams of light. One could imagine that such beams of light would continue to descend in the coming days.On the Forbidden Sea, where the four merfolk islands were, the sky was also enveloped by the light of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city's array formation, enveloping all four islands.Other than its own defense, the array formation here was clearly synchronized with the Seven Blood Eyes' main city. It could allow disciples to teleport over instantly.Outside these four islands, wind and lightning were rampaging and thunder rumbled endlessly as though powerful beings were fighting. The area further away was covered by fog and surging waves. The sounds of fighting could clearly be heard from the fog.One could vaguely see that the people fighting against the Sea Corpse Race were mostly merfolks!Clearly, after being suppressed, the merfolk race had chosen to submit completely and was arranged to be cannon fodders.However, this battle didn't look intense, as though it was just the norm. On the four islands, countless buildings had been built that were different from the merfolk race's. They were tall towers.Every tall tower shone with blue lightning that flowed in all directions and connected to the other tall towers, causing the four islands to seem to be connected as one.There were also countless large-scale magic artifacts installed on the four islands. From time to time, they would rumble and activate rows of astonishing spells that landed on the distant battlefield. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Array formations filled the four islands. Every few breaths, the shadows of array runes would form in the sky and rapidly fuse into the surrounding areas to reinforce the array formation here.Many simple residences were opened up. On Hidden Island, a large amount of anomalous substances were extracted and transformed into nine-headed snakes that seemed to have been controlled to fight for the Seven Blood Eyes.It was the same for other islands. After the Seven Blood Eyes tampered with the volcanoes on Mire Island, they were currently erupting. Every time they erupted, they would cause the ground to tremble and terrifying power to pour out in all directions.More than half of Image island had been turned into a sword pool. Flying swords were soaked in it as though they were being nurtured. Clearly, this was a method of the First Peak. Once they were used, their might would definitely shake the world.The greatest change was on Binding Island.An eye had been planted on this island. The size of this eye was comparable to 70% of the island. Upon closer inspection, it was exactly the same as the Seven Blood Eyes' Blood Eyes!In the blink of an eye, information was transmitted to the identity tokens of all the cultivators on the four islands.When Xu Qing arrived, he was in the air above Mire Island. The instant he appeared, he saw the four islands of the merfolk race that had changed drastically.Xu Qing's mind shook as he looked into the distance. He saw Xue Lianzi and the five Peak Lords standing in the air above Binding Island.There were also the other two Peak Lords who were bowing to greet the old ancestor and seemed to be reporting something.One of these two was an old woman. She was stepping on a vast array formation that seemed to be overlapping with tens of thousands of array formations.The other was an old man with a dark expression. He didn't give off any sense of dignity but was filled with bitterness. It was as though there was a bitter tribulation in his heart that he couldn't resolve.He held a wine gourd in his hand and drank as he walked in the sky.They were the Peak Lords of the Fifth and Sixth Peaks.Looking at the islands, Xu Qing suddenly understood why the Fifth and Sixth Peak Lords didn't appear in the sect.The changes to the four islands were the arrangements of their two peaks!

Chapter 226 Someone Teleported
Right at this moment, the volcanoes on Mire Island rumbled and erupted one after another. Thick black ashes rolled in all directions and were poured onto the battlefield of the Sea Corpse Race by the power of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation.However, some of them still landed on Mire Island like black snowflakes.The ground continued to quake and rumbling sounds that drowned out all sounds appeared from time to time.Xu Qing didn't dare to stay in the sky for long. He headed straight for the ground. When he landed, he saw countless Seven Blood Eyes' disciples from the various peaks bustling about.Everyone had a target.Some were building array formations, some were cooperating with the maintenance of magic artifacts, and some were rushing toward the teleportation array that linked to the distant battlefield.In the air, the figures of Foundation Building cultivators whistled past. Accompanied by waves of light, new people continuously descended on the four islands.Xu Qing's identity token continued to vibrate. Information about missions flowed out like a waterfall.While maintaining vigilance against his surroundings, Xu Qing took out his token and quickly checked it.One mission after another appeared in the token. Some disappeared as soon as they appeared. Clearly, they had been taken away by someone. Most of them were missions that required many people to complete. They showed the number of participants required, and once it was filled, the mission would disappear."Maintenance of the magic artifacts on Binding Island. Need 30 Sixth Peak disciples at fifth level of Qi Condensation and above, and three Foundation Building cultivators. 50,000 spirit stones will be distributed according to the contribution and cultivation level.""60 Qi Condensation disciples and two Foundation Building disciples are needed in Image Island to rear magic artifacts for the First Peak's disciples. The total reward is 70,000 spirit stones.""300 array formation specialists required. The total reward is 60,000 spirit stones!""Need ten Qi Condensation cultivators to accept the bizarre body. One thousand spirit stones a day!"Among the large amount of mission information, there was one that was at the top. It was a war mission."Long-term war mission: Head to the battlefield outside the islands and kill the Sea Corpse Race cultivators. Regardless of cultivation level, kill ten thousands of them and obtain the Core Formation opportunity."When Xu Qing saw this mission, his heart trembled. The reward was extremely generous. One could imagine that the Core Formation opportunity would definitely make a large number of Foundation Building cultivators envious.Just as Xu Qing was continuously flipping through the mission information, a blood-colored mission suddenly appeared among the many missions. Every word on it was blood-colored."Need ten Foundation Building disciples who can activate Mystic Brilliance Form to cross the battlefield and head to the third island outside the Sea Corpse Race's territory. The specific details will be arranged by the elders. This mission is extremely dangerous. If you face the danger of a Golden Core, the participant will be rewarded with eight million spirit stones each."The moment Xu Qing saw this blood-colored mission, he was shaken by the reward. His breathing became hurried. However, it was obvious that the danger of this mission was extremely great and there was a slim chance of surviving.However, at the next instant, the number of participants for the mission was filled. The mission instantly disappeared from the vast list.Xu Qing fell silent. He thought of what Zhang Yunshi had said that day. In the sect's war, drive the disciples with benefits. Both sides were willing to accept this."I need to accept a mission." A long time later, Xu Qing started looking at the suitable missions. The rewards for Qi Condensation were usually not much and most of them were shared by many people. Most of the rewards for Foundation Building missions required one to have the Mystic Brilliance Form.Xu Qing's cultivation made it impossible for him to accept such missions. At the same time, Xu Qing felt that he was still a little lacking to go to the battlefield.What he needed was the kind that could both earn spirit stones and kill the Sea Corpse Race.It wasn't like there weren't such missions among the many missions. Very soon, Xu Qing saw one."There are several small-scale teleportation arrays left behind by the Sea Corpse Race in the underwater world of the four islands of the merfolk race. Need eight Foundation Building cultivators to investigate and destroy all the teleportation arrays on each island. If you encounter the Sea Corpse Race, kill them. If you can't defeat them, report it immediately. You will be rewarded with 10,000 spirit stones for each teleportation array destroyed. Kills will be scored and ranked."The instant he saw this mission, Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. This mission suited his needs very well, so he didn't hesitate at all and immediately accepted it.Almost at the instant he accepted the mission, the eight spots needed for this mission were instantly gone. Xu Qing was the last one. If he had hesitated just a bit, he wouldn't have been able to get it.After receiving this mission, new information immediately popped up in Xu Qing's identity token. The names of the eight participants were hidden. They had already been automatically assigned to different islands.The island Xu Qing was assigned to was none other than Mire Island.There was a detailed introduction of the appearance and fluctuations of the small-scale teleportation arrays and how to destroy them. There was even a reminder that the Sea Corpse Race members were found to have teleported from these arrays.According to the judgment of the command center, under the envelopment of the sect's large array formation, even if such small-scale teleportation arrays were forcibly activated, they would not be able to teleport cultivators with two balls of life fire. There was a high chance that the ones who were teleported here were all Sea Corpse Race members who hadn't formed their life fire.The purpose of these people coming here should be to attempt to destroy the array formations and magic artifacts of the various islands like sacrificial soldiers.The activation of the Sea Corpse Race's teleportation arrays didn't require spirit energy and magic power but rather anomalous substances. In the underwater world, there were a large number of anomalous substances in the seawater, so these arrays were extremely hidden and difficult to detect.As such, this mission was issued.Xu Qing knew that there was someone else on this island who had accepted this mission like him. As such, he headed straight for the nearest city here. Regardless of which island it was, the entrance to the underwater world was in the cities. Xu Qing was experienced in this.As for the merfolk's cities, most of them were in ruins. However, the jade slip Huang Yan had given him that day also had a very detailed description of Mire Island. He remembered that there was an entrance tunnel that wasn't far from here.Xu Qing sped up in the air. The volcanoes continued to erupt from time to time, the ground quaked, deafening explosions sounded, and black snowflakes fell.About fifteen minutes later, Xu Qing saw a ruined city in the distance. He didn't stop at all and flew over. On the way, he also saw some Seven Blood Eyes disciples but they didn't greet each other and hurriedly passed by each other.Very soon, Xu Qing found the entrance. The surroundings had already been opened up. The tunnel emitted waves of cold air as well as a bloody intent. The seawater that should have been in the depths had risen quite a bit now and could be seen from the outside.Xu Qing stood at the edge of the entrance. After taking a look at the tunnel, he took out a bag containing poison and threw it down. After it mixed with the water, he jumped in.He grabbed the poison pouch and rushed down rapidly. The entire process only lasted for more than 30 breaths of time. Xu Qing continued to move deeper and slowly approached the exit.The deeper he went, the quieter his surroundings became. The clamor outside was isolated by the seawater, even the rumbling of the volcanic eruptions was much weaker here. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, Xu Qing's vigilance was still there. When he got close to the exit, he threw out the bag, causing it to explode. A large amount of poison permeated the air and he rushed out.He immediately looked around. Most of the buildings here had collapsed, and the corals and sea anemone had decayed. It was probably because of the eruption of the black fog that day."I have to find the small-scale teleportation array of the Sea Corpse Race as soon as possible." Xu Qing retracted his gaze and calmly spoke.A long time later, seeing that there was no reaction, the magic power in Xu Qing's body surged into the purple crystal, causing it to emit a trace of suppression. At the next instant, the shadow quickly pointed in a direction.The reason why Xu Qing accepted this mission was because he knew that his shadow had a keen perception of anomalous substances. It might be a little difficult for others to find a teleportation array driven by anomalous substances under the sea and they would need some special magic artifacts.However, he didn't need them. In fact, Xu Qing even felt that magic artifacts might not be as keen as the shadow.The only thing that made him unhappy was that the shadow actually didn't take the initiative. Hence, he slowly spoke."Your inspection period will be reduced by ten days."The shadow trembled. As it rapidly probed the surroundings, the faint voice of the Diamond Sect's ancestor rang out from the black iron stick. "Master, don't be angry. The shadow might not understand you but I know that Master is usually very tired and needs us to take the initiative to share the burden. I'm worried about Master!"When the shadow heard this, killing intent instantly appeared.Xu Qing felt that what the Diamond Sect's ancestor said made sense. As such, he coldly glanced at the shadow and instantly suppressed it three times."I don't like your killing intent."The shadow trembled as though it was extremely aggrieved. It could only obediently show the way under the Diamond Sect's ancestor's smugness.Xu Qing followed the direction the shadow pointed and sped all the way. Very soon, he arrived at the place the shadow had found. This place was a concave land. It should have been blasted by a spell before, so it looked a mess.There was a teleportation array hidden in the mud layer and there were no energy fluctuations from it, so it was very difficult to detect. Only the anomalous substances here were slightly denser than the surroundings.Xu Qing took a look. He sensed that the array formation didn't seem to have been activated before. He followed the description in the mission and found the location of the array eye. He then stomped fiercely on it. The array formation collapsed loudly.After that, without needing Xu Qing to speak, the shadow quickly probed and pointed to the next location.Xu Qing sped all the way. Just like that, he destroyed the second and third teleportation arrays. In the area with the fourth teleportation array, he was about to destroy it when the array‚Ä¶ actually shone.Xu Qing let out a soft cry of surprise and immediately sensed carefully. Very soon, he sensed a hint of Foundation Building aura from the flickering of the array formation. Someone seemed to be teleporting from the other end of the array formation.In Xu Qing's perception, this aura wasn't very strong. It didn't seem to have reached the state of life fire, so he didn't destroy the array formation. Instead, he quickly took out the poison powder and used the fastest speed to spread it around the teleportation array.In the span of over ten breaths, Xu Qing released over a hundred types of poison in one go. As they enveloped the array formation, the black iron stick flew out and hid at the side.There was also a bell tied to this iron stick.When a person with flesh and blood used this bell, their soul would be affected. However, the artifact spirit wouldn't be affected, so Xu Qing tied the bell to the iron stick.As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor in the iron stick, he was clearly very excited, as though he felt that it was time for him to perform again.The shadow was also anxious and spread out, not to be outdone. After making preparations to pounce over in an instant, Xu Qing took out the magic ship just in case. He took a few steps back and squatted down. A cold glint flashed in his eyes and the black fire in his body rose, transforming into a dagger in his hand."It's coming." The instant Xu Qing muttered inwardly, the light of the teleportation array flickered. Amidst the dense anomalous substances, the figure of the Sea Corpse Race member slowly appeared.

Chapter 227 Three Snatching Food
Xu Qing had fought against the Perfected Qi Condensation cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race.They were extremely difficult to kill.They had a powerful physical body and tenacious life. When Xu Qing fought one of the Sea Corpse Race members before, he was only able to kill it by cutting off its parts.As for the Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race, Xu Qing had never fought them. As such, he was extremely vigilant at this moment. Even when he was all prepared, he still didn't get too close.Under his gaze, as the light of the teleportation array flickered, the figure of the Sea Corpse Race member inside rapidly became clear.This person wasn't transformed from a human corpse but rather a nonhuman race that Xu Qing had never seen before. There were bat-like wings on his back but they were somewhat torn. However, the aura of a Foundation Building cultivator was obvious.At the next instant, amidst the light rumbling of the teleportation array, the figure of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator became clear. The instant he completed the teleportation, he tried to retreat. Clearly, he was extremely vigilant.However, he would never have thought that there would be traps waiting for him.Almost at the instant he retreated, the seawater in the surroundings instantly fluctuated, transforming into highly condensed sea walls and blocking him.It was the same for the front, back, left, right, and even above.This caused the Sea Corpse cultivator to collide with it as he retreated, emitting a muffled boom. Although the astonishing power of his Foundation Building cultivation caused the sea wall to instantly collapse, the second, third, and fourth walls appeared one after another.The magic power in Xu Qing's body exceeded his peers by several times. At that moment, he was performing hand seals with both hands in the distance. Immediately, the undercurrents in the surrounding seawater surged and walls that were highly condensed headed straight for the Sea Corpse Race cultivators from all directions."Just you alone?" A cold glint flashed in the eyes of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator. He also saw his surroundings clearly and sensed that Xu Qing was the only one nearby.As for the poison in the surroundings, he didn't care. As a member of the Sea Corpse Race, his entire body was corpse poison. Moreover, the characteristics of his body made him unafraid of poison.He ignored the poisonous fog and performed hand seals. Just as he was about to cast the spell to blast open the surroundings, his expression suddenly changed. He sensed that after his wings came into contact with the surrounding poisonous fog, they actually showed signs of corrosion. This caused his mind to shake."What poison is this!"Moreover, all of the poison was gathered in the same place due to the sealing of the surrounding sea walls. With more than a hundred types of poison mixed, the body of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator showed signs of corrosion.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator was shaken and hurriedly performed a series of hand seals; a dense corpse poison instantly spread out from his body. He also flapped the wings on his back, emitting astonishing energy. It stirred up the surrounding seawater and directly blasted toward the surrounding sea walls.In an instant, the walls collapsed one after another, but for every wall that collapsed, three more would appear. Not only did the sea walls around the Sea Corpse Race cultivator not decrease, but they also increased.The poisonous fog continued to intensify, causing the expression of the Sea Corpse Race member who was trapped inside to change once again. Even with his powerful physical body and recovery, he felt that his body was starting to corrode faster.He even had a strong feeling that if this continued, it was very likely that he would be melted alive in about fifteen minutes.He took out a black-colored beast bone. There was a hint of killing intent in his eyes as he spat out blue blood on it.Immediately, the beast bone trembled and the anomalous substances on it erupted, forming a black shadow. The shadow seemed to have intelligence as it let out waves of heart-shaking laughter. A powerful aura spread out and swept in all directions.All the sea walls that came into contact with the aura instantly collapsed.Clearly, this beast bone was a type of magic artifact.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator chose the direction that faced Xu Qing and charged straight forward. As the sea walls collapsed one after another, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator rushed out of the poisonous fog. The killing intent in his eyes was intense and cold.Xu Qing's expression was calm and he was finally at ease."As expected, he's not a Foundation Building cultivator with the Mystic Brilliance Form."If it was the Mystic Brilliance Form, it wouldn't have taken so much trouble to break through his sea walls. The cultivator should have been able to knock through everything in an instant and reach him. Moreover, the possibility of the other party hiding his strength wasn't high. After all, this was the enemy's territory.His thought should be to kill Xu Qing and leave as soon as possible.Killing intent rose in Xu Qing's eyes. The Sea Corpse cultivator's magic artifact finally broke through the last sea wall. As the black shadow dissipated, the Sea Corpse cultivator headed straight for Xu Qing. However, Xu Qing's speed was even faster than him. He collided with the Sea Corpse Race cultivator in the blink of an eye.The Sea Corpse cultivator's entire body trembled violently and he spat out blood as he retreated. His expression was filled with horror as he saw Xu Qing continue to rush at him.The dagger in Xu Qing's right hand emitted black evil fire. Even in the sea, this fire was still burning. As Xu Qing got closer, the two of them collided again.A rumbling sound echoed. After several exchanges, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator was bewildered. He had a similar thought as the Sea Corpse Race cultivator at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm back then. His anomalous substances were ineffective against Xu Qing. His corpse poison was inferior to the other party's poison and his recovery was the same.As Xu Qing waved his dagger, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator raised his right hand. Immediately, the black shadow on the beast bone let out a sinister laugh and pounced toward Xu Qing.In fact, this black shadow's red eyes revealed greed. Just as it was about to get close, the black shadow's eyes suddenly widened and it quickly retreated. However, it was too late!At the next instant, the shadow that had been lying in ambush in the surroundings suddenly erupted. It had long been staring at this black shadow. At this moment, its emotions emitted hunger as it pounced over.The black shadow seemed to have encountered its natural enemy. As its body trembled, its speed was also affected. It was as though it was so intimidated that it didn't dare to escape and slowed down.In that instant, a large mouth opened in Xu Qing's shadow and swallowed it.The black shadow was swallowed alive by the shadow.With a burp, its invisible gaze stared at the Sea Corpse Race cultivator whose expression had changed drastically.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator's eyes revealed horror as he quickly retreated. However, the moment he retreated, waves of hurried bell sounds rang out. This sound carried an ethereal feeling that could penetrate the body and reach the soul.The instant it entered the ears of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator, his body involuntarily paused for a moment. Although he quickly broke free, the bell was already close.With a flash of black light, the black iron stick gave up on the bell and completely erupted with speed, directly piercing through the center of the Sea Corpse Race's brows. After circling around, it pierced through his neck again before picking up the falling bell again.At the same time, the black fiendish fire on Xu Qing's body erupted, as though he had transformed into a burning person. He also activated the feather magic artifact on his body.Xu Qing's speed was enhanced tremendously with the feather artifact. With just a few steps, he appeared in front of the heavily injured Sea Corpse Race cultivator.He instantly stabbed the other party's neck with his dagger. Just as the Sea Corpse Race cultivator let out a scream, Xu Qing's dagger transformed into black fire and surged into the other party's wound, entering his body and burning intensely.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator was about to struggle when Xu Qing ruthlessly slammed his knee into the Sea Corpse Race member's stomach.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator's body almost collapsed, and with the black flames burning his soul, he let out a hoarse howl.Amidst the intense struggle, the shadow also got close and extended along the legs of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator. Wherever it passed, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's trembling would intensify and his screams changed in pitch.The area covered by the shadow was rapidly corroding its body. It was as though‚Ä¶ it was transforming from a sea corpse to a real corpse.That was because the anomalous substances in it were being crazily devoured by the shadow. And as the shadow devoured the anomalous substances, its body actually emitted a trace of the Sea Corpse Race's aura.As for the black iron stick, it wasn't idle either. It headed straight for the bone magic artifact at the side. After it pierced the artifact, the Diamond Sect's ancestor manifested and sucked fiercely. Immediately, the bone magic artifact trembled and the energy inside was quickly absorbed by the Diamond Sect's ancestor.This process lasted for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. The Sea Corpse Race cultivator's struggle became weaker and weaker. Finally, his body lost all the anomalous substances and turned into ashes that dissipated into the seawater.As for the bone magic artifact, it was the same. It shattered into pieces.Xu Qing's eyes flickered with excitement. At that moment, the soul of the Sea Corpse Race was burning crazily in his body as it rushed toward the 21st magic aperture.Xu Qing's body trembled and his eyes gleamed. His 21st magic aperture was opened!As the spirit energy flowed in and magic power was nourished, Xu Qing turned his head and looked at the teleportation array, narrowing his eyes.He didn't destroy it but continued to set up more traps and waited silently. At the same time, he looked at the shadow.He had sensed that when the other party devoured the Sea Corpse Race, it had also emitted the aura of the Sea Corpse Race.Time flowed by, and Xu Qing felt a little regretful that there was no second one.The Sea Corpse Race wasn't stupid. After teleporting one out, they should have sensed something. As such, there was no second one. Xu Qing decided to destroy it and search for the next teleportation array.As for the shadow, its anomalous substances had become denser. Moreover, it was as though it had tasted the sweetness, it seemed to be even more eager than Xu Qing and was searching even harder. novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, the strength of his aura increased even more. Clearly, he had benefited greatly from devouring the other party's magic artifact.This made Xu Qing a little hesitant. After all, magic artifacts could be sold for money."Master, I couldn't control myself just now. Next time, I'll absorb 70% and leave 30% behind. This way, we can still sell it for money. I'm an artifact spirit and I'm confident that I can control it. It'll be very difficult for the buyer to notice.""However, I suggest that it's best if Master doesn't sell it to the sect. I know many black markets. We can sell there." The Diamond Sect's ancestor was an elite among humans. The moment Xu Qing's expression changed, he guessed the reason and hurriedly spoke carefully.Xu Qing glanced at the black iron stick but didn't speak.Just like that, a day later, with the hard work of the shadow, Xu Qing found another teleportation array hidden in a crack on the ground in the underwater world. After setting up the traps, he sat down and waited.Several days passed in the blink of an eye. Just as Xu Qing decided to destroy it and search for the next teleportation array, the teleportation array suddenly emitted fluctuations!

Chapter 228 Crazily Opening The Apertures
The energy fluctuation was very strong. The instant it spread out, Xu Qing felt a faint sense of fear and trepidation. The shadow also rapidly transmitted emotions of danger.The other party's figure quickly appeared.He was a very tall and burly man. Although he was still at the Foundation Building realm, the light of the ball of life fire in his body clearly spread out in the teleportation array.Clearly, this Sea Corpse Race cultivator had activated his Mystic Brilliance Form when he teleported into the enemy's territory to face the dangers that might appear on the other side of the teleportation array.Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all. He grabbed at the air. The instant the figure became clearer and met Xu Qing's gaze, Xu Qing directly crushed one of the arrangements on the teleportation array.With a boom, the teleportation array collapsed and the figure that was about to be teleported over instantly blurred. Only an unwilling roar could be heard faintly.Xu Qing was expressionless. He stood up and put away the arrangements he made, searching for the next location.Four days later, he found another place and waited silently. Finally, he saw a second cultivator from the Sea Corpse Race.The other party was also at the Foundation Building realm. When Xu Qing confirmed that the other party wasn't in the Mystic Brilliance Form, he instructed the shadow to investigate. The shadow's sensitivity to anomalous substances caused it to be very outstanding in detecting the cultivation of the Sea Corpse Race's cultivators.For the sake of mutual benefit, the shadow was very serious. After confirming that the person's cultivation wasn't in the Mystic Brilliance Form, the slaughter started immediately.This time, Xu Qing had learned from last time and adjusted his poison, making it even more invasive. At the same time, Xu Qing arranged for the ambush on the shadow's side to be the first wave of attacks.The Diamond Sect's ancestor was the second wave and he was the last wave.The magic ship was his final trump card.Just like that, after the time it took for two incense sticks to burn, the rumbling gradually dissipated. Amidst the continued weakness of the mournful cries, Xu Qing killed the second Sea Corpse cultivator. His soul was absorbed and burned continuously in his body, transforming into an impact that opened the 22nd magic aperture!This made Xu Qing very excited. He had a deeper understanding of the saying that the souls of the Sea Corpse Race had miraculous effects."If this continues, I'll be able to form my life fire in about eight more times!""Once the life fire is formed and placed on the life lantern, my combat strength will instantly advance by leaps and bounds‚Ä¶" Xu Qing's heart was filled with anticipation. Just as he was about to destroy this teleportation array, an aura spread out once again.The feeling this aura gave off was not of the Mystic Brilliance Form but very ordinary. However, the shadow instantly emitted fluctuations. Xu Qing immediately recognized that this aura was the same as the previous Sea Corpse Race cultivator in Mystic Brilliance Form.This person had learned from his previous mistake and restrained his Mystic Brilliance Form when he teleported again. However, he was unlucky to encounter Xu Qing.At that moment, his figure had almost taken shape when Xu Qing raised his right hand and ruthlessly slapped it. The teleportation array collapsed immediately. The figure in the array struggled intensely and wanted to rush out, but it was too late. It could only dissipate with an even more unwilling roar."I can only do this a few more times. The Sea Corpse Race will definitely sense it." Xu Qing mumbled, feeling a little regretful. This mission was really suitable for him.If he could not continue this, then he would have to go to the battlefield to get souls to form his life fire."Let's continue searching." Xu Qing pondered for a moment and made a decision. He then continued searching. Just like that, days passed. There weren't many Sea Corpse Race's teleportation arrays in the underwater world of Mire Island, only a dozen or so.Among them, Xu Qing had destroyed a total of eight. As for the Foundation Building cultivators, he encountered two more later. He quickly killed one of them while it was quite difficult to kill the other one. The second one had a lot of life-saving magic artifacts and seemed to be close to forming a life fire. This caused Xu Qing to spend more than two hours to kill him.This made him deeply realize how powerful the Sea Corpse Race's Foundation Building cultivators were. Moreover, the number of magic apertures opened by these two Foundation Building cultivators' souls was three, reaching 25.However, this was the end. Xu Qing found three more teleportation arrays but didn't encounter anyone again. He could only destroy them regretfully.The Diamond Sect's ancestor was also regretful, while the shadow was no more energetic.The teleportation arrays on Mire Island were completely cleared. Xu Qing helplessly returned to the island. Just as he handed in the mission and was pondering if he should accept the war mission, a message came from his identity token."I'm the Third Peak's elder, Ouyang Ling. I have seen your identity information. Your name is Xu Qing, right?"When Xu Qing saw this message, he immediately became vigilant and didn't respond."You don't have to think too much. This clearing mission was given by this old man but the completion rate of the other three islands is average. This old man doesn't care why you can be so fast. This is your private matter. However, I want you to continue searching the other two islands other than Mire and Binding Island. Are you willing to accept it?"This time around, what came out of the jade slip wasn't a message but a dignified voice that directly entered Xu Qing's mind, causing the 25 magic apertures in his body to tremble.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and slowly spoke after a moment of silence."I respect the elder's decree."When the Third Peak elder heard Xu Qing's answer, he was very satisfied. At the next instant, he adjusted Xu Qing's mission from searching for Mire Island to searching for all the islands.The corresponding spirit stone reward was also recorded on Xu Qing's identity token.Xu Qing looked at the numbers on it and felt even more anticipation for the war rewards this time.110,000 spirit stones!With 10,000 spirit stones for destroying a teleportation array, this was the reward for destroying 11 arrays. Among them, the four Foundation Building Sea Corpse Race cultivators weren't calculated in the spirit stone reward, but the number of kills were recorded.Xu Qing looked at the number and felt some regret. Among the four Foundation Building cultivators he killed, other than the first one who had a magic artifact, the last one had a magic artifact as well. "However, the main focus now is to open the magic apertures!" Xu Qing looked at the other three islands in the distance. He rose into the air and headed straight for Image Island.As for why he did not have to go to Binding Island, Xu Qing felt that it was related to that huge blood-colored eye that was planted on the island. This eye that was like the huge eye of the Seven Blood Eyes Sect would definitely be able to search for the teleportation arrays under the island.Whether this was the case or not, Xu Qing didn't care. He crossed the large sea and got closer and closer to Image.The entire land of Image was filled with sword pools.It was unknown what kind of power was in the sword pools, but it could make the flying swords inside even sharper. From afar, the sword pool in the center was the most majestic. It was filled with dense fog and one could vaguely see flying swords swimming inside.Countless small sword pools were built in the surroundings.When Xu Qing got close, he could clearly sense strands of dangerous auras emitted by those sword pools locking onto him.It was as though he was being screened, but these auras quickly dissipated. Xu Qing safely stepped onto Image Island, the former merfolk race's royal family's territory.He didn't stop here. According to the jade slip information Huang Yan had given him, he found the entrance to the underwater world.After he quickly stepped in, Xu Qing saw a gorgeous scene that surpassed the underwater world of Binding and Mire.Many palaces were built in the entire underwater world. Although many of them were destroyed now, one could still see their former glory.These‚Ä¶ were the former royal palaces of the merfolk race.Xu Qing looked around but didn't search for a teleportation array here.Such an obvious building complex must be the focus of others' search. At that moment, the shadow transmitted fluctuations, guiding Xu Qing away from the palace area.Half a day later, at a place filled with corals, Xu Qing sensed the teleportation array.Xu Qing's eyes lit up. He quickly arrived to take a look and made some arrangements before waiting.This time around, his luck wasn't bad. A few days later, the teleportation array here shone weakly and an aura spread out. As the illusory figure inside gradually became clearer, Xu Qing probed the other party's cultivation and attacked.The entire process didn't last long. Xu Qing killed the cultivator who arrived and destroyed the teleportation array before continuing to search.Just like that, time flowed by and very soon, a month passed. Xu Qing's figure appeared in all the areas in the underwater world. As he continued to search and destroy the teleportation arrays, his magic aperture slowly opened to the 28th."Two more to go!" The anticipation in Xu Qing's heart grew increasingly intense as he headed to Hidden Island.While he was carrying out this mission, the war between the Sea Corpse Race and the Seven Blood Eyes became increasingly intense.In the past two months, the Sea Corpse Race had launched a total of five large-scale campaigns. Their goal was to force the Seven Blood Eyes back from the merfolk islands.The scale of these five wars grew larger each time. However, under the tight defense of the Seven Blood Eyes, not only did they defend successfully, but they also took the initiative to attack many times. They exchanged blows with the Sea Corpse Race on the Forbidden Sea.More Seven Blood Eyes disciples had teleported over and joined the war.There were even many nonhuman allies of the Seven Blood Eyes who participated in the war one after another.This caused various nonhuman races to be seen on the merfolk islands.The Sea Corpse Race also had nonhuman races joining them. This caused the scale of the war between the two sides to continue to grow larger.  Best novel online free at‚Äã ùïüùï†ùïßùïñùïùùïìùïöùïü  However, this had nothing to do with Xu Qing. At the moment, he was speeding through the underwater world under the Hidden Island, approaching another teleportation array that the shadow had discovered."If I'm lucky, I should be able to break through the last two magic apertures in half a month!"Xu Qing glanced at the spirit stones in his identity token. The amount inside had already accumulated to more than 300,000 spirit stones, and the fact that his life fire was about to be formed made him even more excited."I wonder if I, who lit the life lantern after the life fire was formed, will have the strength to beat up the captain‚Ä¶"Xu Qing was filled with anticipation. The black iron stick that had followed him all the way was also trembling at this moment. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was equally excited. He could sense that he wasn't far from breaking through.'Once I break through, I'll be even more useful. I won't have to worry too much about being abandoned by Demon Xu for the time being!'It was the same for the shadow. Its anomalous substances became increasingly dense, causing Xu Qing to have to consider whether he should suppress it a few more times.As though he had guessed Xu Qing's thoughts, the shadow instantly trembled. When it instinctively expressed fawning emotions, determination appeared in Xu Qing's eyes.He felt that the shadow was too strange. After devouring the Sea Corpse Race, it could actually emit the aura of the Sea Corpse Race. This made Xu Qing vigilant. Hence, even though it was given a time limit to break through, he still felt that he had to intimidate it.Just as he was about to circulate the purple crystal in his body to suppress it, Xu Qing's expression suddenly froze. He lifted his head and looked into the distance.Five kilometers ahead, the teleportation array fluctuations spread out very clearly!There were various energy fluctuations. It wasn't just one person, but many!

Chapter 229 It's You!
The fluctuations were intense, and there was a muffled explosion as magic power spread out.Xu Qing stopped in his tracks. All kinds of thoughts rapidly flashed through his mind.The teleportation arrays ahead had clearly been activated. Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race had arrived.The sound of battle meant that the Seven Blood Eyes cultivators had encountered them.Right now, the vast majority of disciples were outside taking on various missions. Although there were people in the underwater world, Xu Qing didn't encounter many of them in the past two months.There was a high chance that they were cultivators who had accepted the mission to search and destroy teleportation arrays like him.Xu Qing didn't act rashly. Instead, he hid his tracks and slowly approached. When he was about to reach the battlefield, he squatted down and looked at the shadow.The shadow had followed Xu Qing for so long and was long familiar with his personality. Moreover, after being swept up by the Diamond Sect's ancestor a month ago, he was now working quite hard and quickly spread out.The source of light in the underwater world came from the surrounding corals that emitted gorgeous lights. This light could allow cultivators to see their surroundings clearly but because it wasn't strong light, the shadow was almost imperceptible.Moreover, this place was already filled with anomalous substances, so the shadow was able to quietly approach the area of the battle.It quickly checked and returned in an instant. After transmitting some emotions to Xu Qing, it laid out some shapes on the ground that only Xu Qing could see.Xu Qing lowered his head and looked over. Although he could control the shadow, he couldn't use its eyes to see the world.However, the shapes of the shadow still clearly told Xu Qing what it saw."Three Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race are surrounding and attacking a Seven Blood Eyes Foundation Building cultivator‚Ä¶ In your perception, none of them are in the Mystic Brilliance Form?" Xu Qing whispered.The shadow quickly nodded and revealed an eagerness to try."Are you sure you checked carefully, Little Shadow? You have to place Master's safety at the highest point like this old man. You can't be careless."The Diamond Sect's ancestor seized the opportunity and spoke in a low voice.He felt smug. If nothing unexpected happened later, his words would add points to Demon Xu and be able to take some of the shadow's credits. However, if the shadow made a mistake, his words would make his position in Demon Xu's heart even higher.The shadow emitted a ferocious intent and locked onto the black iron stick.Xu Qing didn't bother with them. After a moment of silence, he moved closer.Right now, he had opened 28 magic apertures. According to Xu Qing's calculations, if he could kill two or three more, he would definitely be able to open 30 magic apertures."We can't let them off!"Xu Qing concealed his cultivation base and gradually approached the battle. The fluctuations from ahead became clearer and the rumbling sounds became more frequent.A while later, Xu Qing finally saw the teleportation array.That area was filled with seaweed. Although the long seaweed covered the teleportation array, it couldn't hide the teleportation light that was slowly dissipating.A Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race was adjusting the teleportation array formation. It seemed like he was preparing to teleport more Sea Corpse Race cultivators over.This Sea Corpse cultivator was a human when he was alive. Now, other than his skin color and the corpse poison that permeated the air, his appearance was not too different from a living person.He looked like a scholar and wore a black Daoist robe. His cultivation base was emitting powerful energy.On the other side, there was a youth from the Third Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes wearing a dark yellow Daoist robe. The people fighting with him were two Foundation Building cultivators from the Sea Corpse Race whose auras were slightly weaker.There were also other arrangements made in the surroundings. As soon as Xu Qing got close, he felt that his identity token had broken off its connection and was blocked.Xu Qing didn't mind and observed the battlefield carefully.The youth from the Third Peak wore thin black gloves on his hands. As he waved them, black gas spread out, forming strange blurry figures in the surroundings.Between his brows, there was a drawing of a back view of a figure and it was trying to turn around.However, it seemed to be restricted and couldn't completely turn around.The two Sea Corpse Race cultivators he fought with gave Xu Qing the same feeling as the Foundation Building cultivator from the Third Peak. They didn't have the Mystic Brilliance Form but they should have opened about 20 magic apertures.They controlled the anomalous substances to attack. Coupled with their powerful bodies and corpse poison, and that they were going two against one, the youth from the Third Peak had many close shaves."The third peak's spells are strange!"Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and looked at the back of the youth. He then recalled the sect's evaluation of the Third Peak.The moment he looked at these people, they also noticed Xu Qing.The youth from the Third Peak suddenly used a powerful attack, forcing the two Sea Corpse Race members to back a little. He then quickly shouted toward Xu Qing."This place is restricted by the Sea Corpse Race, so I cannot send messages to the outside world. Help me. I'm willing to pay 100,000 spirit stones after this!!"When the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes encountered such a situation, most of them would speak like this. Even if they were from the same sect, there was no obligation for them to help each other. The instant the youth from the Third Peak spoke, the black-robed scholar from the Sea Corpse Race who was adjusting the teleportation array frowned. His body swayed and a rumbling sound rang out as he rushed toward Xu Qing.As he rapidly arrived, he performed a series of hand seals with both hands. Immediately, the power in the surroundings that could cut off the connection with the identity token spread out, enveloping Xu Qing, who was already within this range.In his judgment, it was too late for this Seven Blood Eyes disciple to retreat even if he wanted to.Since this disciple entered here, he decided to kill him.He was fully confident in himself. Although he didn't have Mystic Brilliance Form, he had already opened 29 magic apertures.In addition, with the Sea Corpse Race's physical body and recovery ability, coupled with this seabed that was filled with anomalous substances, he was confident in killing most of his peers, let alone the human Foundation Building cultivators which he had killed many.The magic apertures in his body were activated and his speed erupted. However, at the next instant, a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes. This was because‚Ä¶ the Seven Blood Eyes cultivator in front of him didn't retreat and escape as he had expected. Instead, the latter rushed toward him."Is he thinking that his cultivation and strength are enough, so he didn't escape but advanced instead? This doesn't match the actions of your Seventh Peak.""Then let's see who's stronger, your strength or my body!" The Sea Corpse Race cultivator sneered. His speed didn't decrease at all, as though he wanted to use his body to crush Xu Qing.In that instant, the two of them got closer and closer amidst their respective speeds."Purple Robe, this is someone from the Seventh Peak. There shouldn't be any fools in the Seventh Peak‚Ä¶" The youth from the Third Peak who was being surrounded in the distance wanted to take the opportunity to escape, but he couldn't do so and could only barely protect himself.At the next instant, the eyes of the Third Peak's youth suddenly narrowed.Not far away, Xu Qing and the Sea Corpse Race cultivator were rapidly approaching. When the two of them were only 100 feet away from each other, they used their artifacts at the same time, causing their speed to increase explosively in the blink of an eye.Xu Qing used a feather, and the scholar-like Sea Corpse cultivator used a black paper fan. They instantly took out their magic artifacts and sped up, but their direction was different.The moment Xu Qing received the enhancement from the feather, he abruptly changed his direction. His target wasn't this scholar but the two Sea Corpse Race members who were attacking the youth from the Third Peak.Killing the weak first was a tactic Xu Qing had always used.Usually, he would be able to use this method very smoothly. This time, he combined it with the feather magic artifact to increase his speed. However, the instant Xu Qing changed directions and rushed toward the youth from the Third Peak.That Sea Corpse Race scholar actually changed directions as well. His target wasn't Xu Qing but‚Ä¶ the youth from the Third Peak!Clearly, the words he said about matching their strength were intentional.It was to hide his true motive. In the blink of an eye, the two of them transformed into rainbows and appeared at the place where the youth from the Third Peak was fighting against the other two Sea Corpse cultivators.An explosion rang out.The youth from the Third Peak spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body was sent flying. At the critical moment, a black tattoo appeared on his neck.It was a lotus flower. At this moment, it transformed and floated above his head, neutralizing the fatal blow from the black-robed scholar.On the other side, Xu Qing had also gotten close. Black fiendish fire erupted from his entire body and the black iron stick charged with astonishing sharpness. He attacked almost at the same time as Xu Qing.In the blink of an eye, one of the two Sea Corpse Race members who were fighting with the youth from the Third Peak had his forehead penetrated and the other's neck was slit open by his dagger!The one whose forehead had been pierced let out a miserable cry and retreated abruptly. He quickly performed a series of hand seals, forming a huge six-armed statue of a deity in front of him. It let out a low shout as it blocked the attack of the black iron stick.However, the Sea Corpse Race member whose neck was slit by Xu Qing's dagger wasn't that lucky.The black dagger instantly transformed into flames that enveloped him. At the same time, Xu Qing punched into the other party's chest, breaking through his flesh and blood all the way to his heart. The 28 magic apertures in his body were fully opened and the black fiendish fire surged crazily into the Sea Corpse Race member's body!The Sea Corpse Race cultivator turned into a burning man almost instantly. As he let out a mournful cry, Xu Qing's shadow also took the opportunity to fiercely suck.  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Immediately, half of the Sea Corpse cultivator's body withered, speeding up the burning of the flames. His mournful cries also stopped abruptly as he lost his soul and died.As for the shadow, the aura of the Sea Corpse Race on it was even stronger but it was quickly digested and suppressed. All of this seemed to take a long time to describe but in reality, it happened in an instant.After killing one of them, Xu Qing looked at the black-robed scholar from the Sea Corpse Race. He was a little surprised that the other party's choice was the same as his.As for the black-robed scholar, he revealed a solemn expression for the first time. He didn't bother with the Third Peak's youth who had escaped death but stared at Xu Qing.Right at this moment, the teleportation array in the distance emitted fluctuations. As the light shone, an aura spread out.This aura wasn't strong and was quite weak. It seemed to be just a wisp that had been teleported over to observe the surroundings.After this aura spread out, it used some unknown method to sense Xu Qing. After a pause, the fluctuations of the teleportation array became intense. A roar seemed to travel through the space from the teleportation array."It's you. When I come out, I'll definitely kill you!"As the low shout echoed, the aura of Mystic Brilliance Form spread out from the teleportation array. The other party‚Ä¶ was none other than the Mystic Brilliance Form cultivator from the Sea Corpse Race whose teleportation had been interrupted by Xu Qing several times.His anger clearly swelled after he sensed Xu Qing and he immediately started teleporting!

Chapter 230 Xu Qing's Mystic Brilliance Form!
Hearing the roar of the Foundation Building cultivator in the Mystic Brilliance Form, the black-robed scholar fell into deep thought. As for the youth from the Third Peak, his mind shook and he had the intention to retreat.Xu Qing frowned slightly but didn't respond. Instead, he directed the soul of the Sea Corpse Race he had killed and absorbed into his 29th magic aperture.At the same time, he headed straight for the Sea Corpse Race member who was injured by the black iron stick and was rapidly retreating. He spoke his first words in this battle."If you don't want to die here, stop Black Robe!"Xu Qing didn't even look at the black-robed scholar from the Sea Corpse Race and headed straight for the injured Sea Corpse Race member.  Best novel online free at ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  He was very clear that in the current situation, regardless of whether he chose to destroy the teleportation array or kill the black-robed scholar, it would be slow. If he went to destroy the teleportation array, he would be blocked by Black Robe, while killing the Black Robe would waste time..Black Robe wasn't a weakling and his thoughts clearly ran deep. Xu Qing didn't want to fight such an opponent in the current situation. He would face him after getting Mystic Brilliance Form.The best choice for him now was for the cultivator of the Third Peak to stop Black Robe and him to kill the second Sea Corpse Race member as quickly as possible. He would devour and absorb the soul and open the 30th magic aperture to form his life fire.Xu Qing had a lot of combat experience. He had accumulated it since he was young in the slums. Through the countless killings and fights, he had long gained sharp senses and judgment.He quickly approached the second Sea Corpse Race member.This Sea Corpse Race cultivator was a nonhuman when he was alive. His nose was very long like an elephant's nose. Xu Qing had encountered such a cultivator on Sea Lizard Island before. Xu Qing didn't stop at all when he got close and immediately attacked.Immediately, a rumbling sound echoed.At the same time, Black Robe's expression also changed as he rapidly weighed the pros and cons in his mind. He didn't quite understand Xu Qing's actions. The only reason he could guess was that the other party was about to achieve his Mystic Brilliance Form.That was why this Seven Blood Eyes' disciple didn't escape despite knowing that he was in danger. Instead, he went to kill another Sea Corpse Race member.However, what Black Robe didn't understand was that even if the other party activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, there would still be a gap between him and an experienced Foundation Building cultivator like Lord Yunchen who was about to arrive.After all, the duration of the Mystic Brilliance Form was determined by the number of magic apertures.He didn't have the time to think too much. No matter what, he just needed to stop what the other party wanted to do.Perhaps no one who could cultivate to the Foundation Building realm was a fool. Black Robe wasn't stupid, Xu Qing wasn't stupid, and the youth from the Third Peak wasn't stupid either. He had only reacted a little slower previously.When he heard Xu Qing's words, although he didn't understand, he knew very well that it was unrealistic for him to stop the strong Sea Corpse Race's black-robed man.He couldn't stop him. As for escaping, it wasn't that he hadn't considered it.However, as long as the Sea Corpse Race's Mystic Brilliance Form Foundation Building cultivator successfully teleported, it would be too late even if he escaped this area and transmitted his message for help.He knew how terrifying the Mystic Brilliance Form was.If he did nothing now and fled, the probability of him dying was very high.If he went all out, he might have a chance of survival.After these thoughts raced through his mind, determination appeared in his eyes.He realized that there was only one way with the highest probability to save his life.He gritted his teeth and performed a series of hand seals with both hands. He then pressed his forehead and activated the secret technique that belonged to his Third Peak.Immediately, the figure on his forehead turned over, revealing the face of a woman.This face was pale and blood flowed out of its seven orifices. It was a bizarre sight. The instant it turned over, it seemed to be walking out from the glabella of the youth.It grew larger and larger until it separated from his body and floated out.As soon as this bizarre image appeared, it charged straight ahead. The direction it headed wasn't toward Black Robe but toward the teleportation array that was flickering with energy.The youth from the third peak wanted to let the bizarre entity destroy this teleportation array.This way, he could resolve all dangers.The only obstacle for this was Black Robe, but this could also be considered as fulfilling the request of the Seventh Peak's cultivator.By doing this, not only did he avoid the possibility of the Seventh Peak's cultivator framing him, but he also fulfilled the other party's cooperation requirements to a certain extent. At the same time, there was a high chance that Black Robe wouldn't pursue him but protect the teleportation array.This way, he could successfully escape.If the teleportation array really activated, the Seven Peak's disciple would be the first target."I'll gamble!" The youth from the Third Peak gritted his teeth and left rapidly without turning his head. He didn't hesitate to burn his magic apertures for faster speed.The battlefield was ever-changing and the speed of one's thoughts would often decide everything when the difference in cultivation levels wasn't too great. At this moment, when the youth from the Third Peak fled and released the bizarre entity that headed straight for the teleportation array, the expression of the black-robed scholar from the Sea Corpse Race changed. He felt a little troubled.To him, the most important thing was naturally the successful arrival of Lord Yunchen. Hence, he could only give up on Xu Qing and the youth from the Third Peak and head straight for the teleportation array.He instantly got close and used all his strength to stop the bizarre entity. A rumbling sound echoed.Xu Qing wasn't surprised by the Third Peak's cultivator's choice. He charged toward the Sea Corpse Race cultivator whose expression had changed drastically. No matter how the other party struggled or controlled the statue artifact to suppress him, it was useless.At the next instant, the black iron stick found a chance and directly pierced the statue, crazily absorbing it. The Diamond Sect's ancestor knew that there were outsiders around now, so he didn't appear. However, he didn't show any mercy when absorbing the artifact energy.However, he knew that he had to control himself. Otherwise, if it affected Demon Xu's spirit stones, he would suffer.Hence, as he continued to move around the statue, after devouring 70% of it, he suppressed his greed and gave up.The shadow was the same. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was paying attention, it pounced over crazily and hugged the thigh of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator, sucking fiercely.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator let out a mournful cry and his entire right leg instantly turned to ashes. His eyes revealed intense fear and he wanted to retreat but he couldn't do so at all. Xu Qing's dagger was already rapidly slashing at him.This Sea Corpse cultivator was also a ruthless person. Realizing his death was near, the fear in his eyes was replaced by madness and half of the magic apertures in his body exploded.With the help of the astonishing power obtained from the explosion of half of his magic apertures, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator shook off the shadow and dodged the black iron stick. He even dodged Xu Qing's dagger and rapidly retreated.He was about to escape.At the same time, the youth from the Third Peak had completely escaped from this area and could not be seen. The bizarre entity he left behind also became increasingly blurry due to the distance. Finally, it dissipated under the attack of the black-robed scholar. After dealing with the bizarre entity, the black-robed scholar looked at Xu Qing. He noticed that Xu Qing was chasing after his companion and was about to head over.However, at this instant, the body of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator who was fleeing in front of Xu Qing trembled violently. His insides churned and he spat out a large mouthful of black blood.The blood of the Sea Corpse Race was blue.However, what he spat out was black. It was poisoned blood!This poison wasn't spread by Xu Qing but was smeared on the black iron stick by Xu Qing under the pleading of the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Earlier, when the black iron stick pierced through the space between the Sea Corpse Race's forehead, the poison had already spread.However, it would take time for it to act up. Hence, after half of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's magic apertures had collapsed and his body was weakening, the poison acted up.The instant the poison acted up, daggers formed by black flames rapidly flew over from not far away. They stirred up a torrent as they stabbed the Sea Corpse Race cultivator.There were a total of six daggers. One attacked his neck, one pierced his heart, one went for his forehead, and one for each of his three limbs!As piercing sounds rang out, the body of the Sea Corpse Race was lifted by the power of the six daggers and nailed to the side. The shadow and the black iron stick also arrived rapidly.The black iron stick rapidly penetrated through the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's body many times while the shadow headed straight for the other leg.Amidst his mournful cries, the daggers on his body also transformed into black flames that rapidly covered his entire body. Xu Qing didn't bother with the black-robed scholar who was approaching. He arrived in front of the heavily injured Sea Corpse Race member and immediately pressed his right hand against the mouth of the Sea Corpse Race member.The fiendish fire surged in along his hand. With a single breath, the soul of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator flowed into his body. Under Xu Qing's excitement and anticipation, it turned into firewood and charged intensely toward his 30th magic aperture‚Ä¶Boom!Xu Qing's body trembled as his 30th magic aperture opened!Following the 30th magic aperture's opening, the 30 magic apertures in his body fused into one.The magic power that was emitted transformed into threads of flames that continuously gathered at Xu Qing's dantian.The 30 fire threads quickly formed a small ball.It continued to condense, burn, and shine until‚Ä¶The first ball of life fire that represented a true Foundation Building cultivator was completely formed!This life fire was glorious and emitted an incomparably clear light. The instant it was formed, all the spirit seas in Xu Qing's 30 magic apertures stirred up monstrous waves.Waves of astonishing fluctuations surged crazily, and his life fire burned intensely.The flames became even more dazzling!It illuminated the 30 magic apertures extremely clearly and even illuminated the Heavenly Palace that was faintly discernible in his body.At the same time, a powerful aura erupted from Xu Qing's body.At this moment, in Xu Qing's eyes, the world was different!Everything in the surroundings changed completely.Everything slowed down.The seawater, the collapsing surroundings, and the black-robed scholar in the distance was the same.The other party continued to move closer but in Xu Qing's eyes, his movements became extremely slow.It was so slow that Xu Qing felt very uncomfortable. He even saw countless specks of dust in front of him.This dust formed a shape in his eyes, as though it could be magnified infinitely with his thoughts.Microscopic observation!Not only that, but as the life fire in his body burned, a terrifying force that even Xu Qing was shocked rose and spread throughout his body!His spells were enhanced, and his body seemed to have been refined to a higher level. His soul felt like it was wearing armor. Everything about him was‚Ä¶ completely different from before.Before this, Xu Qing already knew that forming a life fire would be different from when there was no life fire. Now that he had personally entered this state, he understood that he had underestimated the difference between the two.It was like two different cultivation realms!After activating the Mystic Brilliance Form, his 30 magic apertures seemed to have transformed into 30 stoves that were being crazily consumed.The life fire condensed from such a huge consumption was so bright and majestic that it made Xu Qing feel as though a huge stove was burning in his body!The Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled, and his eyes revealed intense envy and desire. As for the shadow, it was also trembling. It was as though the light on Xu Qing's body at this moment made it very uncomfortable.However‚Ä¶ Xu Qing's breakthrough wasn't over.At the instant everything in the surroundings slowed down in his eyes and the instant the teleportation array in the distance was about to finish activating, Xu Qing moved his life fire to‚Ä¶ the wick of the black life lantern!At the next instant, the bottom of the sea rumbled and the seawater around Xu Qing exploded crazily in all directions. A horrifying aura erupted monstrously in Xu Qing's body!The life lantern was lit!The terrifying power that surpassed the strength of a ball of life fire instantly exploded from the life lantern and swept crazily toward all the meridians and flesh in Xu Qing's body.Wherever it passed, it was as though life itself was moving forward!Xu Qing's body trembled intensely as heavenly lightning rumbled in his body. It was no longer a stove but an erupting volcano!!The aura was so strong that it could destroy everything and terrify all existences!At this moment, the teleportation array in the distance was also activated.The Mystic Brilliance Form Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race let out a sinister laugh as his figure quickly formed in the teleportation array that could no longer be stopped."Human brat, you can't stop my descent this time. You'll definitely die‚Ä¶ Hmm?"
