In the sky, Lord Sixth was laughing.However, this laughter carried a heart-wrenching sadness, indescribable sorrow, and also the madness that had been suppressed for many years.Under Lord Sixth's attack, the Starfish Race's ancestor's body collapsed many times.Although this Starfish Race's ancestor's divine power was strange and his body could actually regenerate after collapsing time and time again, it was also this regeneration that made Lord Sixth even more crazy in his attacks.Clearly, the more pain his enemy felt and the more the enemy wailed, the more killing intent he felt.He sliced the Starfish Race's ancestor alive. Flesh and blood scattered down and were burned into ashes by the blue flames.However, it was not enough to resolve the hatred in his heart.On the ground, Xu Qing's eyes were completely red.He also went crazy from killing.From the place he landed to the Starfish Race's ancestral temple, all the Starfish Race members he encountered couldn't escape death!!Xu Qing lifted his right hand and a fiendish fire dagger instantly formed. He took a step forward and arrived in front of a Starfish Race cultivator, ruthlessly slitting his neck.As his head flew up, Xu Qing walked in front of another Starfish Race cultivator.He stabbed the cultivator's chest again and again. Finally, he threw the dagger to the side, landing on the neck of the third Starfish Race member. After it pierced through, Xu Qing caught the dagger and slashed.Immediately, the head fell off. Among the fallen corpses, Xu Qing once again saw the broken thread-like worms.There were many of these small worms. Some were entangled together, while others were alone. They looked very strange.Almost every Starfish Race cultivator's body contained it. Xu Qing had seen too many of them on his way here. There were even a few that tried to enter his body.However, these worms couldn't break the defense of his powerful body and were burned by the black flames.However, these worms had tenacious vitality. The flames only caused them to contract and distort but couldn't burn them to death immediately.In the end, the Golden Crow devoured them and completely killed them.Xu Qing also realized that other than being strange, these worms seemed to be able to affect the will and soul of the Starfish Race cultivators. This was because he had clearly seen these insects flash past the eyes of the Starfish Race cultivators a few times.Every time they appeared in their eyes, the Starfish Race cultivators would go crazy and rush over fearlessly.At the same time, Xu Qing sensed that the souls he devoured were incomplete as though they had been mostly devoured before this.Even the origin power gained from them was the same. Although the Golden Crow had absorbed some of their origin power, it wasn't much.It was as though the entire Starfish Race looked normal on the surface but in reality, most of their internal substances had been devoured by some kind of power."Lord Sixth is right. There is indeed a great secret behind the changes in the Starfish Race." Xu Qing thought of Lord Sixth's words but this wasn't important to him at this moment.Xu Qing's body swayed and the Golden Crow behind him rushed out, enveloping the six Starfish cultivators who charged at him. At the same time, the black iron stick pierced through the bodies of one cultivator after another in the distance.Every time it pierced through, it would emit lightning that destroyed all life force.As for the shadow, it was the same. In the area it covered, many of the Starfish Race's cultivators' shadows had eyes that opened and were devouring crazily. Many times, before it finished devouring, the enemies would be killed by Xu Qing and the Diamond Sect's ancestor.However, it didn't give up. In the end, there were still people it successfully controlled. The people it controlled would rush toward other Starfish Race members while laughing, and self-destruct.However, these… weren't Xu Qing's sharpest cards in killing. What truly shocked the captain who was following behind was the black fog around Xu Qing.The black fog formed by the little black bugs spread out around Xu Qing. Wherever they passed, everything would be devoured. Regardless of whether it was the coral trees or the Starfish Race cultivators, as long as they were touched by the black fog, they would be crazily torn and devoured.All kinds of mournful cries continuously came out from the black fog. Even those thread-like worms were food for the little black bugs. However, they were not able to devour the worms smoothly and required a lot of effort.No matter what, the accumulated depression in Xu Qing's heart was completely released on the battlefield. He continued forward and killed all the way. In the end, when he finally arrived at the Starfish Race's ancestral temple, his entire body was covered in blood and there were countless corpses behind him.Outside the ancestral temple, four figures sat cross-legged. These four figures slowly lifted their heads, revealing faces that were covered in veins. They were also from the Starfish Race but there were some differences. Firstly, their auras. The auras of these four people surpassed three fires, but didn't seem to have reached four fires.Next was the veins on their faces. These veins were all squirming, and looked like worms swimming around.The moment they looked at Xu Qing, Xu Qing saw a middle-aged cultivator sitting in front of a pill furnace in the ancestral temple and refining pills.This middle-aged cultivator wore a green robe that was embroidered with golden threads, forming a complicated pattern and there was an item that looked like an emperor's crown on his head.The fluctuations of the Golden Core cultivation base was constantly spreading from his body. There was a mark of a starfish between his brows. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ This middle-aged cultivator's expression was dignified. Even though there was a crazed slaughter going on outside and the race was facing calamity, he didn't seem to be moved. He continued to refine pills.It was as though to him, even if the entire race was gone, it wasn't a big deal. As long as the medicinal pills in this pill furnace were refined, it would be fine.He was the patriarch of the Starfish Race and the son of the Starfish Race's ancestor who was in an extremely miserable state in the air.Almost at the instant Xu Qing's gaze landed on the Starfish Race's patriarch and the killing intent in his heart soared, the four Starfish Race cultivators outside the ancestral temple stood up one after another.Their eyes were cold and without emotions. White threads as thick as chopsticks were swimming in their pupils.They immediately entered Mystic Brilliance Form with the combat strength of three fires as they headed straight for Xu Qing from different directions.The instant they got close, huge sarcomas bulged out from their backs and transformed into starfish. It seemed to have stimulated their bodies, causing the four of them to let out low roars in unison and punch out at Xu Qing!The instant these punches were thrown, the surroundings distorted from their might.Xu Qing didn't dodge. He stood on the spot and closed his eyes. At the next instant, the Golden Crow behind him let out a cry and bent down to envelop Xu Qing's body. Its black feathers transformed into a black emperor's robe, and the flames of its tail transformed into a cloak. When it lifted its head, it was as though it was putting the emperor's crown on Xu Qing.The violent intent coupled with a domineering aura caused Xu Qing to appear like a young emperor at this moment. His eyes opened.The four Starfish Race members around him all trembled violently. Their punches couldn't shake the Golden Crow at all. They even suffered a backlash and had to retreat.However, it was too late. As Xu Qing opened his eyes, he took a step forward and arrived in front of one cultivator. He ignored the other party's Mystic Brilliance Form and grabbed the other party's neck, ruthlessly squeezing it. The instant the neck broke, the black iron stick whistled over and crazily pierced through the cultivator's body seven to eight times.Xu Qing let go of the cultivator. The tail flame cloak on his back swayed and he transformed into a rainbow, appearing before another Starfish Race cultivator who was rapidly retreating. He directly collided with the cultivator.The Starfish cultivator let out a mournful cry, but kept on retreating. However, Xu Qing was much faster. He collided again and the Starfish cultivator's head instantly exploded.This wasn't the end. At this moment, the fog formed by a large number of black bugs had already filled the body of the third retreating Starfish cultivator. They had already begun devouring him.As mournful cries spread from the fog, Xu Qing had already arrived in front of the last Starfish Race cultivator. Amidst the other party's horror and despair, the Golden Crow on Xu Qing's body rushed out. Immediately, fiendish fire erupted and burned the cultivator.All of this happened in an instant. In the blink of an eye, the four people from the Starfish Race died. Their qi and blood, their souls, and their flesh were devoured.However, it was a pity that they were like a piece of meat that had been refrigerated for many years before being unsealed. They had no nutrients or taste.Xu Qing waved his hand and all the corpses in the surroundings dissipated, turning into ashes. Some passed by his eyes, but they couldn't divert Xu Qing's attention.His gaze was fixed on the Patriarch of the Starfish Race who was refining pills beside the pill furnace in the ancestral temple.At the same time, the captain's figure walked over from behind Xu Qing and stood beside him. He held an apple that had turned black for some reason. As he ate it, he looked at the patriarch."Wow, Junior Brother, look at this person. He looks like he's dead."The captain smiled.The instant he spoke, the eyes of the Starfish Race's patriarch beside the pill furnace suddenly opened. A divine light shone from his eyes like lightning!At the next instant, Xu Qing's mind rumbled and a huge sense of oppression assaulted him like a storm. However, the pendant hanging on his neck flashed and this pressure instantly dissipated.The captain also took a few steps back. Runes flickered in his eyes and there was a hint of madness on them. He licked his lips and showed his teeth that still had some black flesh of the apple between them."Xu Qing, let's attack together."Xu Qing nodded. At the next instant, the two of them headed straight for the Starfish Race's patriarch in the ancestral temple.A strange glint appeared in the Golden Core cultivator's eyes as he suddenly laughed."Interesting. I didn't expect to see small fries like you who still dare to charge over after encountering a Golden Core.""There's still time, so I'll play with you guys."

Chapter 300 Ice And Fire Duo Fiends
The moment the captain and Xu Qing rushed over, the Starfish Race's patriarch's voice spread out. He stood up and took a step forward.The instant his foot landed on the ground, overlapping shadows appeared on his body. It was as though two lumps of illusory vengeful spirits were rising in his body and were released to the left and right.At the next instant, the Starfish Race's patriarch's body directly split into two identical bodies that rushed toward the captain and Xu Qing.His speed was so fast that he instantly approached Xu Qing. He lifted his right index finger and pressed it on Xu Qing's glabella.A mocking smile appeared on his face. As his finger landed, a monstrous might erupted from it. There was also the power of the Golden Core that suppressed the surroundings, causing Xu Qing's body to tremble. The life fires in his body seemed to be blown by a violent wind and were about to be extinguished.At this moment, the black iron stick whistled closer and tried to interrupt the Starfish Race's patriarch. However, the latter flicked it slightly.The black iron stick was sent flying. There were even some cracks on it. After that, the Starfish Race's patriarch stomped fiercely on the ground.The ground rumbled and the shadow that appeared under his feet instantly dissipated."That's it?"The Starfish Race's patriarch shook his head and pointed his index finger at Xu Qing's forehead. Just as his finger was about to land, the Golden Crow behind Xu Qing manifested and sucked fiercely at him.The Starfish Race's patriarch's body paused. He turned a little blurry but he still continued to press his forehead toward Xu Qing's forehead. However, the moment he pressed it down, the Golden Crow's flames also ruthlessly swept over.Xu Qing's eyes were filled with madness. He didn't dodge at all and used his head to collide with the finger.The Golden Crow seemed to have used up a lot of energy as it turned a little dim but it was able to forcefully absorb a trace of qi and blood. Xu Qing's forehead also collided with the Starfish Race Patriarch's finger with all his might.The Starfish Race's patriarch's eyes revealed a strange light as his finger broke.As for Xu Qing, his body was thrown into the distance. The protective barrier from the pendant outside his body prevented him from suffering any injuries. Only the qi and blood in his body churned under the tremors. However, he quickly stood up and stared fixedly at the Starfish Race's patriarch whose strange expression had turned into surprise.On the other side, the captain was facing the other body of the Starfish Race's patriarch. The other party also lifted his finger and pressed between his brows. However, the captain's solution was different from Xu Qing's.The runic seals in his eyes were instantly undone and the aura of his entire body continued to erupt. Just like Xu Qing, he didn't dodge and chose to advance instead of retreating.What was different was that he didn't use his head to knock into the finger. Instead, he opened his mouth and bit at the other party's finger with endless madness in his eyes!All of this took a long time to describe but in reality, it happened at the same time. The Starfish Race's patriarch split into two bodies and attacked Xu Qing and the captain at the same time.At the next instant, the Starfish Race's patriarch's finger was bitten by the captain. Although it wasn't bitten off, the teeth bit through its flesh, causing blood to flow out of the finger.As for the captain, a few of his teeth shattered and he retreated. However, his eyes were still filled with madness. He performed a series of hand seals with both hands and took out a shield. After blocking the power of the Golden Core, he was thrown far away."Interesting." The two bodies of the Starfish Race's patriarch lowered their heads and looked at their fingers. The two bodies instantly fused together. After they became one again, the injuries on their fingers instantly recovered.His Golden Core cultivation was fully displayed. Xu Qing's eyes stung and his entire body was trembling. He felt as though the sun was attacking him but killing intent still rose in his eyes.The captain was the same. Although he was missing a few teeth, it seemed to be more convenient for him to stick out his tongue and lick his lips. He even had the mood to grin at Xu Qing with a smug expression.The Starfish Race's patriarch let out a cold snort and took a step forward, heading straight for the captain. However, after he took less than three steps, his expression suddenly changed.At this moment, a black color appeared on his finger that had completely healed. It was as though a large amount of poison was spreading throughout his body.If someone could see into his body, they would see a large number of small black bugs there.They were crazily biting and devouring the Sea Corpse Race Patriarch's body, emitting a large amount of anomalous substances and powerful poison. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ This was the result of Xu Qing and the captain's cooperation.Xu Qing was very clear about the captain's habit of attacking. After all, the captain bit the statue of the Sea Corpse Race's Ancestral Corpse Statue and also did the same with the Golden Core Octopus. Hence, when the captain was eating the apple earlier, Xu Qing controlled the little black bugs to go over.When the captain sensed them, he didn't care. He allowed those little black bugs to hide between his teeth. Just now, when he bit through the flesh of the finger, the little black bugs successfully entered the patriarch's body.The instant the expression of the Starfish Race's patriarch changed, the captain laughed sinisterly. The madness in his eyes intensified as he rushed toward the other party. Xu Qing was the same.As he rushed out, the shadow under Xu Qing's feet spread out and enveloped the surroundings, forming a domain. At the same time, all the lightning runes on the black iron stick erupted. The Golden Crow behind Xu Qing let out a loud cry.He ignited the life lantern and life fires in his body, and circulated his physical strength to the extreme. He then punched out with all his might at the Starfish Race's patriarch!Xu Qing had thrown out everything in this punch. He had gathered the power of his life fires and life lantern, the power of the Golden Crow, and all the eruptions of the 60-odd magic apertures in his body. Everything was gathered on this punch. The instant he threw it out, a storm stirred in the surroundings.It transformed into a sea of fire that surged into the sky!That was the fire of the Golden Crow, the fire of the life lantern, as well as the fire of his magic power, life fires, and his fury!The seals in the captain's eyes were undone one after another, and gradually, the temperature of the surroundings decreased to an extremely low degree. The ground was frozen, and snowflakes appeared in the surroundings.These snowflakes emitted an astonishing chill that even surpassed many bizarre entities. It seemed to be able to freeze even senses and will.In fact, even the sky changed at this moment. An endless cold air towered into the sky from the captain's body, forming a clear contrast with Xu Qing's heat.This fire and ice headed straight for the Starfish Race's patriarch from two directions and arrived instantly.The madness in the captain's eyes intensified. A hand strangely stretched out from his chest!This hand was an ice hand. It was blue and didn't look like a human's hand. It was covered in sharp bone spikes and had a face on its palm.That face was none other than the captain's. However, his eyes were closed as though he was in a deep sleep.The appearance of this hand caused the eyes of the Starfish Race's patriarch to narrow and he tried to dodge. However, the little black bugs in his body erupted crazily and self-destructed one by one, forming even denser anomalous substances and poison, causing the Starfish Race's patriarch to involuntarily pause.The instant he paused, the hand that stretched out from the captain's chest pressed on the forehead of the Starfish Race's patriarch.With a boom, an endless cold erupted. The Starfish Race's patriarch was directly frozen. In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing's all-out attack that had stirred up an endless sea of fire enveloped him. He also used this opportunity to take out the calligraphy of the ancestor."Light!"In an instant, the word light from 'light the nose' transformed into a green fire that swept toward the Starfish Race's patriarch with supreme might.The killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes was intense. His fist that had all his strength concentrated on it smashed into the frozen body of the Starfish Race's patriarch.As the punch landed, cracks instantly appeared on the Starfish Race's patriarch's body that was surrounded by flames. The fire from the ancestor was too powerful. As it enveloped him, the sound of burning spread in all directions.The body of the Starfish Race's patriarch was burning at a speed visible to the naked eye and was dissipating. However, the strange thing was that there was no fear in his eyes at all. Instead, intense surprise appeared in them."The words of a great expert!"At the next instant, the Starfish Race's patriarch's body dissipated. However, the instant his body shattered, a tentacle as thick as an arm stretched out from his collapsed body and ruthlessly lashed out at Xu Qing and the captain.This force caused the void to collapse like a mirror shattering. The terrifying soul-shattering power engulfed Xu Qing and the captain and they couldn't help but move back.At this critical moment, Xu Qing pulled the captain to his side and used the pendant Lord Sixth had given him to block this violent impact. The two of them retreated 1000 feet away and each spat out a mouthful of blood from the injuries to their internal organs. They quickly lifted their heads and looked at the place where the tentacles appeared.Over there… as the dust dissipated, a figure could be faintly seen walking out step by step.Silver tentacles danced around the figure. Occasionally, a few of them would rush out of the dust, revealing themselves clearly.They weren't tentacles but thick worms. They revealed their sharp teeth and let out sinister cries at Xu Qing and the captain!Very soon, the figure in the dust completely walked out and was reflected in Xu Qing and the captain's eyes!This was a nonhuman with a body that was more than ten feet tall. Its entire body was silver and it had a triangular head. Its eyes had double pupils and its tongue was very long. Its entire body was covered in waving worms.As it appeared, a terrifying fluctuation that shook Xu Qing and the captain to the core erupted from its body. Dense divine power spread out, distorting all the space in the surroundings.This wasn't a Golden Core but a Nascent Soul!As its aura erupted, the sky changed color and the wind and clouds churned. Xu Qing and the captain had no choice but to retreat again."I didn't expect to see two good sparrows in this small land. One of them has a level four bizarre entity sealed in his body, while the other has an emperor-level cultivation art, strange abilities, and words of a great expert."A cold voice slowly came out from the strange nonhuman's mouth.When Xu Qing heard this, his eyes narrowed but he heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. The other party had clearly only seen a portion of him. It didn't see the life lantern, his shadow, or the purple crystal.As for the captain at the side, he also heaved a sigh of relief. His thoughts were similar to Xu Qing's…By some coincidence, the two sensed that the other seemed to be relieved. They looked at each other.

Chapter 301 Illuminate's Bai Li
"What race is this?" Xu Qing spoke while retreating."The world of Wanggu is too large. There are all kinds of races. This seems to be a type of worm race. I vaguely remember reading about them in a file in the Intelligence Department. Let me think about it."The captain looked a little puzzled but he also retreated.Seeing Xu Qing and the captain fleeing, the nonhuman formed from the Starfish Race's patriarch's body grinned and his body suddenly swayed.Xu Qing's expression darkened and the captain's eyes narrowed. However, with their speed, it was difficult for them to escape in front of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Xu Qing only felt his vision blur and an instant later, a rumbling sound rang out. Divine power rushed at his face and an irresistible force surged. His entire body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood. It was the same for the captain.However, with the protection of Xu Qing's pendant, although they were thrown a thousand feet away by the divine power, they were still fine. It was just that the internal organs in their bodies were churning as though they were being torn apart. If the other party continued to attack, the pendant's protection wouldn't be able to last for long.Just as the nonhuman figure was about to attack again, the sky rumbled and blue flames suddenly fell, blocking the nonhuman.The sea of blue flames from the sky had killed a large number of the people on the Starfish Race's island.However, when these Starfish Race's members died, thread-like worms would crawl out of their corpses. This strange scene had long attracted the attention of the Sixth Peak's disciples and Lord Sixth.The scene of the Starfish Race's patriarch transforming was naturally seen by Lord Sixth. Hence, after suppressing the Starfish Race's ancestor with a slap, he performed a series of hand seals and attacked, causing the blue sea of fire to descend to stop the nonhuman."He's from the Iron Thread Race!" At the same time, Lord Sixth's voice spread in all directions.When the captain heard these three words, his expression changed and he quickly spoke in a low voice."Xu Qing, I remember now…"The nonhuman who wanted to torture and kill Xu Qing and the captain lifted its head and looked at the sky when it heard this. It suddenly smiled. Read m0re at nOνEℓn(E)Xт  "It seems I've underestimated the sects here a little. However, you're just a Nascent Soul cultivator. Are you even worthy of disturbing my cultivation?" The nonhuman raised its right hand and pointed at the sky.Immediately, the weather changed and the sound of war drums and thunder rang out from the sky. The rumbling sound was like the roar of a god. The instant it spread, three huge array formation halos appeared in the sky.Each of these three array formation halos was a thousand feet long and emitted vast might. An astonishing teleportation power erupted from them.Figures appeared from these three teleportation arrays.What appeared from the first teleportation array was a group of nonhuman cultivators with wings on their backs. They were pitch-black and looked like crows.Their appearance was imposing and ferocious, especially the one at the front. Its gaze was like lightning and its entire body emitted terrifying fluctuations of Nascent Soul cultivation.This wasn't the end. Amidst the rumbling of the second teleportation array, another large group of figures appeared. They all had human bodies and elephant noses. Every one of them was extremely tall and emitted dense vitality.The burly man in front also emitted the fluctuations of a Nascent Soul cultivator. His expression was sinister and incomparably savage.The third teleportation array was also the same. At this moment, as it rumbled and rotated, a large number of figures flew out wildly. Their appearances were even stranger, like seaweed with triangular eyes. Just their movements alone stirred up a terrifying storm.Nascent Soul fluctuation also spread from the group.As soon as these three races appeared, the eyes of the captain beside Xu Qing narrowed slightly."Six-Winged Black Crow Race, Strength Elephant Cloud Race, and Snake Grass Demon Plant Race!""These three races aren't large races and are on the same scale as the Starfish Race. Among them, the Six-Winged Black Crow Race is an ally of the Seven Blood Eyes. The other two races are neutral."The three great races didn't say a word and directly headed straight for Lord Sixth. Many of their members even slammed into the Sixth Peak's mountain!They didn't fear death and wanted to use their lives to shake the mountain. If one took a closer look, they would see thread-like bugs flashing past their eyes.These three races, including the Starfish Race, were all controlled!Lord Sixth was covered from all sides. Xu Qing sped up again and the captain also moved at full speed. If it was an early-stage Golden Core cultivator, they could still give it a try, but the other party was a Nascent Soul cultivator. This wasn't something they could resist.Even though there was the calligraphy from the ancestor, unless it was a critical moment, it was better to use it as a deterrent."I want to see how many times your protection can withstand my attacks."The Nascent Soul nonhuman smiled faintly and was about to chase after them when the captain suddenly turned his head and stared at the nonhuman."You're Bai Li!""Iron Thread Race's Bai Li!"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed and the nonhuman Nascent Soul exclaimed in surprise.He found it interesting when he was called out by the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord and felt that the other party had some knowledge. However, he found it unbelievable for his name to be called out by a low-level cultivator."I really didn't expect someone in this small place to know me. You're quite interesting.""Sixty years ago, the Iron Thread Race's Bai Li was a peerless genius. He was known as the chosen seed who would walk the path of the ancient kings and sovereigns.""For some reason, he suddenly rebelled. Not only did he kill his blood relatives, but he also caused chaos in the race. He tainted the Iron Thread Race's holy item and caused a calamity, causing the deaths of countless clansmen. He then defected and joined a mysterious organization called Illuminate!"The captain slowly spoke."Interesting. You know quite a lot. Let me search your soul and see what else you know."Bai Li's expression was filled with surprise. He took a step forward and neared the captain. The captain's eyes flickered with blue light and Xu Qing also revealed madness as he took out the ancestor's calligraphy.Just as they were about to attack, a cold snort rang out from the sky.This snort was louder than thunder and rumbled in all directions. The instant it rang out, a wine gourd suddenly rose above Lord Sixth's head.This wine gourd was something he had never let go of since the death of his wife and son.As soon as it appeared, streams of sharp baleful aura soared into the sky. They transformed into shadows of weapons that quickly manifested and shot out in all directions.These weapons were all-encompassing; there were sabers, spears, swords, halberds, axes, hooks, and forks everywhere. There were probably no less than a million of them and they formed a sea of weapons that destroyed everything in its path.It suppressed the three races.The Nascent Soul ancestors of the three races summoned by Bai Li were attacked by the sea of weapons and had nowhere to dodge. All of them spat out blood and let out mournful cries as their bodies were heavily injured. The members of the three races were also heavily injured. Under the impact of the sea of weapons and the baleful aura, their minds trembled and their expressions changed drastically.Most of their bodies shattered or were dismembered. Although the remaining ones didn't die immediately, they clearly couldn't hold on for long and their bodies began to show signs of heavy damages.In fact, there was even a gaze that vaguely appeared in the gourd. It looked at the nonhuman races with extreme ferocity and disdain.Boom!Clouds parted in the sky and the sea of weapons fell down in torrents. All the nonhumans in the air were in an extremely tragic state.As though he felt that it wasn't enough, Lord Sixth performed a series of hand seals and pointed at the Sixth Peak.Immediately, the flames of the Sixth Peak swept in all directions, completely enveloping the Starfish Race's land and all the fallen members of the three races.Burn everything and speed up the refinement."What magic artifact is this? There's so much metal-element baleful aura!!" For the first time, Bai Li's expression changed.At that moment, he couldn't be bothered to kill Xu Qing and the captain. His body swayed and he disappeared. However, it was obvious that teleportation here was restricted. He didn't appear far away, and only appeared in mid-air. His expression changed and he tried to escape."I was thinking about it previously. With how weak the Starfish Race is, how would they have the guts to do such a big thing? So it turns out that the mastermind behind it is a bastard from Illuminate which is active in the Wanggu Continent!"Lord Sixth's voice was filled with anger and killing intent. With a wave of his hand, the wine gourd above his head instantly formed a baleful aura storm that swept toward Bai Li.Bai Li's heart trembled. Just as he was about to escape, Lord Sixth had already approached on the waves of weapons and sent a palm strike.Bai Li, who realized that he couldn't escape, revealed a demonic glint in his eyes. He turned around and attacked, fighting against Lord Sixth in the sky.The attacks of the two people shook the sky and earth. The sounds from their attacks were deafening and spread in all directions, causing the surrounding cultivators who were watching to have no choice but to retreat far away.Xu Qing's expression was solemn. With the protection of the pendant, he stared at the battle.At the side, the captain suddenly laughed. As he laughed, his eyes were filled with madness and greed."I didn't expect to encounter the legendary Illuminate here… I heard that every member of this organization isn't simple."Xu Qing glanced at the captain."Illuminate is an extremely mysterious organization in the Wanggu Continent. It was born less than a thousand years ago and all the members are true heaven's chosen of the various races. The secret scroll of the Intelligence Department recorded that this organization announced to the outside world that they would share the opportunity to become a god to those who joined them. The condition for joining is to perform a blood performance on their race. The better this performance is, the more they will be recognized by Illuminate.""I heard that many years ago, someone in the Nanhuang Continent actually used the god opening His eyes as a performance and joined Illuminate." The captain smiled and looked at Xu Qing."It's a pity that they didn't look for me. Otherwise, I really would have joined in to take a look at what the opportunity to become a god is. Could it be a path of ancient kings and sovereigns, or is it truly becoming a god?""I don't believe it…""I don't believe it either." Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and touched the calligraphy. He then looked at Bai Li, who was fighting in the sky.

Chapter 302 Ancestor's Calligraphy Suppresses Nascent Soul (1)
Rumbling sounds kept on spreading. The battle between Lord Sixth and Bai Li was earth-shattering; the sky changed color, clouds parted, and terrifying waves surged into the sky.Their every strike seemed to be able to overturn mountains and rivers. In fact, just the aftershock of their divine arts coming into contact caused the surrounding void to shatter.Cracks continuously formed in the space around the two of them. From time to time, the space would collapse, forming a huge black hole that seemed to be able to devour everything.There were also bolts of lightning that were like heavenly punishment that kept swimming in the surroundings. They even transformed into horns that sent out battle cries and fought against each other.Not only that, but their figures also flickered continuously in the sky. One moment, they were fighting in close combat, and the next moment, they would be fighting with long range attacks.Storms were casually pinched by them and turned into their own divine abilities. Countless white thread-like worms drifted out of Bai Li's body, and every one of them distorted and assumed the shape of runes, forming streams of Great Yin Mystic Lightning that shot toward Lord Sixth.Upon closer inspection, those black lightning bolts were formed by countless worms. They would explode as soon as they got close to Lord Sixth. In fact, some of the spatial cracks that had just formed were frozen in the next instant.  🅣🅗🅘🅢 🅒🅗🅐🅟🅣🅔🅡 🅤🅟🅛🅞🅐🅓 🅕🅘🅡🅢🅣 🅐🅣 🅝🅞🅥🅔🅛-🅑🅘🅝.🅒🅞🅜  From afar, the spatial cracks that were frozen looked like white centipedes.As for Lord Sixth, he wasn't ordinary either. With a wave of his hand, the surroundings were filled with a sea of weapons that surged with killing intent.The aura it emitted contained the power to destroy the world.However, Bai Li was extremely extraordinary. Although his cultivation base was similar to Lord Sixth's and Lord Sixth even had the wine gourd… this Bai Li was still not at a disadvantage.After all, Lord Sixth's talent was in refining artifacts, not fighting.Amidst the rumbling, Bai Li teleported in front of Lord Sixth. He performed a series of hand seals and pointed. Immediately, a saber beam appeared out of thin air. The saber beam split the void, forming a huge crack that danced toward Lord Sixth. Lord Sixth's expression changed and he retreated.Seeing this, Bai Li suddenly laughed."As expected of a Nascent Soul cultivator from a small place. You have such a magic artifact, but still cannot kill me.""Since that's the case, I might not have to escape today. Killing you and snatching your top-grade magic artifact can be considered a great harvest as well."As he spoke, Bai Li slapped his forehead and his body instantly trembled. His back swelled up, forming a large bump that was filled with countless blood vessels and worms. The large flesh bump suddenly exploded.A plant grew out of it.This plant was a total of 30 feet long and extended above Bai Li's head. It was completely blood-colored and had six leaves with jagged edges. It also had a triangular flower with countless stamens!A large number of densely packed runes flowed like blood through the body of this strange plant. The moment it appeared, a powerful divine aura spread out.This aura was too strong, causing Xu Qing's eyes to sting. It was the same for the captain but the madness in his eyes grew."Divinity!!"What the plant emitted was divinity.Moreover, the density was extremely majestic. The instant it appeared, the plant lifted its head and shook its body at the wine gourd in the sky.A violent wind swept over, blowing down the swaying stamens of the triangular-shaped flower, revealing… a malevolent ghost face!This ghost face's eyes were red and looked extremely sinister. At that moment, it was grinning."Let's see if your top-grade magic artifact is stronger or my Illuminate Divine Seed!"Bai Li laughed loudly and waved his right hand. Immediately, medicinal pills flew out of his sleeve and headed straight for the face in the flower. These medicinal pills were semi-finished products. Moreover, their ingredients weren't any medicinal herbs but flesh and blood.One could see the shadows of dead souls on every pill. Every dead soul looked very young. Clearly, they were all heaven's chosen who had disappeared over these years.They were tortured and refined by Bai Li. He used their flesh and blood to refine pills and fused their souls into them, turning them into medicinal pills.He didn't refine these pills to consume them himself but to feed that evil plant, which was the divine seed he mentioned. However, the plant clearly required an extremely large amount, so he came to the Forbidden Sea.It was too dangerous to do this on the Wanggu Continent. However, here, he felt that he should be able to handle any danger with ease.As the medicinal pills were devoured by the plant, amidst Lord Sixth's furious roar and violent killing intent, the plant suddenly emitted a sound at the wine gourd in the sky!"Hong!"This sound was different from normal pronunciation. It was more like a spell and it gave off the feeling that it was clearly just a single tone but at the same time, it seemed to be a special sound formed by the fusion of countless sounds.As soon as the sound was emitted, crackling sounds rang out from the sky. Streaks of red lightning directly appeared on the wine gourd. These lightning bolts increased to countless numbers in the blink of an eye.The entire process only took a few breaths of time. At least hundreds of thousands of red lightning bolts appeared in the sky and enveloped the wine gourd, forming a huge runic mark.This extremely complicated runic mark transformed into a seal that weakened the might of the wine gourd.

Chapter 303 Ancestor's Calligraphy Suppresses Nascent Soul (2)
Bai Li laughed loudly again. With a wave of his hand, a huge body appeared in the air.This body was a thousand feet long and looked like a huge mantis. Its entire body was pitch-black, and the most shocking thing about it was its two extremely sharp saber legs.This body was like a combat vessel. The moment it appeared, Bai Li's body fused into it. In an instant, the eyes of the thousand-foot-long combat vessel opened, revealing a ferocious glint. It immediately headed straight for Lord Sixth.Its speed was so fast that it broke through the void and directly arrived in front of Lord Sixth and slashed down.Looking at this saber strike that looked like it could slash anything, Xu Qing's heart trembled violently. He recalled the saber strike in the temple.It was different but also similar. Lord Sixth used all his strength to block it, but was still thrown back, coughing up blood.However, he was still smiling sinisterly. The killing intent in his eyes didn't decrease at all."I'm not good at fighting, but… I'm the Peak Lord of the Sixth Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes. The Sixth Peak is good at refining artifacts, especially great magic artifacts!!"As he spoke, Lord Sixth grabbed at the Sixth Peak's mountain below."Come!"In an instant, the Sixth Peak's mountain that was refining the Starfish Race's island instantly blurred. When it became clear, it appeared in front of Lord Sixth.Divine power erupted from it and all the magic artifacts on the mountain rumbled. The aura of the entire mountain peak erupted and pressed down on Bai Li, who had fused into the combat vessel!"Suppress!"The power of a peak suppressed one person.The mountain's power formed a destructive force and sealed off the surroundings, leaving Bai Li with nowhere to hide. Bai Li's expression changed. As the mountain pressed down on him rapidly, he couldn't help but tremble.  🅣🅗🅘🅢 🅒🅗🅐🅟🅣🅔🅡 🅤🅟🅛🅞🅐🅓 🅕🅘🅡🅢🅣 🅐🅣 🅝🅞🅥🅔🅛-🅑🅘🅝.🅒🅞🅜  Cracks appeared on his vessel. Bai Li's eyes turned bloodshot as he brandished his two saber legs and soared into the sky toward the mountain. However, his existence was insignificant compared to the mountain.As the two sides came into contact and Lord Sixth performed a series of hand seals, the huge mountain suppressed Bai Li below and continued to descend toward the Starfish Race's land!Rumbling sounds spread everywhere. The ground quaked and Xu Qing and the captain's bodies swayed as they flew to the air to dodge. Huge cracks spread out on the island of the Starfish Race and it looked like it was about to collapse. The surrounding sea stirred up a tsunami that moved in all directions, affecting an extremely large area."I'll refine you!" Lord Sixth's hair was disheveled and his eyes were filled with madness. He quickly performed hand seals with both hands and kept pressing the mountain on the ground, causing a dense sea of fire to erupt from the mountain to speed up the refinement."You refined my son, I'll refine you!"The mountain emitted a tremor. Bai Li, who was suppressed below, was trying his best to prop it up and blast open the mountain peak that was suppressing him.Waves of soul-stirring divine power spread out from under the mountain, accompanied by roars like that of ferocious beasts.To Xu Qing and the captain's shock, the burning mountain was lifted bit by bit!To be able to do this with the strength of an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, this Bai Li was indeed a peerless genius of his race. After the mountain was lifted, a heavy roar rang out from below.Bai Li's appearance had changed drastically. He no longer was in the combat vessel but had fused with the evil plant on his back.It had thick branches, six jagged leaf hands, and countless tentacle-like roots that continued to spread on the ground. When it lifted the mountain high, the triangular flower with the face was revealed.This face was no longer the ghost face from before but Bai Li.A red glow flashed in his eyes and the divinity in his entire body soared crazily at an astonishing speed."This is the artifact refinement you're good at? I've seen many artifact refinement cultivators. Not only do they know how to refine, but they're also good at using it. As for you, I…"Before his arrogant speech could finish, Lord Sixth suddenly waved his hand and a huge flag appeared in the sky above his head and spread out.This flag was a thousand feet long and gave off a powerful and intimidating aura.From afar, the flag seemed to be incomplete and the colors on it were mixed, as though it was stained with countless blood. It emitted an intense sense of divinity.It was as though it had experienced the iteration of an era and experienced the baptism of countless wars. As it unfolded, it changed the color of the sky and covered the brilliance of the sun.All the races within tens of thousands of kilometers of the Starfish Island were shaken. Even the hidden existences at the bottom of the sea opened their eyes one after another, revealing fear.This was especially so when they felt the aura of a drop of golden blood on the flag. It gave off a feeling that it surpassed divinity and was infinitely close to the fragmented face of the god that looked down upon everything from the sky!It was as though countless divine creatures and countless nonhuman experts had been killed under this battle flag. Now that Lord Sixth took it out, a peerless ferocious intent that shook the world erupted from it.This aura was so strong that the sky froze and the waves of the sea stopped.Bai Li's voice stopped abruptly. At the next instant, an unprecedented struggle erupted from his plant body. His tone changed and was filled with horror, deep horror.

Chapter 304 Ancestor's Calligraphy Suppresses Nascent Soul (3)
"Human race's battle flag! How can such an item exist in such a small place!!"Clearly, he didn't know everything. At the very least, he didn't know that the Seven Blood Eyes had once displayed... this human race's battle flag on merfolk island!The appearance of the human race's battle flag frightened Bai Li out of his wits.He struggled with all his might to break free, and the Sixth Peak's mountain that was suppressing him rumbled and trembled under his struggle. Gradually, it showed signs of being unable to suppress him.A cold glint flashed in Lord Sixth's eyes as he performed hand seals with both hands. Immediately, the human race's battle flag shook, emitting waves of dazzling light that landed on the mountain.However, he wasn't Old Master Seventh and his cultivation was inferior. Hence, when he used the human race's battle flag, he couldn't be as fast and calm as Old Master Seventh back then.Lord Sixth needed time to unleash the strength of the human race's battle flag.Seeing this, determination appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He walked out. The captain's breathing was also hurried as he stared fixedly at Bai Li's body under the Sixth Peak. The madness in his eyes reached the extreme."Divinity! Such dense and pure divinity!! It doesn't have any anomalous substances!!!" The captain's eyes turned red.The two of them were extremely fast as they headed straight for the mountain. This area was filled with Bai Li's roars and divine power fluctuations. Low-level cultivators would die if they came into contact with these divine power fluctuations.However, Xu Qing had the protection of the pendant. The light barrier outside his body distorted intensely and he could barely hold on. As for the captain, it was equally difficult. Every time he took a step forward, he would vomit a mouthful of blood. However, he also had a shield outside his body that protected him.Xu Qing didn't bother with the captain. He stared at the rumbling mountain in front of him and then at Bai Li, who was lifting the mountain and trying to escape. He suddenly lifted his right hand; immediately, a large number of black bugs rushed toward Bai Li.However, the divinity coming from Bai Li's body was too strong. Before the little black bugs could get close, a large number of them died. Bai Li also sensed Xu Qing and the captain. However, he didn't have the time to care about them. With a low roar, he used more strength and lifted the mountain a little more before pushing it fiercely.The mountain was thrown dozens of feet away. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he immediately tried to make his escape. However, at this moment, a cold glint rose in Xu Qing's eyes. He held the ancestor's calligraphy in his right hand and clenched it ruthlessly.'Nose!' T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ The word 'light' was already blurry. At this moment, the word 'nose' instantly distorted and disappeared, transforming into a huge nose that moved toward Bai Li.Its speed was as fast as lightning and instantly got close.The instant Bai Li noticed it, the nose ruthlessly collided with him. An intense sound spread through the sky and Bai Li spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was forced back to the place where the mountain was falling and he missed his chance to escape. The mountain fell on him again.Boom! Bai Li let out a mournful roar. As he resisted the mountain with all his might, the blue flames from the mountain crazily burned and refined him."Damnable human insect!!" Bai Li gritted his teeth. The captain took advantage of this opportunity and rushed over recklessly.Even though his body and face were corroded by Bai Li's aura, he didn't care at all. He spared no expense and bit Bai Li's branch.Crack. Bai Li's entire body trembled. The captain let out a tragic cry and his body retreated. His lower body collapsed and one of his arms was shattered. Half of his body was gone, including an eye. His intestines were all over the ground and his mouth and teeth had shattered.However, there was a piece of Bai Li's flesh in his mouth that he forcefully swallowed. A mad and satisfied smile appeared on his face.Bai Li's anger burned as he roared at the sky. However, he was suppressed and couldn't counterattack. The attack earlier was an instinctive release of his power. The flames in the surroundings continued to weaken him, causing him to go completely crazy.His eyes were red and the divinity in his entire body erupted again. After pushing the mountain up, his body split into two. They fled in two directions, trying to leave the range of the mountain.However, at the next instant, Xu Qing, who had been staring at him the whole time, attacked. Immediately, the word 'the' blurred and formed a huge fist that headed straight for Bai Li.Xu Qing was about to continue using the calligraphy, but this fist didn't need to identify the real and fake Bai Li. It was as though it could lock onto the real Bai Li and landed on him amidst his despair.Bai Li's entire body trembled violently and spat out mouthfuls of blood. When his body was pushed back, the mountain he pushed up slammed down again due to inertia.Boom!Bai Li trembled. This time, he couldn't withstand it anymore and directly knelt down. Endless blue flames arrived crazily and continued to corrode him. At this moment, the captain actually rushed over again while using one hand to move. His speed was even faster than before. Just as he got close to Bai Li and was about to bite him, Bai Li suddenly turned his head and let out a sinister roar.The captain let out a blood-curdling scream. His body collapsed and his hand was gone. Only his head, which didn't have much flesh and blood, rolled out. Even so, he wasn't dead. His eyes were filled with unwillingness as he growled at Xu Qing."Throw me over, throw me over!!"

Chapter 305 Ancestor's Calligraphy Suppresses Nascent Soul (4)
Almost at the instant the captain spoke, Bai Li went crazy in this life-and-death crisis. He actually self-destructed. The fluctuations formed didn't spread in all directions but were gathered and attacked the mountain above.Amidst the impact, an iron thread worm flew out of the destroyed body. Taking advantage of the moment the mountain was pushed up, it fled into the distance.The iron thread worm no longer had the evil divine seed.Clearly, the price it had to pay was extremely heavy. However, in order to save its life, it had no choice. A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he used the last remaining word in the ancestor's calligraphy.<anno data-annotation-id="b2969299-d5d6-4179-a675-9a3ba2834141">"Light</anno>!"A huge palm appeared in front of Xu Qing and shot toward the fleeing iron thread worm. It instantly got close to the iron thread worm and slapped it.The iron thread worm Insect spat out a mouthful of broken teeth and half of its body collapsed. It let out a mournful cry and wanted to break out forcefully, but it was unable to do so, and was thrown back by this slap.It tried to change directions in midair and escape with all his might. However, the mountain smashed down again.This time, Bai Li was completely pressed down.Xu Qing heaved a sigh of relief in his mind. What followed was weakness surging in his entire body like a tide.With his cultivation, he wasn't able to display the full strength of the ancestor's calligraphy and the consumption was also extremely high. Fortunately, he had bought enough time for Lord Sixth.At that moment, in the sky, Lord Sixth waved his arms. His eyes were filled with killing intent, hatred, and madness as he ruthlessly pressed down on the mountain below!Immediately, a finger stretched out from the thousand-foot-long human race's battle flag.As soon as this finger appeared, the color of the world changed and the wind and clouds churned. A terrifying aura that could devour mountains and overturn seas spread out from this finger.It pressed down on the mountain. The entire mountain rumbled and sank fiercely.Countless blue flames erupted unprecedentedly, sweeping through the entire Starfish Race Island.The flames didn't cause any harm to Xu Qing and the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples.However, other than them, all the nonhumans on the island were burned. In an instant, mournful cries rang out from everywhere.Countless worms let out shrill cries but it was useless. They could only turn into ashes in the flames."Refine this person and all the lives on this island, blood ensemble!"Lord Sixth's voice spread. He performed a series of hand seals and pointed. Immediately, the mountain shook and lumps of qi and blood rose from Starfish Island. Dense qi and blood erupted from Bai Li as well.Bai Li's miserable cries continued to ring out. All the nonhumans on the island were wailing. The iron thread worms in their bodies crazily burrowed into the depths of their flesh but it was useless. The flesh of all the nonhumans were melting!The rivers and lakes on the island also rapidly evaporated."Refine this person and all the lives on this island, bone ensemble!"Lord Sixth raised his hand and roared. All his cultivation base erupted and surged into the mountain. Immediately, the bones of all the nonhumans on the island melted. The worms that had escaped into the marrows were also instantly burned.The ground rumbled and mountain peaks collapsed one after another and more cracks appeared on the ground. The edges were completely peeled off piece by piece and they rose all the way to the Sixth Peak, fusing into the mountain's body, causing the Sixth Peak to become even more majestic."Refine this person and all the lives on this island, soul ensemble!"Lord Sixth raised his right hand and the wine gourd in the sky erupted. It broke free from the lightning and entered Lord Sixth's hand. He took a sip of wine and spat it out.Immediately, the mountain trembled again and the ground continued to collapse. Strands of souls arrived from all directions. The iron thread worms hiding in the sea of consciousness wailed as they faced their deaths!The ground was rapidly shrinking and there were even more land masses rising into the air. The entire Starfish Island was in pieces and there was an endless sea of fire burning it."Refinement Samsara!" In the end, Lord Sixth bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood that landed on the mountain.The entire Starfish Island completely collapsed and surged toward the Sixth Peak to be absorbed by it.At this moment, all the lives on the island completely disappeared along with the sea of fire.The Starfish Island was gone!It was as though it had been erased!Only a huge pit was left on the surface of the sea.The seawater in the surroundings didn't dare to pour in, causing the deep pit to be extremely obvious. Only the mountain of the Sixth Peak stood tall and emitted a light that was as resplendent as the sun and moon.Bai Li's body and soul were destroyed!The Starfish Race was exterminated!<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="b2969299-d5d6-4179-a675-9a3ba2834141">There are four characters(鼻头生火) in the calligraphy, but it would not make sense to translate them character by character.

Chapter 306 Bai Li Soul Pill (1)
Time passed.Seven Blood Eyes, Port 176.Xu Qing sat cross-legged on the deck of the swaying magic ship and looked at the distant world. It was early in the morning and the red glow rose from the horizon, as though flames were burning the sky.Xu Qing watched silently.It had been half a month since the Starfish Race was exterminated.In this half a month, the storm caused by the Starfish Race's matter was still spreading. As the Seven Blood Eyes announced the evil deeds of the Starfish Race and the Illuminate's member Bai Li behind them, the other races finally knew the reason for their heaven's chosens' disappearances. Their anger toward the Starfish Race and Illuminate could not be put into words.Although the Starfish Race had been exterminated, the other three races were still around. There was no need for the Seven Blood Eyes to make a move. Those races that had lost their heaven's chosen made their moves and headed to the territories of the other three races. There, they saw a large number of iron thread worms and a lot of evidence. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ Very soon, the three races that had already suffered great losses in the battle with Lord Sixth were destroyed by the other races.Lord Sixth's attack this time increased the Seven Blood Eyes' reputation even more. Many races were wary of the Sixth Peak's mountain war fortress.However, after analysis, most of them felt that although the mountain was strong, the power source inside was ordinary. Although it could support the teleportation of the mountain, it was clearly somewhat weak in terms of suppression.There were even people who deduced that if it wasn't for the human race's battle flag, it would probably be very difficult for Lord Sixth to suppress that Illuminate member.However, no matter what, it was a fact that the Starfish Race had been exterminated and the Illuminate member, Bai Li, had been refined. Hence, the strength of the Seven Blood Eyes once again penetrated the hearts of the other races.After Lord Sixth refined the entire Starfish Race, he brought Xu Qing and the captain back to the Seven Blood Eyes. When they returned, Lord Sixth was silent, and so was Xu Qing.They didn't feel the joy of killing their enemy that they had imagined. Instead, they became calm and the melancholy in the depths of their hearts turned faint.However, life had to continue."Farewell, Teacher." Xu Qing picked up a wine gourd. He lifted it in the direction of Purple Earth and took a big gulp. He then closed his eyes.The moment he closed his eyes, a rumbling sound rang out from his body. The 65 magic apertures were like a stove that was burning fiercely. On them... a large number of remnant souls were being refined.These remnant souls were all members of the Starfish Race. They did not have a lot of energy, but there were a lot of them, so they could provide some help in opening magic apertures.Among these many souls, there was also a special soul suppressed in one of Xu Qing's magic apertures. It burned day and night and never stopped.This soul was that cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race.After he was captured by the shadow, he finally collapsed after being tortured by Xu Qing for a few days. Xu Qing then successfully extracted his soul.Golden Crow Refines All Life still couldn't snatch the talent of this Bizarre Fiend Race. It wasn't that the emperor-level cultivation art wasn't good but there were too few origin power. If he wanted to snatch the talent of a race, he needed to refine a large number of members of this race.Xu Qing didn't care. There was only one thing he cared about and that was to make this cultivator suffer.However, the souls of this race had another characteristic. Their soul power could slowly recover on its own. It was the same even when they were suppressed and refined."Lord Sixth extracted the souls of the Starfish Race and refined them into a candle. I can't do this but I can suppress this soul for years and make it wish it was dead. It can continue to provide me with soul power. One day, I'll be able to snatch its talent," Xu Qing said softly.Regardless of whether it was because of the uniqueness of this soul that continued to provide soul power or his hatred for this bizarre fiend cultivator, Xu Qing wouldn't devour it so easily.At that moment, his body rumbled. Other than the suppressed soul, the other remnant souls transformed into a force that attacked the 66th magic aperture. In an instant, the 66th magic aperture was opened. It wasn't over.At the next moment, the 67th magic aperture was opened.The remaining force continued to gather at the location of the 68th magic aperture. After colliding with it for a long time, it finally broke open.Xu Qing's entire body trembled and his aura and magic power clearly increased by a lot.He had long sensed that the difficulty of opening the magic apertures after the second life fire was much greater than before. Moreover, the souls of the Starfish Race were incomplete, so they could only provide him with the power to open three magic apertures.Xu Qing opened his eyes and took out a jade box.In this jade box was a black pill. A sinister soul shadow appeared on the pill and let out a soundless roar, as though it wanted to break out of the restraints of the pill and escape. However, it clearly couldn't do so.This was an extremely precious high-level soul pill!To cultivators who cultivated the Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, souls were the fuel to open their magic apertures. Hence, they needed to kill a lot and extract souls to continuously increase their cultivation.However, unless there was a war, it was not easy to kill many. Hence, there were soul pills. One such pill could allow a cultivator to obtain a large amount of soul power.For example, the pill that First Peak's Wu Jianwu had thrown out was also a soul pill, but its grade was extremely low.As for Xu Qing's pill, Lord Sixth had personally refined a portion of Bai Li's soul into it and given it to him after returning to the sect.He only extracted a very small portion.Lord Sixth was straightforward. He needed a large number of souls to replenish the power of the magic artifacts, so he could only give Xu Qing one pill. However, he told Xu Qing that he owed him a favor.

Chapter 307 Bai Li Soul Pill (2)
Xu Qing didn't care about this. The main reason why his revenge this time went smoothly was because of Lord Sixth. Hence, even if he wasn't given the soul pill, Xu Qing would feel that it was reasonable.The pendant given by Lord Sixth had expended a lot of energy in the battle with Bai Li, but it could still be used. Its value had already surpassed the soul pill.Xu Qing retracted his thoughts and picked up the soul pill. He threw it into his mouth without any hesitation and chewed it bit by bit. The remnant soul inside let out a mournful cry but in the end, it couldn't escape the outcome of being devoured. Under the burning of the fiendish fire in Xu Qing's body, it transformed into an impact force that rushed toward the 69th magic aperture.Xu Qing's body trembled slightly. The 69th magic aperture was opened, followed by 70th, 71st…The power of the soul pill didn't seem to diminish in the slightest. Very soon, the 72nd magic aperture was opened. Next was the 73rd, 74th, and 75th.This wasn't the end. The 76th, 77th, and 78th magic apertures were also opened soon after!The might of the soul pill refined from Bai Li's remnant soul was extremely astonishing.Finally, as Xu Qing opened his eyes in which purple light flickered, the 79th magic aperture was opened!A terrifying aura circulated around his body and astonishing magic power spread as his cultivation base increased. The seawater in the surroundings stirred up waves."It actually opened 11 magic apertures… This soul pill probably doesn't only contain Bai Li's remnant soul!" Xu Qing was a little shocked. He could vaguely guess that the remnant soul that Lord Sixth mentioned included the remnant souls of the other four races' ancestors and a large number of cultivators from the four races.Although most of the four races had been devoured, the base number was huge after all. Even if only a small portion of the remnant souls were gathered together, their might would naturally be terrifying."There are still 11 magic apertures left before I can form the third ball of life fire!" Xu Qing said softly. After that, he checked his storage bag. There were two wish boxes inside. Ever since he knew how to open them, he had been nurturing them in his free time. Now, he wasn't far from completion.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and looked toward the Nanhuang Continent behind him. Now that everything was dealt with, he missed Captain Lei a little.During this half a month, the war between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race also changed. Firstly, the third highness did a shocking thing.Xu Qing had never seen the third highness in the war. It was only when this matter spread that he knew that the third highness had accepted a mission to instigate rebellion when the war had just begun.Xu Qing didn't know how the third highness did it. He successfully instigated the three important allies of the Sea Corpse Race to defect on the native battlefield of the Sea Corpse Race, causing the situation of the Sea Corpse Race, which was originally in a stalemate with the Seven Blood Eyes, to instantly change and show signs of collapse.This caused a series of chain reactions. On one hand, the Seven Blood Eyes' momentum soared and their morale was high in the battle. On the other hand, the Wanggu Continent's forces, especially the Seven Sects Alliance seemed to be caught off guard by the sudden change in the war situation.Clearly, the Seven Sects Alliance wanted to see the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race exhaust each other. Hence, they were only observing this war at the start. It was only when the Seven Blood Eyes fought their way to the Sea Corpse Race's territory that they became vigilant.This was because… the territory of the Sea Corpse Race was very close to the Wanggu Continent.To be precise, there was a path that went from the Wanggu Continent to Sea Corpse Race's main island, sub islands, Merfolk Race Islands, and the Seven Blood Eyes. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ Before the third highness instigated the rebellion, the Seven Sects Alliance was paying close attention to the battle. They hoped that this war would continue and the Seven Blood Eyes' foundation would be exhausted. However, the third highness' success changed their attitude.The Seven Sects Alliance began to interfere in the war.Some rumors about the war appeared in the Seven Blood Eyes. Some people guessed that this war was about to end. The interference of the Seven Sects Alliance would make it very difficult for the Seven Blood Eyes to continue attacking.Xu Qing didn't pay attention to these subsequent events.He wanted to make a trip back to the scavenger campsite and the forbidden zone to sweep Captain Lei's grave. At the same time, he wanted to see if he could find any traces of Cross and Luan Tooth.Two years had passed. He wondered how the two of them were doing now.Xu Qing stared into the distance and stood up. He kept the magic ship and walked toward the teleportation array. On the way, he saw the captain bargaining with a fruit stall owner. His expression looked pained as he paid a few spirit coins to buy a bag of apples.Upon seeing Xu Qing, the captain threw an apple over and also took out an apple for himself. He looked at Xu Qing and smiled."You're going out? Bring me along, bring me along."Xu Qing took the apple. He didn't believe that he had met the captain by chance. As such, his eyes revealed doubt.The captain coughed and sighed as he ate the apple."I have no choice. The old man asked me to follow you and protect you before he returns. I reckon the old man is a little anxious. If he wants to take in a disciple, then do it. Why did he need to create these tests? Now, he is anxious, but cannot return due to the war."The captain shrugged and sold Old Master Seventh without hesitation.A strange expression appeared on Xu Qing's face. After some thought, he didn't refuse.After all, the wanted list of the Sea Corpse Race was still there. Moreover, Chen Feiyuan had told him about Purple Earth's malice. If the captain was by his side on this trip, it would be safer.However, correspondingly, the journey might head in a crazy direction too."I am making a trip home." Xu Qing looked at the captain."Going home? Then I can be considered a guest. Haha, let's go, let's go. I'm already tired of staying in the sect recently. Let's go out and relax." As the captain spoke, he was even more enthusiastic than Xu Qing and quickly walked toward the teleportation array.​ "Did you do something? Are you going out to lie low?" Xu Qing was surprised."How is that possible!" The captain immediately shook his head. After flying to the teleportation array, he asked Xu Qing for the location and immediately adjusted the teleportation array. Amidst Xu Qing's confusion, the two of them disappeared in the teleportation array.Not long after they left, a furious roar rang out from the Sixth Peak."Chen Erniu, you little bastard, you eat everything?"Following the shout, a divine sense erupted from the Sixth Peak and swept through the entire main city, searching for the captain's figure. Clearly, it was fruitless…Behind the hall on the Sixth Peak, in the mountain forest, Lord Sixth looked at the covered hole in front of him with an ugly expression. Only the Sequences, and the top two or three among them at that, could do such a thing on the Sixth Peak.This hole was very deep and meandered into the interior of the Sixth Peak's mountain. That was where the core power source of the Sixth Peak's war fortress mountain was.The core power source of the Sixth Peak was a secret. It was enveloped by fog and it was very difficult to see what it was. However, in Lord Sixth's eyes, everything was clearly visible.He saw a deep bite mark on the toe of the core power source, and it was clearly missing a small piece."Was this Chen Erniu a dog in his previous life? He takes a bite of everything!" Lord Sixth took a deep breath. He was a little angry, so he looked at the power source that was enveloped by the fog."That kid should have seen it and probably guessed it… However, he should know his limits and know what to say and what not to say. After all, I endured it and didn't use the core power even when fighting Bai Li… If he spread the word, the ancestor would skin him alive."

Chapter 308 The Secret Of The Seven Blood Eyes
"Captain, why is your body trembling?"On the teleportation array in Antler City in the eastern part of the Nanhuang Continent.As the teleportation light flickered, Xu Qing and the captain's figures appeared.Xu Qing habitually hid his appearance. The captain was even more familiar with this and disguised himself as a middle-aged man. However, when he walked out of the teleportation array, his legs were clearly trembling.Xu Qing was surprised."Trembling? How is that possible? You're mistaken." The captain coughed and patted his leg heavily.Xu Qing didn't speak. He didn't need to guess to know that the captain must have done something major in the sect. Otherwise, with the captain's madness, it was impossible for him to still be trembling after arriving here.Since the captain didn't say anything, Xu Qing didn't ask. After walking out of the teleportation array, he looked at Antler City, which was familiar but unfamiliar. The scene of him teleporting from here after burning the Diamond Sect surfaced in his mind.Xu Qing walked forward while reminiscing.Although this was a branch city of the Seven Blood Eyes, its location was remote and the environment was harsh, causing this place to be much dirtier and more chaotic than the Seven Blood Eyes' main city. There were some smelly rotting things everywhere on the ground. Many skinny figures sat in the corners of the streets and looked at the sky listlessly.The entire city was filled with an oppressive atmosphere.Xu Qing silently walked forward. He didn't encounter any ignorant people on the way. After all, although human nature was violent in this desolate place, those who could survive here weren't fools.They could instinctively distinguish who they could bully and who they couldn't provoke.Xu Qing and the captain gave them the feeling that they belonged to the latter type."Xu Qing, are you really not curious?" When they reached the city gate of Antler City, the captain couldn't help but take out an apple and take a bite. He wasn't very concerned about the surrounding environment. Instead, he was very curious that Xu Qing could really hold back from asking."Curious." Xu Qing didn't turn his head. After he walked out of Antler City, he looked at the land of forbidden zone that had turned into ruins after the god opened His eyes.Antler City wasn't far from the small city he was in back then."You don't look curious at all… Forget it, forget it. Seeing that you were once my team member and owe me 50,000 spirit stones, I can divulge a little.""Ancestor is playing a big game of chess! I can't say anymore. If I continue, the ancestor will probably skin me alive!" The captain looked around and said in a low voice. Xu Qing nodded and moved forward rapidly. He wasn't going to return to the ruined city. There was nothing for him to miss there now. Moreover, the reason why he was chased by the Diamond Sect's ancestor last time was because of the strangeness there.There was no point in going again.As such, Xu Qing headed toward the scavenger campsite.The captain walked beside him while looking at the surrounding wilderness. It was early spring here and the traces of snow could occasionally be seen. The wind that blew over didn't contain warmth and was freezing."Let me tell you, Xu Qing. Lord Sixth… He's also an old schemer. Back then on Starfish Island, he put on a good show." The captain saw that Xu Qing still didn't continue to ask and his heart itched. He couldn't help but want to show off what he had seen but he didn't dare to say it all.Xu Qing nodded."Aiya, Xu Qing, it's not good to be like this." The captain was a little helpless and took a bite of the apple."You would never guess what I saw in the Sixth Peak. I was too shocked and surprised. This is a huge game of chess.""As expected, the older one is, the shrewder they are. Those old fellows from our Seven Blood Eyes are toying with people."The captain took a deep breath and sighed with emotion.Xu Qing frowned. When he heard this, he didn't understand much. He only knew that the major thing the captain did should be related to the Sixth Peak. He thought of the captain's gaze when he looked at the Sixth Peak's mountain before and his heart skipped a beat."Captain, don't tell me you went to the Sixth Peak to bite something?"The captain raised his brows in dissatisfaction."What do you mean by biting something? Deputy Captain, let me remind you, who talks to their superior like this!""I'm the director of the Homicide Department," Xu Qing calmly said."I'm your senior brother!" The captain finished the apple and took out a pear, looking like he had known that Xu Qing would say that."I haven't acknowledged a master yet," Xu Qing replied."Hurry up and greet your eldest highness!" The captain lifted his chin and looked disdainfully at Xu Qing.Xu Qing fell silent. He discovered that he couldn't win against the captain this time around, so he pretended not to hear and continued forward. With his current speed, it would only take an hour to travel from Antler City to the scavenger campsite.He leaped over a mountain peak and saw the scavenger campsite at the foot of the mountain as well as the pitch-black forest in the distance.From here he could see black fog enveloping the forbidden zone's forest. Bolts of lightning filled the air and occasionally landed in the forbidden zone, emitting rumbling sounds.The captain glanced at the forbidden zone in the distance and revealed a hint of surprise."This forbidden zone is very large, and there are divinity fluctuations inside!"Xu Qing nodded. In the past, his cultivation was too weak and he didn't know about divinity. Now that he had returned and was standing here, he could clearly sense the divinity fluctuations in the forbidden zone in the distance.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and stared at the scavenger campsite below. That place was still chaotic and he could faintly hear unscrupulous laughter from inside.He walked forward. The captain coughed at the side."Little Qing, Senior Brother was humoring you earlier but you don't have to be discouraged. This matter is too big, so I can't tell you.""This matter involves the battlefield. You don't know but when I entered the Sixth Peak and saw it, I was stunned.""In addition, I think the future development of the Seven Blood Eyes should be very good under the lead of such a group of old schemers…""Are you really not curious? How about this, say a few good words and I'll risk being skinned alive to tell you."On the way down the mountain, the captain was clearly the one with the secrets and kept wanting to make Xu Qing curious. However, in the end, his intention to show off made him even more anxious than Xu Qing.Xu Qing remained silent as he walked into the scavenger campsite.What greeted his eyes was similar to what he remembered. The ground was covered in filth and the surroundings were in ruins. The scavengers wore leather coats. Some were covered in filth and some had scars on their faces.The arrival of Xu Qing and the captain caused the noisy scavenger campsite to slowly fall silent. Most of the scavengers retreated a little and revealed fawning expressions.However, Xu Qing knew that behind these fawning expressions, they were observing if they could rob them.Xu Qing swept his gaze over them, but didn't see any familiar figures. Two years was no different from a lifetime to most scavengers.He walked around until he arrived at the house he used to stay in.This house had already been occupied by someone else.After a long while, Xu Qing sighed softly and turned to leave. The captain also glanced at this house and understood that this should be Xu Qing's residence back then. At this moment, when he was walking beside Xu Qing and was about to leave with him, the captain suddenly saw a tent.There was a feather hanging on the tent.Unlike Xu Qing's childhood, the captain clearly didn't know what this feathered tent meant in the scavenger campsite and the slums. However, very soon, he saw someone walking out while tying his trouser."I see. It's similar to the brothel, but the scavenger campsite uses feathers as the signboard." The captain came to a realization and was about to retract his gaze. However, at the next instant, he stared at the feather again and then looked at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, back then on the merfolk island, after you saw that half of my body was gone, you said that you wanted to give me a feather…" The captain's eyes widened.Xu Qing glanced at him and took out an apple. He took a bite and continued walking.The captain snorted and glanced at the feather again. He then turned and ran over. It was unknown how he communicated with them but when he caught up to Xu Qing, there were already seven to eight feathers in his hand."This is a good thing. I'll give one to Zhang San when we get back."Xu Qing walked out of the scavenger campsite. As he walked toward the forbidden zone, he glanced at the feathers in the captain's hand. When he was about to reach the forbidden zone, he suddenly asked."Captain, what did you see on the Sixth Peak?"A smile appeared on the captain's face. He had been waiting for Xu Qing to say this. Moreover, he had been holding it in for the entire journey, so he didn't hide it. After he kept the feathers, he looked around and spoke in a low voice."Before I tell you this answer, recall the sect's war route this time.""First, the Seventh Peak held the competition on the merfolk island. This lured the Sea Corpse Race. The ancestor suddenly appeared after making a breakthrough… After that, the merfolk island was set up as the frontline command center.""We then declared war on the Sea Corpse Race and spread forward step by step. We captured the sub islands and are now attacking the Sea Corpse Race's main island." Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ "Just like that, a line was formed on the Forbidden Sea, causing the Seven Blood Eyes, which was originally very far from the Wanggu Continent, to become very close to the Wanggu Continent…"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed."Then what exactly is the sect's goal? Is fighting the Sea Corpse Race all of it? Is it possible that fighting the Sea Corpse Race… is just a segment to complete the deeper strategic goal?"The captain spoke softly."In the Sixth Peak, I saw a statue of an Ancestral Corpse that doesn't belong to one of the nine ancestral corpse statues of the Sea Corpse Race… It is the power source of the Sixth Peak's war fortress."
