The reward this time was shocking.It could be seen that the Seven Blood Eyes' upper echelons hated Night Dove to the core.Xu Qing wasn't the only one who was tempted. At this moment, the eyes of everyone in Team Six lit up. Some of them chuckled, while others licked their lips. There were even quite a few who revealed looks of desire in their eyes.To the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes, the acquisition of cultivation resources determined everything for them.Normally, everyone would have to use all sorts of methods to capture wanted criminals to earn extra money. There weren't many opportunities for such large-scale operations. But now, everyone realized that once they completed this mission, they wouldn't be lacking in resources in the near future.Hence, everyone's breathing slowly quickened as they looked at their captain."Captain, when are we setting off?"p "That's right, let's go!"Hearing the team members' anxious voice, the captain smiled and took a bite of the apple in his hand. He then took out a jade slip and distributed it to everyone."Our target isn't big. The two enemy leaders at the perfected Qi Condensation Realm must be ours!""When we reach our destination later, we'll infiltrate and behead them. When we act, I'll deal with one of them first. As for the other one, once you see him, besiege him immediately. If you can kill him, kill him. If you can't, drag it out until I arrive. I hope that when this mission ends, all of you will still be alive.""Now, let's go!"The entire Homicide Department was instantly mobilized.From afar, one could see numerous figures rushing out of the Homicide Department's government office under the moonlight, heading toward various directions in the city.The speed was so fast and the killing intent was so intense that every single figure was like a thorny tentacle of the Homicide Department. As they continued to spread out, the entire Homicide Department was like an ancient giant beast that had awakened and was stretching its entire body. Its domineering pressure instantly erupted.This caused all the evil characters in the city to be horrified."Each person can obtain ten spirit stones if we kill the enemy leader. There are two enemy leaders… If they are killed by Team Six, each of us will gain at least 20 spirit coins."Xu Qing was moving with the members of Team Six. As he sped forward, he muttered inwardly as anticipation appeared in his eyes.He quickly scanned through the jade slip distributed by the captain. It contained information about everyone in the stronghold. It was extremely comprehensive. The enemies' appearances and their specialty techniques were all recorded. It could be seen that the department had investigated Night Dove thoroughly during this period of time.As everyone neared their targets, they stopped talking as they followed their team captains. The speed was getting faster and faster and their killing intent boiled and intensified.In the darkness of the night, killing intent towered into the sky. The mobilization of the Homicide Department was completely out of the blue, causing everyone who saw them to feel their hearts pounding. Their eyes were filled with terror as they instantly hid.Those noisy betting booths and gambling dens also swiftly quieted down. The people inside were dumbfounded and immediately closed the main gate in fear. All the evil characters were clearly aware that since the Homicide Department had made such a move, it meant that tonight… Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The entire main city was going to bleed!Countless people would die tonight. It was as though lightning had streaked across the sky, wanting to dispel all the evil!In fact, many of the inns that did business at night also chose to close today. It was the same for Panquan Road…At this moment, Team Six passed by Panquan Road. Xu Qing watched as the old man from the inn quickly closed the gate. Their gazes met for a moment."He's afraid…" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and noticed the hint of wariness in the old man's eyes. He lowered his head and looked at the badge on his clothes.At least, tonight, the badge on his gray Daoist robe represented the dignity of the Seven Blood Eyes.No matter what faction it was, be it small gangs or big forces, they would have to lower their heads tonight and hide!If they even made the slightest bit of interference, they would be instantly crushed."There is light and darkness everywhere, and it's the same here. Although the sect is allowing darkness to flourish in the main city, there are rules. One, they can't lay their hands on commoners. Two, outsiders who have reached Foundation Building can't kill our sect's Qi Condensation cultivators. These are two red lines. If they cross this boundary… they have to pay the price."The captain at the front calmly spoke. He then assigned tasks before continuing onwards.Xu Qing's heart stirred. Although he had realized this earlier, he was now involved in it. After experiencing it personally, he had a deeper understanding of the domineeringness of the Seven Blood Eyes.He was following his team members. Their target was clear. An hour later, they saw their destination from afar.It was a manor.The bright moon hung high in the sky, and the land was pitch-black. Although there were lights in the manor, in the darkness of the night, these lights flickered and seemed about to extinguish.Outside the manor, with the arrival of Team Six, a few disciples from the Homicide Department who were hiding in the dark immediately walked out.They were arranged by the department to be in charge of keeping an eye out. After cupping their fists to the captain, they quickly left."Follow the plan, the infiltration begins!" A cold glint flashed in the captain's eyes as his body flashed into the manor. As for the members of Team Six, eight of them surrounded the manor and formed a blockade. The remaining dozen or so people then spread out and sneaked into the manor from various locations.Xu Qing was among them. Right now, he moved extremely fast with his back arched.From afar, the members of Team Six looked like a gigantic hand that grabbed at the light.At the same time, the figures of a Homicide Department team appeared in the distance. The person leading in front was none other than the youth from the Merfolk race. They were Earth Team Three, and they would be fighting together with Team Six tonight.

Chapter 112 Snatching My Credit? (2)
When the merfolk youth saw that Team Six had already rushed into the manor, disdain appeared in his eyes. He sneered and waved his hand, and a black circular object immediately flew out. It landed in the manor and exploded, emitting a loud bang.The members of his team all laughed sinisterly and threw out similar items. Immediately, loud sounds rang out throughout the manor.This sudden sound instantly woke up Night Dove's members in the manor. Their expressions changed and they quickly spread out, causing Team Six's plan to sneak in and assassinate to fail.Xu Qing frowned. Team Three's actions were very obvious. They wanted to use this method to interfere with Team Six's mission.One of the self-detonating items landed not far away from him. At this moment, amidst the intense sounds of explosions, the Night Dove cultivators in the manor scattered in all directions. Some of them even set up fires and activated their traps, causing the entire manor to be instantly engulfed in flames. A large amount of smoke also spread in all directions.The smoke and fire affected the vision, and the sounds of fighting, shouts, and explosions instantly rang out.A good assassination plan was now destroyed, and even caused casualties.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes, but he didn't bother with Team Three. As dense smoke spread out, his body swayed and killing intent appeared. He fiercely waved his dagger toward the side. A blood-curdling scream rang out as a Night Dove cultivator's neck was slit.​ This person was a middle-aged man with a cultivation base at the sixth level of Qi Condensation. His head was decapitated and fresh blood spurted out of his neck. His eyes looked horrified.After taking the leather pouch from the man's body and tossing his corpse to the side, Xu Qing sped through the smoke. The dagger in his hand shone with a black light as he approached another Night Dove cultivator and sliced his throat open.Throughout the entire process, Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He allowed the cultivator who was clutching his neck to gasp for air and convulse on the ground. He kept the other party's leather pouch and quickly left to search for another target. Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ The shouts and miserable cries continued to grow intense as time flew by. After the time it took for an incense stick to burn out, Xu Qing, who was advancing, abruptly dodged. A wind blade whistled past him.The wind lifted Xu Qing's hair, revealing a wolf-like gaze. His speed instantly erupted as he headed straight for the source of the wind blade. There were two disciples from the Homicide Department there. One was from Team Six, and the other was from Team Three. They were currently fighting against one person.The Team Three's expression changed when he saw Xu Qing, while the Team Six disciple revealed pleasant surprise. This joyous expression was rarely seen and was very sincere. This was because tonight, they were acting as a team."Xu Qing, he is an eighth level Qi Condensation cultivator!"There were two corpses on the ground that were badly mutilated. As for the Night Dove cultivator who was fighting against the two, he quickly turned to leave when he saw Xu Qing.However, it was too late. Xu Qing abruptly charged forward, and his speed was so fast that it created a sonic boom. Amidst the astonishment of the disciples from Team Three and Six, he had already arrived in front of this Night Dove cultivator and slashed the cultivator's neck with his dagger.Fresh blood spurted out. When he landed on the ground, the Night Dove cultivator had already been decapitated and was as dead as a dodo.The face of the Team Three disciple turned pale, and his eyes revealed intense fear. He had seen the strong ones from the same realm before, but it was rare to see someone who could kill an eighth level Qi Condensation cultivator with a single slash.He didn't dare to stay any longer and quickly retreated. As for the Team Six disciple, he also drew in a deep breath. The gaze he used to look at Xu Qing was also filled with shock. After bowing deeply, he vanished into the fog.Xu Qing lowered his head and glanced at the three corpses on the ground. He then calmly and slowly took out the leather pouches one by one. Throughout the entire process, his expression didn't change at all. He even rummaged through the leather pouches and put their contents into his own leather pouch.When he finished looting the last badly mutilated corpse, Xu Qing rubbed his hands and turned to leave. However, the dagger in his hand stabbed toward the center of the corpse's brows at lightning speed.His movements were so sudden and fast that there were no signs at all.At the next instant, the corpse moved as though it was sliding away, dodging Xu Qing's dagger.The corpse floated up and its eyes suddenly opened, revealing a cold glint as it stared fixedly at Xu Qing."How did you find out?""I've seen many corpses that died tragically. Your disguise isn't good." Xu Qing looked at the 'corpse' and calmly spoke. "Is that so? You can consider yourself unlucky then." The corpse wiped his face, revealing the appearance of a middle-aged man. He then exploded forth, heading straight for Xu Qing. His cultivation at the perfected Qi Condensation Realm spread.This person was one of the enemy leaders of this stronghold. He had a cautious personality and had planned to pretend to be a corpse and leave quietly. He didn't expect to be discovered here.However, he was a ruthless and decisive person. He knew that he couldn't delay, so he decided to go all out.The spirit energy in his body fluctuated, and numerous fire snakes manifested outside his body, hissing ferociously at Xu Qing.There were a total of nine fire snakes.Each of them could instantly tear apart a body at the ninth level of Qi Condensation. Now that there were nine of them, their might was so great that it was the peak Xu Qing had seen in the Qi Condensation realm.However, Xu Qing's expression didn't change much. With a wave of his hand, countless water droplets appeared outside his body. As the aura of the Forbidden Sea spread out, the water droplets distorted and gathered together in the blink of an eye, forming the shape of a crocodile.The crocodile's body was covered in scales, and it looked extremely sinister. When it opened its large mouth, its sharp teeth gleamed with a cold light. It also seemed to have some intelligence. After it appeared, it let out a roar and charged toward the nine fire snakes.They instantly collided with each other. Xu Qing's Sea Transformation Art's divine ability was completely displayed. It directly devoured five of the fire snakes. Although the remaining ones were putting up a fight, it was obvious that the Sea Transformation Art could resist them.What shocked the perfected Qi Condensation cultivator even more was that Xu Qing was moving toward him. The blood and qi shadow behind him transformed into a malicious ghost. As it growled, it followed Xu Qing's body and shot out like an arrow, heading straight for him."You're not an ordinary disciple of the Seven Blood Eyes!!" The eyes of this Night Dove's enemy leader abruptly narrowed. He sensed an intense sense of danger from Xu Qing. He retreated, and with a wave of his hand, he tossed out a talisman that flickered with blue light.He didn't even look at the result as he retreated even faster.This blue-colored talisman seemed to have been used too many times. Its color was rather dull, and its might had decreased by quite a bit. Although it instantly erupted and transformed into a blue-colored ghost hand with some Foundation Building aura, its might was still far inferior to a true Foundation Building cultivator.Although Xu Qing sensed that this talisman treasure was ordinary, he still dodged it. However, the large hand continued to chase after him, making it impossible for him to continue pursuing the enemy leader. However, Xu Qing wasn't in a hurry. While dodging the large hand, he coldly stared at the fleeing enemy leader."The poison has not broken out yet?"The instant Xu Qing's words rang out, the expression of Night Dove cultivator drastically changed. His state of mind fluctuated, speeding up the relapse of the poison. He then spat out a mouthful of black blood, and a greenish-black color appeared on his face."Poison!"All of a sudden, his body staggered as he felt the violence of the poison in his body. His internal organs felt like they were about to melt, and his eyes revealed madness. It was unknown what secret art he used, but he slammed his chest with his hands, and at the next moment, his body burned with flames. It was as though all his potential had been stimulated at this moment. The poison in his body was actually suppressed, and the greenish-black color on his face also rapidly dissipated.However, the price was clearly huge. At this moment, his consciousness was a little fuzzy. It was as though there was only one thought in his mind, and that was to escape.He tried to flee with an even faster speed.Amidst this delay, Xu Qing once again dodged the attack from the large hand and sped forward at full speed, rushing out like a bolt of lightning. His speed was so fast that he instantly got close to the Night Dove cultivator. He then reached out to grab him.However, at this moment, Xu Qing's expression changed as he sensed a life-and-death crisis. His pupils contracted as he forcefully shifted his body to move back. Almost at the instant he retreated, a sharp-edged flying wheel whistled past the area he was at.It tore through the air, emitting an ear-piercing sound. If he had dodged a little slower, his body would have been torn apart.As he retreated, a person rushed over from the direction the flying wheel came from. He didn't bother with Xu Qing but headed straight for the enemy leader. The person who came… was the captain of Team Three, the cold-looking youth from the merfolk race."Snatching my credit?" Xu Qing's gaze instantly turned sharp.

Chapter 113 Past The Red Line! (1)
He could obtain 80 spirit stones from killing the enemy leader. One could even imagine that he would gain a lot of contribution points.If Xu Qing hadn't met this enemy leader and didn't fight with him, it would have been fine.However, he had already seriously injured the other party. Just when he was about to go for the finishing blow, the merfolk youth attacked him to snatch the credit. This matter caused killing intent to fill Xu Qing's eyes.However, it was too late to give chase now. Moreover, the large blue hand formed by the talisman was also whistling over from behind him.Seeing that the merfolk youth was about to succeed, Xu Qing instantly performed a series of hand seals. Immediately, a large number of water droplets appeared beside the merfolk youth, forming a gigantic jellyfish that whistled through the air."Petty tricks!"The merfolk youth sneered. He didn't stop in the slightest, and a light flashed outside his body, forming a layer of defense. The jellyfish got close and bombarded it, but the defense was so strong that the jellyfish collapsed upon itself.However, he had clearly underestimated Xu Qing's jellyfish.As it collapsed, the jellyfish's body transformed into countless water droplets, but they didn't dissipate. Instead, they rapidly gathered and formed a large net, enveloping the merfolk youth and pinning him in place.The merfolk youth frowned. He couldn't help but slow down for a moment which caused him to miss the chance to grab the enemy leader, allowing the latter to escape more than thirty feet away.Xu Qing took advantage of this opportunity and charged out fiercely. He didn't dodge the large hand that whistled over from behind at all, allowing the large hand transformed from the talisman to attack him.There was a loud boom.Xu Qing's blood gushed out, but with the help of the impact from this large hand, his speed was further boosted, and he charged out even faster. In the blink of an eye, he surpassed the merfolk youth, turning into an afterimage as he charged toward the enemy leader.The instant he got close, he quickly lifted his right hand, and the black iron stick gleamed coldly.However, at this moment, the merfolk youth broke free of his bindings. His eyes gleamed with a cold light, and the corners of his lips curled into a cold smile. With a wave of his hand, the sharp-edged flying wheel that had flown toward Xu Qing earlier moved toward the enemy leader with shocking speed.It was about to reach…At the critical moment, the black iron stick turned into a black light and moved even faster. Like a bolt of black lightning, it pierced through the back of the enemy leader's head before the flying wheel could reach it, revealing its tip that had broken out of the enemy's forehead!As a shrill cry rang out, the flying wheel whistled through the air and sliced open the enemy leader's neck, causing the head to fly into the air. Fresh blood gushed out!Xu Qing didn't bother with the flying wheel and didn't slow down at all. He leaped over and grabbed the enemy leader's head before stopping. He then coldly looked at the young merfolk whose expression was incomparably ugly."Who do you think you are? How dare you steal my credit?" Before Xu Qing could speak, the merfolk youth gritted his teeth and spoke.The killing intent in his eyes was extremely intense. He lifted his hand and caught the sharp-edged flying wheel that had flown back. His entire body was filled with killing intent, and his green eyes revealed a sinister look as he walked toward Xu Qing step by step. Xu Qing, who was holding the head of the enemy leader, similarly had killing intent in his eyes. He didn't speak, but he was already prepared to attack. He even secretly crushed a poison pill and scattered it with the wind. At the same time, the shadow under his feet quietly and quickly spread to the front of the other party. This merfolk only needed to take another step forward and he would step on the shadow.Once he stepped in, the shadow would immediately erupt forth, and Xu Qing would attack as well.He was confident that he could kill the other party in an extremely short period of time.However, just as this merfolk youth lifted his right foot and was about to land, just as the killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes was about to erupt, a cold laugh rang out from the fog."Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you try to steal my Team Six's credit?"As his voice echoed, the figure of the captain of Team Six, who was eating an apple, walked out of the fog. He ate while walking, and behind him were some of the members of Team Six. There were four people missing, and the remaining people were all holding human heads in their hands. Their aura was very aggressive.This was especially so for the captain. The stench of blood on his body was extremely strong, and the cold glint in his eyes seemed to be able to materialize, causing the surrounding air to freeze.The merfolk youth's body paused, but his footsteps didn't stop. Instead, he returned to his original position and turned to look at the members of Team Six. After a few breaths of silence, the members of Team Three also rushed over one after another.The atmosphere on both sides was very tense. This merfolk youth sneered and turned his head to coldly glance at Xu Qing. His killing intent was still there."You managed to stay alive for now, but I'll remember this." With that, he flicked his sleeve and left with his men.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Xu Qing's gaze was reserved as he stood there with a calm expression. He didn't speak."Not bad." After the merfolk youth left, the captain of Team Six smiled and walked to Xu Qing's side. He circled around him and looked at the human head in his hand and spoke with a smile.He passed an apple to Xu Qing."Here, my treat."Xu Qing took it with his left hand and took a bite. The taste was sweet, but there was an additional taste of blood. After Xu Qing swallowed it, he lifted his head and glanced in the direction the merfolk youth had left in.At this moment, the members of Team Six were all excited."The captain killed an enemy leader, and Xu Qing killed one as well. We're going to be rich this time!""With 20 spirit coins as the minimum amount, haha, this is worth it!""Xu Qing, we've already collected the heads of those you killed. The Night Dove cultivators you killed are very easy to identify. The ones whose necks were slit are yours."The teammates, who were usually cold to each other, were sincerely happy today. The feeling of being a team made the captain very satisfied. He waved his hand as if he had forgotten about the few people who had died.

Chapter 114 Past The Red Line! (2)
"Withdraw!"As the group chatted and laughed, they brought their spoils of war and left the manor. In the darkness of the night, they headed toward the Homicide Department. On the way, the gazes that the team members looked at Xu Qing with contained some respect.Not just anyone could have the same strength as the captain to kill the enemy's leader. Also, not just anyone would dare to fight for credit with the captain of another team.Therefore, no matter whose contribution it was, it wasn't important. Being able to capture the head already showed how powerful Xu Qing was.Xu Qing was used to walking at the back, and the captain also walked beside him. The captain passed him a blue-colored talisman. It was the ghost hand talisman that the dead Night Dove cultivator had thrown out earlier, transforming into a large hand that attacked Xu Qing.Following the Night Dove cultivator's death, this ghost-hand talisman became a battle trophy. However, it was torn in many areas, so it could only be used once or twice."Take it. You deserve it."Xu Qing was a little surprised. He silently took it and looked at the captain. At this moment, the captain's expression looked deep."Did I come too early just now?"Xu Qing didn't speak."There are too many people there, not people from from the Homicide Department, but hidden protectors of the nonhuman races. It's not impossible to kill them, but they are still allies after all. The merfolk race is fickle natured. I heard that their plan to rebel was discovered by the old fellows on the mountain many years ago. Hence, they used the opportunity of the competition to suppress them. However, we are still allies after all, so it's not good to act directly.""I wonder what that fish is up to. Occasionally, it likes to leave all the protectors behind and head out alone…" The captain's smile was very sunny.Xu Qing fell into deep thought. He then kept the ghost-hand talisman and took out two pears from his leather pouch. He passed one to the captain and ate the other before asking."Captain, is the body structure of the nonhuman races different from our human race?"The captain was a little surprised that Xu Qing would actually give him a fruit. He accepted it with a smile and tossed it in his hand."There are some differences. For example, poison. Many poisons that our human race can't withstand have no effect on the nonhuman races. It's the same for the opposite. Some tonics to the human race are fatal to them."Xu Qing glanced at the captain, and the latter also glanced at him. They didn't speak anymore.As he moved forward, a hint of coldness brewed in Xu Qing's calm eyes. There was a red line in his personality. Once it was touched, he would definitely think of a way to nip the danger in the bud. If the conditions and strength didn't allow it, he would firmly remember it. It was like a fishbone was stuck in his throat, and he would feel uneasy if he didn't eliminate the danger.This red line was his life safety.This was the case in the slums, the scavenger camp, and it was the same in the Seven Blood Eyes as well.To Xu Qing, the only difference was that he had to be more cautious when searching for an opportunity here and be more decisive when he went for the kill.That merfolk youth had crossed his red line, and it was even more serious than the old man from Panquan Road. It was already on the same level as the Diamond Sect's ancestor.Therefore, he wanted to kill the other party as soon as possible.Xu Qing followed the members of Team Six in silence and handed his mission alongside the others. After the team dispersed, he didn't return to the magic boat immediately. Instead, he hid near the Homicide Department and waited silently.Two hours later, he saw the merfolk youth.However, the other party wasn't alone. Under Xu Qing's careful observation, he could see wisps of concealed auras in the surroundings. The largest strand gave Xu Qing the feeling of someone at the Foundation Building Realm. This made him even more cautious.He also noticed that the merfolk youth indeed didn't show any signs of being poisoned.Xu Qing was certain that he had released the poison. This meant that the captain's words were correct. In addition, the other party had experts protecting him. Hence, Xu Qing didn't rashly follow. Instead, he judged the approximate location and left.The operation of the Seventh Peak to capture Night Dove was a complete success. All 17 strongholds in the port areas were captured in one fell swoop. Even the other forces that had connections with Night Dove were also captured and uprooted by the members of the Homicide Department. A few deputy directors also personally took action and killed many of Night Dove's experts. It was the same for the other regions. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  In this operation, nearly 2,000 Night Dove members had died, and the number of deaths of those related to them was even higher. All of their heads were hung on the city walls the next day, and the stench of blood permeated the air.However, the casualties suffered by the Homicide Department weren't small either. Over 300 disciples had died, including the man and woman whom Xu Qing had met at the entrance when he first reported to the Seventh Peak's Homicide Department. Overall, their battle results were glorious, and the various evil forces in the main city were also purged. In the following days, most of the people were in awe of this, and the plundering among the disciples also subsided by quite a bit.Also, the rewards for this mission were distributed very quickly. Xu Qing obtained a total of 130 spirit coins and was unprecedentedly wealthy. This made him even more vigilant against the greedy people in the surroundings, and killing intent rose in his heart.He would kill whoever came to snatch it.With such a large sum of spirit stones in hand, Xu Qing felt that the quality of the refining materials he had his eyes on earlier was a little inferior. He pondered whether he should buy better materials to upgrade his boat.He also paid a lot of attention to that merfolk youth during these two days. He had followed him many times, but the other party's protectors were always around, so Xu Qing didn't find an opportunity.But he wasn't in a hurry and was patient.Three days later, in the afternoon. Xu Qing took a break and was cultivating on the magic boat when someone sent him an invitation through his voice transmission jade slip.The person who sent the invitation was none other than Zhou Qingpeng, the son of a wealthy family who had entered the Seventh Peak with him."Junior Brother Xu Qing, I've finally obtained the Ghost Desire, but there are only two of them. Also, after everyone entered the sect, they distanced themselves from each other. Tonight, I've invited Li Zimei and Xu Xiaohui. How about we have a meal together? I'll bring the Ghost Desires as well."His words were sincere.Xu Qing fell silent. After knowing that the merfolk youth wasn't poisoned, he really wanted Ghost Desires to attempt refining a new poison. Hence, he checked his work shift and agreed before continuing to cultivate.Very soon, dusk fell. Xu Qing opened his eyes from his cultivation. After calculating the time, he got up and walked out of the magic boat, heading toward the restaurant that Zhou Qingpeng had decided on.The restaurant that Zhou Qingpeng chose wasn't far from the harbor. It was a luxurious-looking two-story building and was very famous in the harbor.Xu Qing had never entered this place before, but the Homicide Department had records of all the shops. Xu Qing had looked through all of them before and knew the background of this restaurant. It was opened by the port's Coast Guard Department.The Coast Guard Department was different from the Homicide Department, but it was somewhat similar to the Patrol Department. It was just that the former mainly patrolled the sea, while the latter was in charge of the city.When he neared the restaurant, Xu Qing cautiously swept his gaze across the surroundings and only stepped into the restaurant after confirming that there was no danger.As soon as he entered, the shop assistant inside noticed Xu Qing and greeted him warmly. After learning that Xu Qing was going to a reserved room, the shop assistant became even more enthusiastic and brought Xu Qing to the second floor.The room Zhou Qingpeng booked was at the end of the second floor, and the second floor of this restaurant was actually not open to commoners. Only the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples were qualified.As he got closer to the room, Xu Qing could hear the laughter of Zhou Qingpeng and the others coming from the private room."Senior Brother Zhou, this is my first time here. I heard that this restaurant is extremely difficult to book and doesn't care about ordinary disciples at all. Moreover, there are three special dishes here. It's said that they all provide a certain amount of boost to one's cultivation.""It's nothing much. This is a property of my Coast Guard Department. To the disciples of the Coast Guard Department, we can make reservations whenever we want. If you need to reserve a room in the future, let me know and I'll help you with it.""Then I'll thank Senior Brother Zhou. Senior Brother Zhou, let me toast you."As the coquettish voice echoed, Xu Qing had already arrived at the entrance. The assistant opened the door of the private room and Xu Qing saw a table filled with dishes and three people sitting there.There were two women and one man. The man was none other than Zhou Qingpeng. His face was filled with joy as he held a wine glass. Beside him was the petite and charming Xu Xiaohui.The last person was Li Zimei. She was still as reserved as before. She sat there nervously and helplessly.Xu Qing's appearance caused the two other people other than Zhou Qingpeng to be stunned for a moment."Senior Brother, you are?" Xu Xiaohui's eyes lit up as she looked at Xu Qing's face. There were waves in her eyes and she could sense the astonishing spirit energy fluctuations from Xu Qing.Seeing that Xu Qing had arrived, Zhou Qingpeng smiled and stood up. However, before he could speak, Li Zimei, who was at the side, looked at Xu Qing and spoke softly with some hesitation."Is it Senior Brother Xu Qing?"She actually recognized him at a glance.

Chapter 115 Each Has Their Own Difficulties (1)
As Li Zimei's soft voice echoed, Xu Xiaohui's eyes involuntarily widened as she looked at Xu Qing.She couldn't be blamed for not recognizing him. In her memory, Xu Qing was covered in dirt.But now, the person standing at the entrance of the private room had a slender and tall figure. His long black hair casually draped over his shoulders, revealing an indescribable elegance. This was especially so for that face that was enough to cause one to be mesmerized.He was peerlessly handsome.He had a face that looked like it had been sculpted. Under his sword-like brows was a pair of slender cold eyes that were dark and deep. The radiance that emitted inadvertently from him and the spirit energy on his body made one not dare to underestimate him."Yes." Xu Qing nodded.Xu Xiaohui's pretty face was slightly red. She picked up the wine glass and drank it to conceal the fluctuations in her heart.At the side, Zhou Qingpeng laughed and went forward to welcome him."Junior Brother Xu Qing, take a seat."Looking at them, Xu Qing politely cupped his fists and sat at the side. His gaze also swept past the three of them. Compared to the coldness and cruelty contained in the sect, these three disciples who entered the sect in the same batch as him clearly still had some warmth in them. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, it was also obvious that the environment of the sect had changed them. For example, although Zhou Qingpeng looked radiant, Xu Qing could still see the fatigue hidden in his expression.In particular, there was a hint of vicissitudes on his body. This was the growth he had gained after experiencing some things.As for Xu Xiaohui, Xu Qing couldn't describe the changes in her. He only felt that she seemed more and more like the woman in the feather tent at the scavenger campsite.Only Li Zimei didn't change much. It was just that amidst her feeling of self-consciousness and inferiority, there was more vigilance and caution in her gaze. It was as though to her, anyone who appeared in the surroundings made her wary.Time slowly passed. As everyone conversed, although Xu Qing was mostly silent, the atmosphere in the room still became lively. After all, to them, the time they had spent in the sect was still too short.However, most of the liveliness came from Zhou Qingpeng and Xu Xiaohui chatting and laughing. Like Xu Qing, Li Zimei remained silent. Occasionally, she would look at Xu Qing with an expression that clearly showed her feelings of inferiority.Very soon, Zhou Qingpeng, who had drunk a few more cups, sighed with emotion."Actually, before I entered the sect, I more or less knew some things about the sect. However, only after I entered did I understand that hearing it was different from personally experiencing it. In the Seven Blood Eyes… it's too difficult to live a good life. If we are just a little careless, we might die."  "You guys should have a similar realization… Junior Brother Xu Qing, may I know which department you went to work in? I am in the Coast Guard Department. Xiaohui is also very capable. She managed to exchange for a magic boat in such a short period of time and was arranged to work in the Dispatch Department."When Xu Xiaohui heard this, her smile was a little complicated as she nodded."I'm at the Homicide Department," Xu Qing said softly. He was not used to the atmosphere here. He felt it was a contrast to the coldness and cruelty of the people outside."The Homicide Department?" Xu Xiaohui's eyes lit up again.At the side, Li Zimei's eyes revealed a bit of envy. Compared to Xu Xiaohui, although she was no longer dressed like a dirty scavenger, she was still very ordinary. Hence, she lowered her head even more.To her, out of the four people from the same batch, three of them already had a magic boat. Only she was still ordinary. This made her feel a lot of pressure sitting here."Junior Brother Xu Qing, you actually went to the Homicide Department. A few days ago, your Homicide Department made a big move. Thousands of Night Dove members' heads were hung on the city wall. Everyone has been discussing it these few days. Oh right, regarding that operation of yours, with your strength of qi and blood turning into shadows during the entrance test, did you also participate in it?"When Zhou Qingpeng heard where Xu Qing was working, his expression changed slightly. He had seen Xu Qing before and sensed the spiritual energy fluctuations from his body. And now, he sensed that Xu Qing seemed to have grown stronger. Hence, he probed further."However, such a large-scale mission is very risky. Junior Brother Xu Qing, although your body refinement isn't bad, spells are the sharpest after all. As newcomers who have just entered the sect, the most important thing is to work hard to survive and cultivate. There will be plenty of opportunities for us to display our abilities in the future."Xu Qing glanced at Zhou Qingpeng and could tell that the other party was probing him. In reality, he felt that these three people from the same batch all had good natures and didn't have many bad intentions. This was also another reason why he was willing to come here other than his desire for Ghost Desire.He nodded and didn't speak."The Seventh Peak's Homicide Department is the same as our Coast Guard Department. There are many ferocious people there. Oh right, Junior Brother Xu Qing, I heard that there was an extraordinary character in your operation this time around.""I heard that this powerful person is in the Black Division of your Homicide Department. I don't know his name, but I heard that this person actually killed the enemy leader who was in the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm. He's the only one in this operation who isn't at the captain level and killed the enemy leader. I think this is only possible if he has raised his Sea Transformation Art to the peak proficiency. It's said that he might be promoted because of this."Zhou Qingpeng sighed with emotion and admiration. This was not a probe, but true envy.From what he knew, this matter couldn't possibly have anything to do with Xu Qing. Although Xu Qing's body refinement was very strong and his qi and blood transformed into shadows, after cultivating the Sea Transformation Art, Zhou Qingpeng had already realized how sharp the Sea Transformation Art's spells were. It would be easy to kill a body refinement expert, especially for a place like the Homicide Department where there were many experts.Even though he had sensed that Xu Qing's spirit energy fluctuations were very strong when he was at the medical shop, he still didn't associate it with the fact that Xu Qing was able to stand out among the experts in the Homicide Department and kill an enemy leader at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm.

Chapter 116 Each Has Their Own Difficulties (2)
"I also heard about this. There have been a lot of rumors about Black Team Six going around these few days." Xu Xiaohui, who was at the side, helped Xu Qing and Zhou Qingpeng to their food while saying with a smile.Over the past few days, the disciples from the various departments of the Seventh Peak were indeed discussing the operation to capture Night Dove. This was especially so for the powerful figures in this operation. Most of them had discussed it before.Xu Qing was a little surprised. For the past few days, he had been focusing on finding an opportunity to kill the merfolk youth and didn't pay attention to these things. This was the first time he heard of the rumors in the outside world and the first time he heard that he was going to be promoted."It has nothing to do with us. To us… survival is the key."Zhou Qingpeng sighed and touched his leg. There was a scar there that hadn't completely healed. He looked at Xu Qing who had been silent the entire time, and spoke earnestly."Junior Brother Xu Qing, you can't always be too solitary. You have to change your personality. You have to learn to be flexible and give some gifts to your superiors. Only then will you have a chance to obtain protection and survive better."Xu Qing simply nodded. He wasn't good with words and didn't know what to say, so he mostly just listened. Zhou Qingpeng also slowly regained the vigor he had when he hadn't entered the sect. Sometimes, he would raise his glass amidst his laughter, affecting the atmosphere.Zhou Qingpeng had clearly drunk too much and showed off his accomplishments.For example, how he had a good relationship with his current superior in the Coast Guard Department, how he made many friends and obtained many benefits. He even took the initiative to help Xu Xiaohui increase her social circle.Of course, he didn't forget to persuade Xu Qing many times to change his temper. He also told Li Zimei that he could ask if the Coast Guard still needed handymen and would recommend her if she wanted."My boss has promised me that as long as my results are slightly better this time around, he will introduce me to Senior Brother Ding Xiaohai. You guys know Senior Brother Ding, right? He is known as the number one person in our Seventh Peak in Qi Refinement." Zhou Qingpeng was very pleased with himself. Xu Xiaohui also smiled and flattered him, causing the atmosphere in the private room to become increasingly harmonious.Xu Qing also smiled and raised his cup to congratulate him.He didn't hate Zhou Qingpeng. Everyone had their own way of living. Since Xu Xiaohui was able to obtain the magic boat so quickly, she must have her own capabilities as well. As for Li Zimei, Xu Qing wasn't good at communicating, but he felt that since she could recognize him at first glance, her observation skills must be extremely sharp.This meal lasted for almost two hours.After three rounds of drinking, it was already late at night outside. Zhou Qingpeng continued to get more drunk. After everyone was done with the meal and drinks, Zhou Qingpeng passed the Ghost Desires to Xu Qing. However, before Xu Qing could pay, Zhou Qingpeng waved his hand."My family is well off. This little thing can be considered a gift between friends."Xu Qing glanced at the bag that contained the Ghost Desires and noticed the sincerity on Zhou Qingpeng's face. He was really planning to gift them to him. After some thought, he didn't force the payment and cupped his fists in thanks.The four of them walked out of the private room and arrived at the entrance of the restaurant. Zhou Qingpeng looked at Xu Qing and smiled."Junior Brother Xu Qing, I'm from the Coast Guard Department's Kun Department. I still don't know which division of the Homicide Department you're from. Let's interact more in the future. When I'm free, I'll look for you to reminisce about the past. We're from the same batch, so we must interact more. In this cold and detached sect, we can trust each other the most. We have to move forward together."Xu Qing nodded when he heard this."I'm from the Mystical Division.""Xuan department? The same department as that fierce man. He's from Team Six. Brother Xu Qing, which team are you from?" When Zhou Qingpeng heard this, he sobered up a little. Xu Xiaohui was also surprised.Xu Qing looked at Zhou Qingpeng and Xu Xiaohui, as well as Li Zimei, who was staring at him. He hesitated."I'm also from Team Six…"Zhou Qingpeng's eyes widened and he was stunned for a moment.A look of disbelief appeared on Xu Xiaohui's face as she asked in surprise."He's in the same department and team as that fierce person? I think that fierce person's surname is also Xu…"Before he finished speaking, no matter how slow Xu Xiaohui's reaction was, she still thought of something and was instantly stunned."It seems that each team only has 20-odd people…" Zhou Qingpeng said in a low voice. At this moment, he was completely sober. Only when Li Zimei looked at Xu Qing, her gaze was filled with shock and realization. In reality, when she saw Xu Qing for the first time earlier, she had keenly sensed that there was still the stench of blood on him.The surrounding atmosphere instantly fell silent. After a long while, Zhou Qingpeng laughed and cupped his fists toward Xu Qing to hide the horror in his heart.As for Xu Xiaohui, she had a dazed look on her face. She looked at Xu Qing and wanted to say something, but she didn't in the end.Very soon, everyone left in a hurry with their thoughts.However, after Zhou Qingpeng left, his body trembled. His eyes were filled with disbelief and a hint of anticipation. He immediately took out his identity token and inquired about the rumors. He wanted to know how many people with the surname Xu were in Team Six of the Profound Division…Xu Qing glanced at the departing figures of his peers and was about to turn and leave in the darkness. However, after taking a few steps, he seemed to have discovered something and turned back to look at the restaurant.There was a small and skinny figure at the entrance of the restaurant. He seemed to be discussing something with the staff, and the staff looked a little impatient."No matter what, you're still a sect disciple. Don't make things difficult for me. I've already taken all the food you guys ate earlier. If you wanted to pack them up, you should have said so earlier."This small and skinny figure was none other than Li Zimei. She had returned after leaving, and her expression was somewhat bitter as she listened to the staff's words.When Xu Qing saw this scene, he fell silent before walking over. As he got closer, Li Zimei immediately sensed it. When she turned her head and saw Xu Qing, her face instantly flushed red before turning pale in the next instant. She stood there in a daze, her pride causing her body to tremble faintly. "They probably won't accept it so quickly, right?" Xu Qing walked closer and looked at the staff as he calmly spoke.The shop assistant swept a glance at Xu Qing. He had seen many disciples in the restaurant and faintly felt that this person in front of him wasn't someone to be trifled with. Hence, his attitude became respectful."It should be confiscated." With that, he hurriedly entered and came out not long later with a packed box in his hand. He then passed it to Li Zimei.Li Zimei thanked him in a low voice and stood there in an incomparably reserved manner. The reason why she left and returned was because she didn't want others to see her. Her pride made her bite her lip so hard that it felt like it would bleed."It's fine. Food shouldn't be wasted in the first place. When I was young, I ate too much of other people's leftovers. Sometimes, we have to fight over food together before there's food," Xu Qing calmly said.Li Zimei lifted her head and looked at Xu Qing. She opened her mouth but couldn't utter a word. Under the moonlight, the wind gusted and lifted Li Zimei's hair, revealing a deep scar on her neck that was usually covered up.Looking at Li Zimei, Xu Qing didn't know why, but he thought of the little girl at the scavenger campsite. He also sensed the dense anomalous substances on her body.Although the income of the disciples who didn't exchange for the magic boats wasn't much, that was only when compared to the magic boats.Compared to commoners, it was still very good. Hence, Li Zimei's condition shouldn't be like this. Unless it was to purchase a magic boat and use all her income to exchange for contribution points, she should be extremely frugal.Hence, after Xu Qing fell silent, he took out a few white pills he had refined and placed them in Li Zimei's hands."All the best. I want to see the day you exchange for the magic boat."With that, Xu Qing turned and left.Everyone had their own way of living. There wasn't much he could help with. Everything was his own choice.Li Zimei stared at Xu Qing's back in a daze. After a long time, she lowered her head and looked at the white pill in her hand. An indescribable warmth surfaced in the depths of her heart. In this cold world, in this cruel sect, such warmth surfaced for the first time. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Hence, she fell silent for a long time. When she lifted her head again, her eyes were filled with gratitude.She was grateful for the white pills he had given her, but she was even more grateful for his words of encouragement.Her self-esteem made it so that she didn't need sympathy or any pity, but she needed encouragement."Thank you, I will definitely exchange for a magic boat!"

Chapter 117 Fair And Reasonable (1)
Time flowed by, and it was halfway through October.It should have been the season of cold dew. However, due to the location of the Seven Blood Eyes, it was still hot during the day.Only at night did it turn cold. This was the case for the sea as well. It was as though the gloominess buried at the bottom of the sea permeated the air with the moonlight, seeping out of the surface of the sea and enveloping the world. It seeped into the bodies of everyone who cultivated at night, allowing them to experience the malice of winter in advance. At this moment, the night wind gusted, and the moonlight cascaded onto the harbor, covering every inch of the bluestone road. It also landed on Xu Qing, who had ended his day's work and was walking toward his berth with vigilance.Xu Qing's figure was tall and straight as he stepped under the moonlight. His gray robe swayed as he moved, and it seemed to be dancing with his long hair. From afar, it looked like a painting of a lone figure under the moonlight.Only the cold wind at night made Xu Qing instinctively feel a little cold.What was cold wasn't his body, but the memories left behind from the slums.It was just like the marks on the painting that were caused by the smoke from the fire. Even if the entire painting was completed, even if the marks were covered with ink and framed so that outsiders couldn't see it, the painting itself knew that the marks still existed.In the cold wind, Xu Qing exhaled and quickened his pace.It had been half a month since the gathering with Zhou Qingpeng and the others.During this half a month, Xu Qing worked at the Homicide Department as usual. He didn't get the promotion that Zhou Qingpeng mentioned, nor did he care.To Xu Qing, cultivation was his current focus.His Sea Transformation Art had reached the peak of the seventh level, and he wasn't far from breaking through.It was the same for the Mountains and Seas Art. He was about to reach the eighth level.Xu Qing was looking forward to the breakthrough. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He felt that with his current battle prowess, after he broke through to the eighth level of both the Sea Transformation Art and Mountains and Seas Art, there was a high chance that he would be able to instantly kill him from when he had not joined the Seven Blood Eyes without suffering any injuries.In fact, if he encountered the Diamond Sect's ancestor again, Xu Qing felt that although he still couldn't defeat the other party even after reaching the eighth level, if he cooperated with the shadow and went all out in the preemptive strike, he would have a certain chance of resisting a few moves."Soon."Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. The enemy he was most anxious to kill now, other than the Diamond Sect's ancestor, was that merfolk youth.He felt that it wouldn't be long before he would have the strength to kill the former. As for the latter, he was already looking for an opportunity.It was just that he felt some regret. During this half a month, he would cautiously follow the merfolk youth almost every day and search for an opportunity to kill him. However, the other party always had protectors by his side, so it was hard for him to make a move.Occasionally, when the other party went out alone like the captain had said, he would use a treasure that concealed his aura and figure, causing him to disappear without a trace.Xu Qing had not found an opportunity yet, but he was still patient. After some analysis, he realized that he had to think of a way to leave some marks on the other party. "If I encounter such an opponent in the future, I have to leave a mark in advance."Xu Qing mumbled. Just like how he had learned how to deal with corpses back then, he committed this matter to memory and continued on his way.Very soon, he arrived at the berth at Port 79.On the way, Xu Qing didn't encounter any malicious gazes, and no one came to disturb him.Although it hadn't been a long time since Xu Qing had arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes, he had gradually gained some fame through killing. Such fame caused the number of people who had designs on him to be greatly reduced, and most of them were extremely cautious.At this moment, as Xu Qing released the magic boat, a gigantic boat instantly appeared out of thin air. When it landed on the surface of the sea, the sound of waves crashing against the surface of the sea could be heard.The boat was over 200 feet long and 30 feet wide, and gave off a frightening aura.Under the moonlight, the pitch-black deck emitted a black glow that seemed to have fused together with the cold light from the densely-packed scales on the outside. Coupled with the huge and sinister crocodile head at the bow, it made this magic boat seem like it had really transformed into a giant crocodile.This was especially so when the crocodile's mouth was wide open. The countless sharp teeth and the eerie glint in its eyes added to the feeling of intimidation.Upon closer inspection, one could see that the scales on the outer side of the boat were of a higher level than before. In fact, even the inner side, which was not visible to outsiders, was covered in scales.There was also a special bone that penetrated the entire ship, forming a support that was stronger than before.There was still wind circling the surroundings, causing this giant beast-like magic boat to emit waves of intimidating aura. The cabin was much larger now, and the rooms inside were the same. There were places to rest and places to cultivate. Xu Qing even built an exclusive medicine room.Other than that, one could occasionally see a wisp of green flowing light swimming around the ship like a living creature. Wherever it passed, it would strengthen the sturdiness of the magic boat.The most important thing was that there was a huge groove on the ship's deck. Although there was nothing inside, there were many densely-packed formations. Clearly, it was left there specifically.This was the level six magic boat that Xu Qing had used up over a hundred spirit stones to forge using mid quality materials!And the groove cost him another ten spirit stones.This was because he had his eyes on a material. It was a small piece of a giant whale's skull. Once it was added, it would allow his magic boat to break through from level six to the peak of level seven in terms of sturdiness.However, the pieces of the skull of this giant whale were too expensive. It was one of the inferior high quality materials for the magic boat.The price was naturally astonishing. It required a total of 200 spirit stones.This price was extremely exaggerated. Xu Qing had gone to take a look many times in the past few days, but could only leave while gritting his teeth as he decided to save some money to buy it."When I buy the giant whale's skull and make the magic boat reach level seven, and when my cultivation breaks through to eighth level, I'll head out to sea!"

Chapter 118 Fair And Reasonable (2)
Xu Qing mumbled. After making the decision, he stepped onto the magic boat and entered his cultivation room. He then sat cross-legged on a mat and closed his eyes to cultivate.The sea breeze blew for the entire night. In the early morning, it gradually dissipated like it was exhausted. As the sunlight fell, Xu Qing opened his eyes and began his day of work.After the operation to search for Night Dove was over, the work of the Homicide Department was very idle most of the time. Only occasionally would the Patrol Department apply for assistance when there was something they couldn't handle.For example, today, when Xu Qing had just arrived at the Homicide Department and reported for duty in Black Team Six's courtyard, they received an application for assistance from the Patrol Department.Not many people were dispatched. Including the captain, there were a total of six people.After they walked out of the division, Xu Qing and the other team members also found out that the target of this mission was the Dispatch Team after the captain's introduction.The Dispatch Department and the Pilotage Department were considered to be major forces in the entire port area. The former was in charge of arranging the transportation of the ships, while the latter was like the arm of the dispatcher, responsible for guiding the ships from the outside world into the harbor.Therefore, they had branches in every port. The location for the task was Port 96.Recently, there had been an intense conflict between the Pilotage Department and Dispatch Department branches in Port 96. Right now, over a hundred people from the Pilotage Department were gathered in the Dispatch Department. They seemed to be in a standoff, so the Dispatch Department reported to the Patrol Department to mediate. The Patrol Department felt that it was troublesome, so they applied for the help of the Homicide Department.After hearing the mission introduction from the captain, one of the team members spoke with a mocking expression."The main point of the contradiction seems to be the additional reward that should have been given to Port 96's Pilotage Department branch this month. Port 96's Dispatch Department only gave 10% of what it used to be. No one would agree to this.""Other than their daily pay, Pilotage disciples often helped out the Dispatch Department. As income from the dispatches was a lot more, the Dispatch Department had to give additional bonus to Pilotage on time."When Xu Qing heard this, he roughly understood what had happened."This matter was caused by Port 96's Dispatch branch. Some time ago, the person-in-charge was changed. It is that core disciple, Zhao Zhongheng."Xu Qing's eyes narrowed."As soon as this core disciple took the post, he forcefully changed the rules. It's said that the bonus given to the Pilotage Department every month went from a 50-50 ratio to a 90-10 ratio. This is the reason the Pilotage Department's disciples are enraged." As Xu Qing listened to everyone's discussion, he fell into deep thought. The group of them arrived at the Dispatch Department of Port 96. From afar, the design of the Dispatch Department looked like a sail laid out on the ground. There were many buildings of various sizes, and there were many magic boats parked at the side.At this moment, more than a hundred people had blocked the entrance of the Dispatch Department and were confronting the Dispatch Department's disciples. The sounds of quarrels rang out incessantly, and the hostility between them grew increasingly intense. There were even more disciples spectating from the surroundings.There were also disciples from the Patrol Department mediating the situation. However, both sides refused to back down, so it was extremely difficult to mediate.With just a small spark, it was very likely that the two sides would directly fight in this tense atmosphere.So, when they saw the arrival of the Homicide Department, the Patrol Department's disciples all heaved a sigh of relief. The spectators outside also made way for the Homicide Department.The captain, who was eating an apple, didn't look at the two parties who were at daggers drawn and the Patrol Department who was struggling to mediate. Instead, he found a corner not far away and sat down to watch the show.The mission of the Homicide Department was to quell the commotion after both sides started fighting. Since they hadn't started fighting yet, there was no need to bother about it.The other team members were the same. Xu Qing followed everyone and sat down as well. After his gaze swept past both parties, he didn't see Zhao Zhongheng, but he saw a familiar face.This person stood at the very front of the group from the Pilotage Department. He was a little fatty.It was Huang Yan who had generously given him the spirit condensation leaves in the medicinal shop that day."Bastards from the Dispatch Department, you're cutting off the path of survival for us Pilotage Department's disciples. Without that bonus, the speed of our cultivation and refining of our boats will slow down. How are we supposed to survive in this city that is filled with danger? You are trying to kill us by doing this. Since we'll die no matter what, we'll kill you first!"Huang Yan seemed to be the representative of Port 96's Pilotage disciples. Although he was wearing a gray robe, he held his head high and puffed out his chest. He didn't look anxious at all, and his expression even had ferocity. His voice was sharp, and his face was red as he shouted.The cultivator standing in front of him at the entrance of the Dispatch Department was a middle-aged man. This person was also wearing a gray Daoist robe. He wasn't a Dispatch member of Port 96 but Zhao Zhongheng's retainer. no(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  This matter was suggested by Zhao Zhongheng. Now that there was a problem with the other party's identity, he naturally wouldn't come out personally to resolve it. Hence, he arranged for his retainer to come and handle it. At this moment, the middle-aged cultivator's eyes revealed a cold glint, and there was even a deep sense of displeasure. He had followed Zhao Zhongheng for a very long time. Although he was a retainer, most of the piedmont disciples would greet him with respect. He had also seen many other core disciples, so he had long forgotten his identity. He didn't care much about these gray-robed disciples.This was especially so since he knew that it was impossible for his master to change the rules. So, he put on a strong front."Scram within the next 30 minutes if you don't want to die!"As soon as he spoke, killing intent filled the air among the Pilotage Department's disciples. When the people from the Dispatch Department saw this, their eyes gleamed coldly.The disciples of various departments in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, who had fought their way out of the wolf's den and didn't rely on others to gain a foothold, were no strangers to slaughter."You want us to scram? F*ck you!" Huang Yan glared and directly charged over. He was heavy but very fast. His movements caused explosive sounds.At the next moment, the disciples of both departments who had long been in a tense atmosphere started fighting at the entrance.Rumbling sounds echoed out, and spell fluctuations spread in all directions. The chaotic battle between hundreds of people directly unfolded before Xu Qing's eyes. Blood splattered everywhere along with mournful cries.The Patrol Department in charge of mediation retreated one after another. As for Xu Qing and the others, they remained seated.Xu Qing glanced at the captain at the side. The captain was eating an apple and seemed very interested in the chaotic battle ahead. He would even cheer occasionally."There are too many of them, and it'll be a little dangerous if we meddle now. We'll wait until they are mostly killed before we go and calm them down. Besides, the sect doesn't want to see two departments fighting each other. There's a high chance that they'll step out to stop it."After the captain cheered, he whispered to his team members.Casualties had already appeared on both sides of the chaotic battle. Amidst the roars and explosions that grew even more intense, Xu Qing saw that Huang Yan, who was in the crowd, was attacking crazily with bloodshot eyes. His cultivation base was at the seventh level of Qi Condensation, allowing his explosive strength to possess a very strong lethality.And at this moment, Xu Qing saw that among the people from the Dispatch Department, the middle-aged man who was confronting Huang Yan earlier was rapidly retreating. The gaze he used to look at Huang Yan was filled with malice. Taking advantage of the fact that Huang Yan was not on guard, he waved his hand, and a lancet knife instantly flew out from his sleeve.The material of this knife was special. It was somewhat transparent and extremely fast. There was a faint blue glow on it like it was smeared with poison as it flew toward Huang Yan's neck.Huang Yan was in the midst of the chaotic battle and didn't notice the knife immediately. Seeing that the knife was about to reach Huang Yan, Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and flicked his right hand lightly. A drop of water instantly formed out of thin air and flew out at an astonishing speed, landing directly on the lancet knife.The force of the water droplet was extremely great. With a bang, the throwing knife deviated in its direction and flew past Huang Yan.Huang Yan's expression changed. He first looked at Xu Qing and nodded. After that, his malevolent gaze landed on the middle-aged cultivator as he let out a low roar and charged over."Damn it!" The middle-aged cultivator immediately retreated, but it was still too late. Huang Yan caught up to him with a few leaps and ruthlessly slammed into him.The cracking sounds were drowned out by the chaotic battle in the surroundings. One could only see the distorted expression of the middle-aged cultivator as he quickly counterattacked.The chaotic battle continued with even more casualties.The captain at the side cast a glance at Xu Qing with a spurious smile.Xu Qing didn't say anything and retracted his gaze from Huang Yan. The reason why he interfered was because Huang Yan had generously given him spirit condensation leaves before.Very soon, as the battle between the two branches became increasingly intense, a low bellow rang out from afar like thunder."All of you, stop!"Amidst the sound, a figure approached from afar while stepping on the air. A powerful and terrifying aura descended from the sky, suppressing the surroundings, causing all the disciples on the ground to be mentally shaken and stop fighting."It's time to work," the captain said in a low voice. He then stood up and assumed the appearance of a law enforcer with a solemn expression. Xu Qing and the other team members also stood up.The instant they stood up, the figure in the sky rapidly closed in and stopped in mid-air, transforming into a youth wearing a dark purple Daoist robe.This youth didn't have an outstanding appearance, and his expression didn't fluctuate much. However, the aura he emitted was astonishing. He stood in the air and coldly looked at the disciples from both sides who had stopped fighting.

Chapter 119 I'll Treat You To An Egg
,m "Greetings, Deacon Li."With the appearance of the youth, the Dispatch and Pilotage disciples all stopped. All of them had looks of awe on their faces. Someone among them recognized the identity of the newcomer and immediately bowed to him.At the same time, from within the Dispatch Department, Zhao Zhongheng quickly walked out. His expression was slightly unnatural as he hurriedly bowed toward the air.When Xu Qing saw this scene, his eyes narrowed. He could sense the astonishing fluctuations from the person in the air. Compared to the Diamond Sect's ancestor in his memories, Xu Qing felt that this person seemed to be stronger.While Xu Qing was observing, Deacon Li, who was in mid-air, spoke with a cold expression."On the elder's orders, the Dispatch Department and the Pilotage Department disciples who participated in this fight will have three months' salary cut off. As for the bonus to the Pilotage Department, it will be divided as usual!""And Zhao Zhongheng, the elder has summoned you. Come with me!"Deacon Li's gaze landed on Zhao Zhongheng. Although his expression didn't change, there was some disappointment in his heart.He knew that the reason for all of this was because the grandson of the elder had committed a foolish act. He was clearly a core disciple with an extremely high status, yet he caused such a large-scale incident just by taking up a post.'Elder is such a wise person. How could he have such a foolish grandson?'Deacon Li retracted his gaze and raised his hand to grab. After hearing his words, Zhao Zhongheng, whose face was pale with terror in his eyes, was grabbed by him and taken toward the distant Seventh Peak.After he left, the matter between the Dispatch Department and the Pilotage Department was immediately resolved. However, the blood and dead bodies that covered the ground made it clear that the conflict between the two sides was only temporarily suppressed. The viciousness in each other's eyes was very obvious."Alright, the show is over. Let's go. That person just now was Elder Zhao's favorite, Li Diling, Deacon Li. Since he personally took Zhao Zhongheng away, Zhao Zhongheng is in for it."The captain took out an apple. After taking a bite, he stood up and walked away.Team Six followed. Xu Qing glanced at Huang Yan who was surrounded by the Pilotage Department's disciples and discussing something with each other. He then retracted his gaze and slowly walked away.At this moment, the sea breeze blew over, causing the long hair covering Xu Qing's forehead to flutter, revealing his slender eyes. It also revealed the charm of being able to clearly distinguish gratitude and grudges.Today's patrolling duty gradually finished with the setting sun and dusk.After Xu Qing finished his shift at dusk, he followed the merfolk youth stealthily. However, it was a pity that he still didn't find an opportunity, so he returned to his boat and started cultivating.His days at the Seven Blood Eyes were far more colorful than those at the scavenger campsite. However, Xu Qing's diligence in cultivation didn't change at all. He was very clear that this was his foundation.Moreover, his plan to head out to sea was about to reach a breakthrough soon."It's not difficult to make a breakthrough in cultivation, but I still can't afford the materials needed to upgrade my magic boat to level seven." Xu Qing mumbled. He then took out a wine flask from his leather pouch and took a sip.He didn't know when it started, but he had fallen in love with the taste of alcohol. As he drank, he wondered if he should make another trip to Panquan Road to earn money. However, after thinking about it, he felt that before he had the confidence to kill the old man, he couldn't act rashly.Xu Qing drank another mouthful of wine and found that the wine was finished.However, it was dark now, and he didn't feel like going out to buy alcohol. He simply placed the flask at the side and closed his eyes to meditate.Time flowed by, and very soon, the bright moon hung high up in the sky. The moonlight scattered onto the surface of the sea, refracting the seawater in the harbor like a mirror in the dark night. It emitted a mysterious sense of beauty.In the darkness, Xu Qing, who was sitting cross-legged and meditating, suddenly opened his eyes and looked outside the cabin.Not long later, the sound of footsteps rang out from the shore. After they gradually got closer to the magic boat, Xu Qing's eyes gleamed. At this moment, a familiar voice rang out from outside."Is Brother Xu Qing here? I'm Huang Yan from the Pilotage Department."Upon hearing this voice, the sharp light in Xu Qing's eyes dimmed. He then stood up and walked out of the cabin. Under the moonlight, he saw the little fatty standing on the shore, wearing a long gray robe that had folds on his stomach part.Upon seeing Xu Qing, a smile appeared on the little fatty's face. After the matter with the Dispatch Department was settled, he encountered something extremely joyous on his way back. He was excitedly drinking some alcohol and recalled the scene during the day when he was slightly tipsy. He made some inquiries and found out Xu Qing's name and berth before coming over to thank him."Brother Xu Qing, thank you for your help today."Xu Qing looked at the little fatty and nodded. His expression was calm as he spoke."There's no need to thank me. You gave me spirit condensation leaves in the medicine shop that day.""Huh?"Huang Yan started. After thinking about it, he seemed to recall something. He scratched his head and asked curiously."Because I gave you some spirit condensation leaves that day, you helped me today?""Not just some, but seven stalks," Xu Qing said seriously.Huang Yan blinked and carefully sized up Xu Qing. After a while, he started laughing. Originally, he came here to express his gratitude and didn't plan on having much interaction with Xu Qing. At most, he would give him enough gifts.But now, he suddenly felt that this Xu Qing was a little interesting.He took out two palm-sized eggs from his leather pouch. The shells of these two eggs were bluish-white, and they shone with a crystalline glow under the moonlight."Brother, you're a very interesting person. Let me treat you to some eggs."As he spoke, he threw one over. This egg was strange and actually passed through the magic boat's protective barrier.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. With a wave of his hand, a large number of water droplets appeared, enveloping the egg densely and holding it in the air. After taking a closer look, he discovered that the egg was intact and didn't have the slightest damage. He looked at Huang Yan."What is this?""A little toy."Huang Yan chuckled as he licked his right index finger. He then pressed it against the egg and the egg broke. His finger then circled the inside of the egg once. He placed the egg next to his mouth and took a sip, looking intoxicated.As the eggshell broke, a fragrance spread out. Even through the protective barrier, Xu Qing could faintly smell it. His cultivation base circulated on its own as though it was attracted by it. A feeling that originated from his life instinct made him realize that this egg was extraordinary. After hesitating for a moment, he thought about it and used his finger to poke the egg. He discovered that the eggshell was extremely hard. In fact, even if he exerted some force, he still couldn't break it open at all.Xu Qing was surprised inwardly and his eyes gleamed."You have to get saliva on it. This thing is very strange. If you don't get saliva on it and use too much force, it will directly explode." The little fatty burped.Xu Qing hesitated for a moment. He then put his finger in his mouth and used the finger to easily break a small hole in the egg. Immediately, an even richer fragrance spread out, causing the cultivation base in his body to suddenly circulate. In fact, even his flesh and blood seemed to emit a thirst for life at this moment.Xu Qing's breathing became slightly heavier. He took a deep sip of the egg content. His eyes narrowed as he looked at the egg before taking another deep sip.The little fatty sat at the side with anticipation. He looked at Xu Qing as though he was waiting for Xu Qing's evaluation.However, after waiting for a long time, Xu Qing still remained silent."Um, how's the egg? Does it taste good?" Huang Yan couldn't help but ask."Quite good."Xu Qing nodded. He felt a warm current flowing through his body, and his forehead was slightly covered in sweat."Of course. I spent a lot of effort to get these eggs. My senior sister really loves it. I gave it to you to have a taste."Huang Yan had a smug look on his face as he glanced at Xu Qing. In his heart, he somewhat understood Xu Qing's personality. Hence, he took a big sip and didn't speak anymore.Xu Qing also didn't say anything and continued drinking silently.Time flowed by, and the two of them were very quiet. One was on the shore while the other was on the boat. There was a faint feeling of not disturbing each other.This feeling was very novel to Huang Yan, and his body and mind couldn't help but slowly relax. At this moment, the drunkenness silently blinded his eyes, causing his vision to gradually turn hazy. Under the moonlight, he swept his gaze across Xu Qing's peerlessly handsome face and couldn't help but comment."Xu Qing, with your looks, it won't be beneficial for you when you pursue the person you like in the future. It will make the girl feel insecure. Only a person like me will make girls feel at ease."Xu Qing didn't say anything. He sat there and sucked on the eggs, not letting go of a single drop. n,o,v,e1,b,I,n[dot]n,e,t  Ignoring Xu Qing's silence, Huang Yan simply lay at the side with his hands behind his head, using the moonlight as a pillow. He looked at the bright moon in the sky and seemed to have thought of someone in his heart as he sighed."Xu Qing, do you have someone you like?"By now, Xu Qing had a faint understanding of Huang Yan's way of speaking. The other party should have a very casual and friendly personality. He shook his head."Look, I knew it. With your looks, it's very difficult for you to woo a woman. I'm different. Let me tell you, I'm very happy today. It's not because the Pilotage Department was able to get back the bonus, but because I realized that my senior sister cares about me, so I drank a little more tonight.""Do you know, Xu Qing? All these years, I've been constantly giving Senior Sister different things. Today, she finally has something she wants and even specially asked me to bring it to her as soon as possible. I'm especially touched. I realize that I like her even more now."Xu Qing hesitated for a moment. He didn't have anyone he liked, and he didn't know how people expressed when they liked someone. However, he faintly felt that there was something wrong with the fatty's words.He swept a puzzled glance at the intoxicated Huang Yan. After confirming that the other party wasn't being sarcastic, he fell silent.In his mind, he recalled what the shopkeeper said about the other party bitterly pursuing a female disciple for seven to eight years.A long time later, Xu Qing felt that he should say something. He took a sip of the egg and spoke seriously."Congratulations."Hearing this, Huang Yan became even happier and patted his stomach."Xu Qing, I can tell that your words are sincere. You're different from others!""I, Huang Yan, repay the kindness shown to me. You've helped me today, so I won't let it be in vain." Huang Yan rummaged through his body and took out a leather pouch, handing it to Xu Qing."There are a few magic boat materials here. Take them as a greeting gift.""I am leaving now, see you later."Huang Yan got up but almost fell because of dizziness. As he walked out, he took out a jade slip and began to transmit his voice non-stop…Xu Qing wanted to speak but hesitated. Looking at the other party's silly smile as he transmitted his voice, he felt that it was best not to disturb him at this moment. Hence, after watching Huang Yan leave, Xu Qing walked toward the cabin.At this moment, the sea breeze blew over, caressing his body and passing through his black hair. It carried the scent of his body and drifted toward the Seven Blood Eyes' main city under the night sky.As the wind blew past the buildings and the streets, it bore witness to the different kinds of prosperity in the night. After that, the lingering wind dissipated a little. Finally, on the Sixth Peak in the south of the city, it landed on the body of a person who was currently climbing the mountain. It lifted a few strands of long hair on his forehead, revealing an aged face.If the wind had a spirit and could bring this scene back to Xu Qing, Xu Qing could recognize at a glance that this person was none other than the Diamond Sect's ancestor.At this moment, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was silently walking on the mountain steps.The wrinkles on his face seemed to have increased.It was as though every crease contained deep sorrow. After it was piled up, it made the Diamond Sect's ancestor look extremely bitter.He walked silently until he reached halfway up the Sixth Peak and stopped beside a cave abode.The stone door of the cave abode was arched and closed. There was green grass surrounding it, and above the door, there were two words written in flamboyant calligraphy.Leisure Doorway.From the name, it could be guessed that the person who lived in this cave should be a calm and elegant person.Outside the cave, the Diamond Sect's ancestor took a deep breath and cupped his fists."Fellow Daoist Leisure Cloud, an old friend has come to visit. Can we meet?"

Chapter 120 The Weird Ancestor (1)
In the night sky, the moonlight was bright, and there were a few clouds in the sky.However, outside the cave abode on the Sixth Peak, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who was standing with his back facing the moonlight, looked a little gloomy.In this darkness, the worry on his face seemed to be even more intense.Actually, he didn't feel too bad about losing his belongings. Back then, the reason why he vomited blood was because he was angry about the destruction of the mountain gate.As for those spirit stones, they were only what he had placed on the surface.What he was truly worried about was that his enemy would become increasingly powerful in the Seven Blood Eyes.At this moment, he was extremely anxious. He looked at the cave abode in front of him. It was completely silent and there was no response.After the time it took for half an incense stick to burn out, a sigh finally came from the cave abode."You Lingzi, long time no see."The dao name of the Diamond Sect's ancestor was You Lingzi. However, in the area he was in, regardless of whether it was inside or outside the sect, everyone referred to him as Ancestor. Hence, it had been a long time since he heard his dao name from others.The expression of the Vajra Sect's ancestor revealed some recollection as he sighed softly."Long time no see."As his voice echoed, the closed stone door slowly rose with a rumbling sound, revealing the darkness within. A figure slowly walked out from the darkness.This figure's footsteps were a little strange, and every step he took seemed to be measured. After he walked out of the cave, one could see that he was an old man. He wore a dark blue Daoist robe, and under his gray hair was a stern and rigid face.He walked in front of the Diamond Sect's ancestor and stopped. At this moment, the mountain breeze blew over, blowing up a corner of his robe, revealing his legs that weren't made of flesh and blood…That pair of legs was actually forged from refining materials. They emitted a blue glow, and under the moonlight, the blue glow seemed to carry coldness."Since we haven't seen each other for a long time, what are you here for?" The old man in blue looked up at the clouds in the night sky and asked calmly.He and the Diamond Sect's ancestor were clearly standing together, but the feeling he gave off was that the Diamond Sect's ancestor was a level lower than him.The expression of the Diamond Sect's ancestor was somewhat bitter. After a moment of silence, he still spoke about Xu Qing."My sect encountered an unexpected calamity… Before that thief left, he plundered my sect's resources and maliciously set fire to the sect, burning it to ashes.""If this kid was just an ordinary person, I wouldn't have taken it to heart. However, I spent a lot of money to investigate and found out that he had become a disciple of the Seven Blood Eyes and has even gained a foothold here. This made me feel uneasy, and I kept thinking about the ancient books I've read over the years. "According to the experience I gained from reading countless ancient books, after comparing them, I discovered that most of the people like him in the ancient books possessed great fortune. Back then, I was muddle-headed. I shouldn't have acted with just myself and two sect elders. I should have used the entire sect's strength and spared no expense to kill him. Or perhaps, I should have turned hostility into friendship and given him an apology gift…""Sigh, it's a pity that I missed the opportunity. According to my analysis, if I can't suppress him before he completely matures… then I'll definitely die in the future!""I have a strong feeling that once this person rises, he will definitely bring about a storm of blood for your Seven Blood Eyes, causing your sect to face the danger of annihilation. This is what is written in the ancient books. At that time, with just a casual sentence from this person, my Diamond Sect will be eliminated."The Diamond Sect's ancestor finished speaking and lowered his head bitterly.The expression of the dark blue-robed ancestor standing in front of him slowly turned strange. He looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor and shook his head after a long while."You Lingzi, so many years have passed. You… Why are you still so immersed in fantasies? In your eyes, a small fry has become a person with great luck who can even bring about a bloody storm for the Seven Blood Eyes? He can destroy your Diamond Sect with a single sentence? You can even fantasize about such a thing…""You don't understand. I believe in my own feelings…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor also sighed.Seeing the Diamond Sect's ancestor like this, the dark blue-robed old man shook his head slightly. He didn't have a deep relationship with the other party, but they had interacted a few times many years ago. At this moment, he was somewhat unconcerned."Which peak did this kid enter?""The Seventh Peak… According to my investigation, his name is Xu Qing. He entered the Homicide Department." The Diamond Sect's ancestor knew that he couldn't hide it and spoke in a low voice. "What department isn't important? It's just that although the sect treats piedmont disciples as rearing Gu, allowing them to kill each other to survive, there are some rules in the sect that cannot be broken…"At this point, the dark blue-robed old man saw that the Diamond Sect's ancestor's expression was gloomy, so he sighed. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Forget it. The most I can do for you is beat this kid up and make him spit out the things he took from your Diamond Sect. If he doesn't have enough, I'll make him use all his belongings to offset it."He took out a jade slip and transmitted some instructions. He then pointed at the Diamond Sect's ancestor."Alright, the arrangements have been made. However, you should cultivate properly when you have the time. You're still at the early-stage Foundation Building Realm after so many years and haven't improved. Don't keep reading those nonsensical ancient books. You are too immersed in those fantasies. If you continue reading, I'm worried that you'll develop inner demons."The Diamond Sect's ancestor wanted to say something but hesitated. This wasn't the result he wanted. However, seeing that the other party had already decided, he could only sigh. In the end, he cupped his fists and bowed.…It was a night of silence.The next morning, Xu Qing opened his eyes from his cross-legged state and looked at the leather pouch beside him.This was what Huang Yan had given him last night. There were three mutated beast materials inside.
