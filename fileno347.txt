The Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled. He couldn't tell if he was trembling in fear or excitement. He knew that once Xu Qing wanted to kill someone, unless the other party had shocking methods, he would definitely fight to the death.In the past, Xu Qing's enemies weren't extremely strong but this time was different.Not only did the Diamond Sect's ancestor sense how powerful that Saintly Star was from afar, but he also occasionally heard the disciples of the Homicide Department talking about him. He knew that this person had peerless talent.However, he couldn't consider these at this moment. He understood that he only needed to know a little…With Demon Xu's personality, if he really died here, he would definitely use all his methods before he died. Detonating the iron stick was probably one of them.'Because of this Saintly Star, Demon Xu wants to kill. Because of this Saintly Star, Demon Xu wants to detonate me. Because of this Saintly Star, my life is in danger. All of this is because of Saintly Star. Saintly Star, you are trying to kill me!!'When the Diamond Sect's ancestor thought of this, his eyes turned bloodshot. He stared fixedly at Saintly Star through the black iron stick.The shadow also clearly sensed the subtle fluctuations in Xu Qing and the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Its intelligence had developed a lot now. After some thought, it also tensed up.Dusk arrived. Xu Qing had been releasing colorless and odorless poison in the surroundings.In reality, these weren't true poison. Regardless of whether it was individually or mixed together, they were harmless. However, once a catalyst was introduced, they could instantly turn into powerful poison.However, Xu Qing felt that this wasn't enough to erase the difference between him and Saintly Star. After all, Saintly Star had displayed the combat strength of six fires in the Seven Blood Eyes. This combat strength was terrifying enough to fight against the First Peak's elder.Most importantly, Xu Qing wasn't sure if the combat strength of six fires was all that Saintly Star had.In addition, he didn't sense any traces of the other party's Dao Protectors in the vicinity."With his personality, Saintly Star wouldn't make the Dao Protectors remain concealed. So, he likely arranged for them to go out and deal with other things in the Phoenix Forbidden?"Xu Qing pondered for a while. He felt that he still needed to observe more and not act rashly, just in case. At the same time, he was going to release more poison. Only then would his chances of winning increase.He also opened five bottles that contained the little black bugs and controlled them to spread out.However, after the little black bugs flew out, the results caused Xu Qing to be even more vigilant.The canopy above Saintly Star's head actually possessed some kind of protective barrier, causing the little black bugs to be unable to penetrate it immediately. They could only attach themselves to it and wait for an opportunity."My life lantern canopy can protect the soul… Does Saintly Star's life lantern protect the body?" Xu Qing fell into deep thought.Time flowed by. Dusk passed and night arrived. The bright moon appeared in the sky and scattered its light on the ground.Just as Xu Qing was sensing the poison in the surroundings and wondering which poison to add, his expression suddenly changed.He saw that the instant night fell, the expressions of the cultivators outside the temple became solemn. Some of them even had faint anticipation in their eyes.This surprised Xu Qing. He lifted his head and his gaze landed on the one-fire Foundation Building old man in the distance.Under Xu Qing's gaze, the old man's body trembled. After some hesitation, he hurriedly stood up and bowed to Xu Qing before speaking in a low voice."Fellow Daoist Xu, do you know the profundities of this Extreme Heaven Dao Temple?"When Xu Qing heard this, his expression was as calm as ever. In the information he had obtained from the sect, there was indeed nothing about the profundities the other party had mentioned. Hence, he waited for the old man to continue.When the old man saw this, he didn't hesitate or hide anything and told him the reason."Fellow Daoist Xu, this Extreme Heaven Dao Temple was normal before but there have been some changes in the past four years. Hence, there are many more people here than before.""This change is that every time night falls and the moonlight sprinkles into the Dao temple, the moment it lands on the statue, some saber shadows will appear.""Everyone can see them, but until now, no one has been able to successfully comprehend them. Only that lord…" The old man's gaze quickly swept past Saintly Star in the Dao Temple."He has gained something every night during these few days. Although we have failed time and time again, we still have some hope in our minds. We don't ask for complete comprehension. Even if we can comprehend a little, it's enough to increase our survival strength."The old man smiled bitterly.Xu Qing fell into deep thought and turned to look at the temple.At that moment, the bright moon's light covered the ground and when it landed on the temple, a few rays passed through the cracks on the top of the temple and landed in the temple, shining on the statue.Under Xu Qing's gaze, the statue in the Extreme Heaven Dao Temple slowly changed under the moonlight.Vaguely, the statue gained some liveliness and seemed to be moving. Many saber shadows appeared beside it, faintly discernible.However, in the blink of an eye, everything returned to normal.Xu Qing felt strange and continued to stare. Very soon, he sensed the liveliness of the statue again and the saber shadows around it. In the eyes of outsiders, these saber shadows were a blur. Only at a certain moment would they have the chance to see a clearer saber shadow. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' However, in Xu Qing's eyes, because he had already comprehended the Extreme Heaven Saber, each of these saber shadows was very clear.The instant he saw them clearly, an illusory heavenly saber appeared above his head!This heavenly saber was the Extreme Heaven Saber he had comprehended. As he continued to observe the saber shadows, streams of light spread from the illusory heavenly saber as though it was undergoing some changes.Upon closer inspection, one could see that this change was leaning toward the degree of materialization.In the past, the heavenly saber was in an illusory form. At this moment, starting from the hilt, the heavenly saber actually showed signs of turning corporeal in the flowing light.Moreover, this sign of materialization was still spreading. Xu Qing could imagine that once the light spread through the entire saber, the Extreme Heaven Saber would advance by a step from the illusory state in the past, infinitely close to a corporeal existence.This scene caused the dozens of people in the surroundings to tremble. As shock appeared in their eyes, a heavenly saber similar to Xu Qing's also appeared above the head of Saintly Star, who was meditating in the Dao Temple!However, his heavenly saber was green while Xu Qing's was purple!Two heavenly sabers appeared one after another. This scene caused gasps to ring out in the surroundings. Many people's eyes narrowed and their breathing became slightly hurried.The arrival of Saintly Star had already shown this astonishing scene since many days ago and the others were already used to it, but they were shocked that Xu Qing was also so peerless.This was because they knew that this scene meant that the two of them had comprehended the Extreme Heaven Saber before. Moreover, their comprehension was astonishing and they had the possibility of successfully comprehending the second saber strike."This Xu Qing… is indeed the Seven Blood Eyes' heaven's chosen!""The two of them are comprehending. And, from the looks of it, they are both materializing the saber move's illusory form. The moment the saber completely materializes will be the moment they succeed in comprehending.""It depends on who succeeds first. Once one of them succeeds, no matter how much the other person comprehends, their efforts will instantly be wasted and lose all their comprehension."These dozens of people who had watched for so many days and understood the Extreme Heaven Dao Temple very well discussed in low voices, but they didn't dare to have any crooked thoughts at this moment.This was because comprehending the Extreme Heaven Saber didn't mean that the person had lost their vigilance and killing power. If they dared to interfere, they would definitely die tragically on the spot.In the eyes of everyone outside the Dao Temple, the heavenly sabers above Xu Qing and Saintly Star's heads were emitting a resplendent light. Moreover, it seemed that the degree of materialization of Saintly Star was clearly greater. Now, it was at 50%.As for Xu Qing, he arrived late and didn't have much time to comprehend. Right now, his saber's materialization was less than 10%.Xu Qing coldly looked at Saintly Star. Looking at speed of materialization, if this continued, he would definitely be faster than Saintly Star.However, although the Extreme Heaven Saber was important, there were many Dao temples. Moreover, only by comprehending seven saber moves could it be considered an emperor-level cultivation art. Hence, to Xu Qing, success or failure in comprehending it didn't mean much..He was considering whether he should make a move while the other party was comprehending."Although he has four balls of life fire and has at least six fires battle prowess… 120 magic apertures have a huge weakness!"During this period of time, Xu Qing had been fighting against the heaven's chosens of the Seven Sects Alliance, and had studied those heaven's chosens with 120 magic apertures."I should release more poison. Only then will the poison's might be much greater when it is activated." Xu Qing fell silent and retracted his gaze as he decided to wait a little longer. Moreover, looking at the other party's comprehension speed, it was impossible for him to succeed in a few days."Also… although those Dao Protectors of his aren't here, I still have to be on guard."When Xu Qing thought of this, he temporarily suppressed the killing intent in his mind.The instant he suppressed his killing intent, Saintly Star turned his head and expressionlessly looked at Xu Qing outside the temple. When he saw the saber shadow above Xu Qing's head, his gaze gradually turned cold, as though he was looking at a dead person."Even a chicken dares to compete with a phoenix for glory!"He didn't plan to nurture it anymore. Since Xu Qing dared to fight with him for opportunities, he would just kill him and not waste so much time. After killing him, he could continue to comprehend.As for the other party's Seven Blood Eyes' Sequence identity, Saintly Star didn't care. This was because he had sensed the redness in the sky during the day. Coupled with some things he understood, he knew that… the Alliance had attacked the north.Now, it was the prime time of the Alliance. The Seven Blood Eyes wouldn't dare to make a sound even if he killed a Sequence.His personality was to follow his thoughts. Now that the killing intent in his mind had risen, he didn't hesitate at all. He suddenly stood up and took a step out of the temple.The 120 magic apertures in his body burned like a giant stove, and the four balls of life fire in his body soared into the sky. His life lantern canopy emitted a rainbow light. Behind him, the green-bodied and red-tailed Miemeng let out a cry toward the sky.The combat strength of six fires erupted at this moment. Its power was unstoppable and its aura suppressed the surroundings, causing the weather to change. It was as though countless lightning bolts were suddenly rumbling here.The people outside the Dao Temple couldn't react at all. They didn't have the qualifications to see the speed of the six fires. Only Xu Qing suddenly lifted his head.He also couldn't see the speed of six fires.After all, the difference between the six fires and the five fires was like four fires suppressing three fires. The difference was too great!However, the surroundings were filled with his poison and the little black bugs filled the barrier around Saintly Star. All of this allowed Xu Qing to instantly sense him.

Chapter 348 Life Fires
Although Xu Qing had never truly fought against six fires, he was well aware of it and could even imagine it.This was because he understood that at the Foundation Building realm, the appearance of every ball of fire would cause the cultivator's combat strength to increase drastically.Many times, he even felt that every additional ball of life fire in Foundation Building was like when he broke through to Foundation Building. It was as though he had crossed a major realm.Xu Qing didn't know if there were other worlds outside the starry sky of this world. If there were, would the various races in those worlds cultivate like them?Were they also cultivating life fires at the Foundation Building realm? And, experiencing such a huge change with every additional life fire?This was because Xu Qing felt that the difference between cultivators in the Foundation Building realm was too great.For example, four fires could suppress and kill three fires easily unless the other party had an astonishing treasure. Moreover, this difference couldn't be offset by quantity. This was completely different from when the cultivators were at Qi Condensation.It was the same logic for six fires suppressing five fires.At that moment, Xu Qing could only sense that Saintly Star had moved. However, he couldn't see the other party's figure at all.Even though the three balls of life fire in his body rose and the power of the life lantern formed, and there was the physical strength enhancement from the Golden Crow, he could only barely see the blurry afterimage of Saintly Star appearing in front of him at an incomparably astonishing speed.At the next instant, an extremely terrifying fluctuation that shattered the surroundings erupted in front of him.A rumbling sound rang out, and Xu Qing's entire body trembled violently. His body was sent flying like a kite with a broken string. His face was pale and blood flowed from his mouth, but he didn't suffer any other injuries.Outside his body, a light barrier was formed the moment Saintly Star arrived, forming a protective barrier that blocked this terrifying six-fire attack!"So you're relying on Nascent Soul protection. However, this protection is dim. How long can it last?" Saintly Star calmly spoke. He looked at Xu Qing and retracted his palm.Xu Qing's body landed on the ground and continued to be pushed back, leaving a long mark. He only stopped when he was hundreds of feet away. When he lifted his head and looked at Saintly Star, his gaze was icy cold.At this moment, Xu Qing personally experienced how strong Saintly Star was. The feeling the other party gave him was basically no different from when the Starfish Race's patriarch revealed his Golden Core cultivation.It was the same speed and explosive power.It was natural for the few highnesses of the First Peak to not be able to resist such combat strength and be defeated in one move.Clearly, if they were in the outside world and not in the Seven Blood Eyes, they wouldn't just be defeated but killed.As such, Xu Qing was very clear that even with his current combat strength of five fires, if he didn't have the protection of the jade slip Lord Sixth had given him, he would have died in that instant just now. Even the purple crystal would have no time to heal him.The terror of the six fires wasn't just these. The little black bugs that Xu Qing released could still only hide outside Saintly Star's body and couldn't break through the invisible defense formed by the power of his life lantern."In that case, the six fires… is equivalent to the power of the Golden Core with a heavenly palace?" Xu Qing recalled that when he read the information about Sima Ru from the Bizarre Hunting Sect, it had mentioned the heavenly palace.Currently, he was no longer unfamiliar with the Golden Core realm. He knew that the Golden Core cultivated the Heavenly Palace and not just one.For example, Sima Ru was in closed-door cultivation trying to form a second heavenly palace."Heavenly Palace Golden Core Realm. One palace is six fires?" Xu Qing fell into deep thought.If outsiders were to hear what Xu Qing was thinking right now, they would be astonished.This was because Xu Qing actually didn't have the slightest worry at this moment. He even had the time to consider the power of the Golden Core's heavenly palace."Interesting. You're actually in the mood to think? In that case, let's see how many times your protection can last."Saintly Star calmly took a step forward. One could only see afterimages as he directly arrived in front of Xu Qing and slapped out again.However, this time around, Xu Qing counterattacked.The instant the other party's palm landed, the 92 magic apertures in Xu Qing's body instantly rose, forming a piercing fiery light that shone outside. He then performed a series of hand seals with both hands and pressed forward.With this push, a wisp of remnant soul in his magic aperture was released by Xu Qing.Immediately, a rumbling sound echoed. Saintly Star's speed was too fast and he directly appeared beside Xu Qing. He lifted his right hand and waved it indifferently. Xu Qing's entire body trembled violently. As the jade slip's protection trembled intensely, his body was sent flying again.However, the remnant soul he had released earlier seemed to have some instinct. After it appeared, it headed straight for Saintly Star, emitting greed and madness. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' "Too weak." Saintly Star shook his head and waved his right hand to the side, wanting to erase the remnant soul.However, the instant his right hand came into contact with the remnant soul, the greed in the remnant soul increased greatly. It actually ignored Saintly Star's attack and drilled fiercely into his right hand.This remnant soul was none other than the soul of the Bizarre Fiend Race that hadn't died after Xu Qing captured and tortured it until now.This race was mysterious and innately possessed a method of possession. Even though Saintly Star had the life lantern to protect him, it protected his body, not his soul.Hence, the soul of the Bizarre Fiend Race ignored the protective barrier and entered Saintly Star's body, crazily surging toward his soul, wanting to devour it."Interesting." Saintly Star's expression didn't change at all, but the eyes of Miemeng bird behind him revealed disdain. It let out a cry before spreading its wings and pecked fiercely at Saintly Star's body!Its body was illusory and this peck directly passed through Saintly Star's body. With a mournful cry, the remnant soul of the Bizarre Fiend Race, which had been tortured by Xu Qing for a long time and was incomparably fragile, was pecked and swallowed.There seemed to be a black hole in Miemeng. After the remnant soul of the Bizarre Fiend Race was swallowed, it was suppressed in the black hole, preventing it from escaping. It kept on crying and screaming.From the start to the end, Saintly Star's expression didn't fluctuate at all. It was as though this remnant soul was insignificant to him. He turned his head and looked at Xu Qing in the distance. He shook his head."Do you have any other methods? If not, the moment your protection collapses will be the moment of your death.""You're very talkative." Xu Qing licked the blood from the corner of his mouth. His eyes were cold as he calmly spoke.Saintly Star didn't speak. He lifted his right foot and was about to land it.However, at this moment, his body suddenly trembled and his expression changed for the first time. He lowered his head and saw the last magic aperture out of the 120 magic apertures in his body; at some point in time, a shadow had appeared on it!This shadow was like a living creature. At this moment, it crazily filled the magic aperture. Its speed was so fast that almost the instant Saintly Star's expression changed and he sensed it, it had already covered the last one of the 120 magic apertures.It was completely blocked!! As this magic aperture was blocked, the fourth ball of life fire in Saintly Star's body suddenly dimmed. Even the light on his body dimmed a little.Moreover, this wasn't over. In just three breaths of time, the fourth ball of life fire in Saintly Star's body was extinguished!!A ball of life fire was supported by 30 magic apertures. This was an eternal law of the Foundation Building realm.No one was an exception. 119 magic apertures couldn't support four balls of life fire!This was the reason why Xu Qing dared to attack previously and even had the time to think about the Golden Core combat strength of the Heavenly Palace when facing Saintly Star who had the combat strength of six fires.This was the greatest weakness of these heaven's chosens from the Seven Sects Alliance after he studied them!As long as one of their magic apertures was blocked or destroyed, the other party's combat strength would instantly decrease by a ball of life fire.The thing that could achieve this was the shadow that could extinguish life fires. No matter how strong Saintly Star's cultivation was, the shadow could suppress one of his magic apertures by going all out!This was Xu Qing's method!At that moment, as the shadow crazily adhered to the magic aperture like a plaster and desperately blocked it, the life fires in Saintly Star's body went from four balls to three balls.His expression turned gloomy. However, regardless of whether it was Miemeng's attack or his life lantern's fire, they couldn't expel the shadow.He understood how it appeared.It had hidden in the remnant soul from before and entered his body. The remnant soul was only a cover to attract his attention. As for Miemeng, it only expelled the remnant soul and didn't sense this shadow.Hence, the shadow got this chance."Such a method…" Saintly Star looked at Xu Qing as killing intent flashed in his eyes."So what?""The weak are ultimately the weak. Even if I lose one life fire, I can still suppress you with the power of the five fires!" The combat strength of five fires erupted as he charged toward Xu Qing.However, this time around, the killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes was completely released.This was because he could see all of the other party's movements clearly. The other party's speed was now the same as his. Hence, Xu Qing also moved.His speed was extremely fast, like lightning. In the blink of an eye, he came into contact with Saintly Star in the mid-air.Saintly Star's eyes narrowed. Xu Qing's speed surprised him.He slapped down with his right hand. Xu Qing's expression was calm and his eyes were cold as he punched out. As the two of them crossed paths, Saintly Star let out a cold snort. He performed a series of hand seals and flicked his sleeve; immediately, a huge force spread out and his fingers stabbed toward Xu Qing's eyes.Xu Qing's left hand formed a seal and a dagger manifested, slashing at Saintly Star's neck.Saintly Star kicked toward Xu Qing. Xu Qing dodged it and leaped up, heading straight for Saintly Star's chest. At the same time, he waved his hands and fiendish fire erupted in all directions.A sharp glint appeared in Saintly Star's eyes. He clenched his hands and smashed them down.A loud sound rang out like a large bell!A series of rumbling sounds continuously erupted in all directions, causing the weather to change and the world to tremble.Xu Qing and Saintly Star's figures couldn't be seen clearly by outsiders. They could only hear rumbling sounds and terrifying fluctuations that kept exploding. Countless buildings on the ground kept collapsing, as though an invisible hand was sweeping over them.It was incomparably intense.At the next instant, Saintly Star's figure appeared in the air and retreated by more than 100 feet. A hint of surprise appeared in his eyes as he stared fixedly at Xu Qing and suddenly spoke."There is something wrong with your body!"

Chapter 349 Battle Of The Divine Sons
Almost at the instant Saintly Star spoke, Xu Qing moved closer and punched out.Saintly Star immediately waved his hand to block it. He then retreated and the light in his eyes grew even brighter."Let me see what's wrong with your body!"Xu Qing didn't say a word. The killing intent in his eyes intensified as he immediately closed the distance.The two of them instantly collided again. It was unknown what method Saintly Star used but his entire body shone with golden light that shot in all directions, forming a sea of light. Xu Qing had no choice but to dodge. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' The instant he dodged, the sea of light formed one shining rune after another that chased after Xu Qing.These runes contained lethality. The moment they got close, they transformed into sealing power as well. For a moment, the sky emitted a halo and the ruins on the ground shook.When Xu Qing was bombarded and sealed by the sea of light runes, there was a hint of excitement in Saintly Star's eyes. Clearly, he had already guessed it and was only short of confirming it.He performed a series of hand seals with his left hand and took three steps back. With each step, he performed different hand seals.At his first step, a chilly wind rose around him and lowered the temperature of the surroundings.At his second step, wisps of green light formed around him and quickly gathered in front of him into the shape of a sword embryo.At his third step, the sword embryo rapidly grew from the size of a palm to 100 feet, until it transformed into a 1000-foot-long sword.This sword was completely green and seemed illusory. It emitted an astonishing aura that was enough to shake one's soul.The three steps were completed, but the magic power in Saintly Star's body was still dense. His eyes revealed a bright light as he pointed his right hand at Xu Qing. His voice seemed to have fused into the wind."Soaring Cloud Soul Severance!"Flames erupted from Xu Qing's body, forming a sea of fire that shattered the light runes layer by layer. His eyes narrowed when he saw the large green sword.At the next instant, this large green sword slashed toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing dodged but the sword seemed to have locked onto his soul, making it impossible for him to dodge.A sharp glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes and he decided not to dodge anymore. He performed a series of hand seals with both hands and pressed forward. The flames in his body soared into the sky.The large sword instantly got close. The moment it came into contact with him, it shrunk greatly as it entered Xu Qing's body.In the blink of an eye, it completely entered Xu Qing's body, transforming into a soul-severing force that headed straight for his soul.The instant the soul-severing sword rushed over, the black umbrella formed by the life lantern in Xu Qing's body materialized in front of his sea of consciousness, forming a protective barrier!A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He couldn't conceal it anymore.He already knew that his life lantern couldn't be kept hidden when fighting against a strong enemy like Saintly Star. After all, it was impossible for his strength to increase out of thin air. The shadow was already doing its best to suppress Saintly Star's magic aperture.Since that was the case, hiding was useless. It was better to reveal his cards to find a way to kill him.At that moment, the soul severing sword blasted onto the black umbrella that was covered with black flames.Like an egg hitting a rock, the soul severing sword shattered into countless green lights. As the black umbrella rose, the green lights were forced out of Xu Qing's body.From afar, countless green light spots shot out from Xu Qing's body. At this moment, a canopy appeared above his head!The black canopy emitted a strange aura. There were also black flames falling from the eaves at the edge of the canopy, as though they were flowing. This caused Xu Qing, who was standing in the air, to be incomparably eye-catching!All the cultivators in the surroundings who were paying attention to this battle were shocked.Not only did Saintly Star see it, but everyone in the surroundings also saw the canopy."Life lantern!!!"Saintly Star's eyes widened and waves of emotions surged in his mind. His breathing became hurried and his entire body and mind were filled with ecstasy.He had already seen that something was wrong with Xu Qing earlier. Xu Qing clearly had the combat strength of three fires. Even with the addition of an emperor-level cultivation art, it was absolutely impossible for the latter to fight with him until now. The instant he saw the black umbrella, his doubts were confirmed.He immediately understood why Xu Qing could suppress Sima Ling and why Xu Qing dared to fight him.He finally had the answer.Xu Qing's expression was calm with not even the slightest hint of panic. Although the exposure of the life lantern was very significant, Xu Qing felt that if he could snatch Saintly Star's life lantern, his combat strength would similarly reach six fires with two life lanterns.'The risk of being exposed will be much lower if I kill this Saintly Star. If the news still spreads, at most, I'll leave the Seven Blood Eyes and fly far away, hiding my identity!''Although I will have to abandon the benefits from the main city's port, everything will be worth it if I obtain Saintly Star's life lantern!' Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he readied himself.However, Saintly Star laughed at the sky and waved his hands. Immediately, a hundred streams of sword qi formed in front of him. As he waved his sleeve, these sword qi suddenly headed straight for the ground below.Under the horror of the cultivators outside the temple, these sword qi pierced through their bodies.Miserable cries rang out immediately. These sword qi didn't dissipate and spread out layer by layer, killing everything in its path.Saintly Star wanted to silence any cultivator who saw Xu Qing's life lantern!The appearance of the life lantern was a huge matter. He wouldn't allow this news to spread.This was because he already believed Xu Qing's life lantern to be his. When he thought about how his combat strength would rise to an unimaginable level of seven fires, he felt intense excitement.He also knew that life lanterns were even more meaningful to the Heavenly Palace Golden Core cultivators. A life lantern could allow the Golden Core to directly open a Heavenly Palace in the life fog!Two life lanterns meant two palaces!As such, he didn't recall the Dao Protectors who had gone out.He was worried that those three people wouldn't be able to control their greed. After all, his life lantern and Xu Qing's life lantern were different!The reason why he could reveal his life lantern was because there were very few people in the Yinghuang Province who could snatch it away. Moreover, he only had the right to use it and it didn't really belong to him. However, Xu Qing's… was different!'This is a life lantern that completely belongs to him!! How dare he!''The number one heaven's chosen of the Seven Blood Eyes has hidden himself so deeply!'For the first time, a hint of greed appeared in Saintly Star's eyes as he laughed loudly."I didn't expect my opportunity to be here. Xu Qing, my life lantern is with you!"As he spoke, Saintly Star's entire body emitted a golden light. The Miemeng on his back manifested in the golden light, revealing its entire body.Its body was a thousand feet long. It had a green body, a red tail, a long beak, and a large stomach. It looked extremely ugly and peculiar. After it appeared, Miemeng let out a long cry. When it looked at Xu Qing savagely, Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. Black flames erupted from his back and spread in all directions. At the same time, the Golden Crow appeared behind him. Its tail flames swayed and shook the surroundings.At the next instant, Xu Qing charged forward with vicious killing intent.Saintly Star also rushed over with a greedy expression.In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing and Saintly Star came into contact in mid-air. This time, it was even more intense than before.Previously, the two of them had mainly used their physical strength against each other. They didn't use many spells and didn't use their emperor-level cultivation arts either. They were observing the other party's weak points.At this moment, the battle had already reached its climax. Both sides no longer probed and attacked with killing moves.Saintly Star's emperor-level cultivation art, Miemeng Devours the Heaven Art, transformed into the ferocious bird, Miemeng, and tried to devour the Golden Crow.Xu Qing's Golden Crow formed by Golden Crow Refines All Life revealed endless ferocity as it sucked fiercely at Miemeng.From afar, Miemeng emitted a golden light and the Golden Crow emitted black flames. One devoured while the other inhaled, one grabbed while the other refined.Xu Qing and Saintly Star kept intertwining in the air as they exchanged blows after blows. Sometimes, Xu Qing would be blasted to the ground and he would rush out to fight again.Sometimes, Saintly Star was sent flying far away and collided with the buildings. The buildings collapsed and he also rushed out immediately.As the two of them fought, the sky distorted and the ground shattered. Seeing that they couldn't do anything to the other party, they used their life lanterns.The black flames of Xu Qing's black umbrella carried a terrifying might while the rainbow colored canopy of Saintly Star emitted streams of light that formed an unfathomable power. Both suppressed each other, stirring up an even more violent rumbling storm.A moment later, the power of their respective emperor-level cultivation arts and life lanterns was activated at the same time and ruthlessly blasted into each other.Both of them spat out blood and were sent back due to the collision. With the Dao Temple as the center, they each retreated 1000 feet and stood in the sky, as though they were splitting the sky into two!Saintly Star was dressed in a golden Daoist robe. The surrounding golden light formed a sea that illuminated the earth. There was a rainbow-colored canopy on his head that flowed with light. Behind him, Miemeng roared sinisterly as though it wanted to devour the sky. Coupled with Saintly Star's extraordinary appearance, he was like a young ruler who had descended into the world.It was like he owned the world!Xu Qing was dressed in a purple Daoist robe. The black sea of fire in his surroundings burned the sky, and the black canopy on his head was sinister and flowed with flames. The Golden Crow spread out its wings on his back and its eyes revealed cruelty as though it wanted to refine the world. Its tail flames flowed through Xu Qing's entire body, making it look like he was wearing the emperor's robe!Coupled with Xu Qing's peerless appearance, he was like a young ancient sovereign walking into the human world.Peerless throughout all ages!Saintly Star stared at Xu Qing with an intense gaze. While he was filled with killing intent, he had to admit that Xu Qing was indeed very strong. He had qualifications to be an ancient sovereign.In fact, if he were to be placed in the small worlds outside the world of Wanggu Continent, such combat strength would allow him to fight a Nascent Soul cultivator.The level of the Wanggu World was extremely high. According to the ancient records he had read, there were countless small worlds outside the Wanggu Continent before the fragmented face of the god arrived.The cultivators in those small worlds were extremely weak. Those at the Perfected Foundation Building realm only had the combat strength of one life fire.Compared to the Wanggu Continent, the difference was too great.

Chapter 350 The Sun And Moon Fight For Glory
Xu Qing stared at Saintly Star.He admitted that the other party was very strong and was the strongest enemy he had encountered since he stepped onto the path of cultivation.This was even after he used his shadow to cover the other party's magic aperture, causing his combat strength to be reduced by one fire.Otherwise, Xu Qing knew that he wasn't a match.Even with one less fire, the other party's methods were still abundant. His emperor-level cultivation art was astonishing and he had countless divine arts. His life lantern's defense even blocked Xu Qing's poison.'If I obtain his life lantern, my body will also be protected and my defense will be even more perfect!'Xu Qing's killing intent grew even stronger as he stared at Saintly Star's neck and the life lantern canopy above his head.When Xu Qing looked at Saintly Star, Saintly Star was also staring at Xu Qing. Among the cultivators of the same realm he had fought in the Yinghuang Province, Xu Qing could basically be ranked among the top three.He had not expected to meet such a person in a small place like the Nanhuang Continent."It seems that the ancestor is right. A great era has arrived and it contains great opportunities. Heaven's chosens appear frequently and demons rise everywhere. Once I fuse Xu Qing's life lantern into my body, not only will I be able to instantly increase my combat strength by another life fire, but the more important part is the Heavenly Palace.""The value of the life lantern is not only reflected in the Foundation Building realm but also the Heavenly Palace Golden Core Realm! Once I fuse with his life lantern, the moment I break through to the Golden Core realm, with the two life lanterns, I can first project two palaces in the life fog.""One palace means the power of six fires. As soon as I step into the Golden Core Realm, I will possess the power of at least 12 fires. After nurturing my cultivation for a period of time and opening the true first Heavenly Palace, I will be able to obtain the power of 18 fires!""There's also his emperor-level cultivation art. If I kill him and devour his Golden Crow Refines All Life, my Miemeng's chances of entering the second level will be even greater!""Advancing an emperor-level cultivation art is extremely difficult. Even the descendants of those ancient sovereigns and rulers were unable to advance their emperor-level cultivation arts to the second level at the Foundation Building realm. In fact, it was very difficult for them to advance their cultivation arts even when they reached the Golden Core realm. If they succeed, the enhancement from an emperor-level cultivation art will no longer be the power of one life fire but six fires like the Heavenly Palace!""If I succeed, the moment I step into the Golden Core Realm, I will possess the power of 18 fires. Moreover, I'll be able to reach 24 fires very soon. With such combat strength, I'll be the undisputed number one heaven's chosen of the Yinghuang Province. I'll then use this identity to join the Sword Holder. My path will soar and I'll be able to reach Fenghai County!"Saintly Star and Xu Qing occupied two sides of the sky. On Saintly Star's side, rainbow light filled the air, causing the ground to turn colorful.At Xu Qing's side, the surroundings were pitch-black. Black flames burned the sky, emitting rumbling sounds. The two of them stared at each other from afar and could see the rising killing intent in each other.At the next instant, they moved at the same time.From afar, it looked like two different skies were colliding.It was Miemeng and the Golden Crow, these two legendary divine birds, emitting cries as they tried to devour the other.It was two canopies erupting with their respective divine lights.It was a life-and-death battle between the young ruler and the young ancient sovereign.The sounds spread in all directions, and the sky changed colors!As the sky seemed to be about to explode, Xu Qing and Saintly Star each attacked with all their might. Their bodies trembled violently and they had no choice but to retreat."Damn it, if my six-fire combat strength was still here!" Saintly Star's expression was gloomy. The life fires in his body burned as he tried his best to expel the black shadow on the 120th magic aperture. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' However, no matter how intense his flames were, the shadow persisted. It was desperately blocking the magic aperture that was like a volcano mouth, preventing the magic power in it from spreading out at all, causing Saintly Star's fourth ball of life fire to be unable to form.The killing intent in Saintly Star's eyes intensified. As he retreated, he saw Xu Qing's body sway in the distance and approach him with sharp killing intent.A hint of determination appeared in his eyes. He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out blood."Ghost Cloth, seal the body and soul!"As he chanted, the mouthful of blood instantly grew to a thousand feet in the blink of an eye and formed a blood-colored robe that swept toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. The Golden Crow behind him let out a cry and the black flames spread out. However, the blood robe actually didn't care about the damage and spared no expense to forcefully arrive and wrap around Xu Qing.A sealing power erupted from it, causing Xu Qing's body to involuntarily stop in mid-air.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The Golden Crow behind him cried and the life lantern canopy above his head burned, wanting to disperse the power of the seal.At this moment, Saintly Star lifted his right hand and formed a seal."Heavenly Blood Sword!"In an instant, his right hand turned red and the qi and blood in his entire body churned. A blood light erupted from the top of his head and headed straight for the sky.Upon closer inspection, there was a flying sword in the blood light!The sky trembled as though dragons were swimming in it. Amidst the majestic rumbling, the entire sky turned blood red as though it was enveloped by a blood-colored curtain.In the blood-colored sky, a huge sword tip appeared. The range of this sword tip was a thousand feet. After it appeared, it suddenly sank, revealing an even more majestic sword body.There were a large number of marks on the sword and countless broken limbs.As soon as this sword appeared, the sky seemed to shatter. At the same time, the blood light around the sword transformed into a sea of blood that formed a huge vortex.A terrifying force erupted from within, gathering at the tip of the large sword. Amidst the shocking sight, the blood-colored large sword descended vertically upon Xu Qing!It was extremely fast and arrived before Xu Qing in an instant. Xu Qing wanted to dodge, but the blood robe used all its strength to restrain him even though it was burning!A sense of danger stirred in Xu Qing's mind. He looked at the large sword and used the protection jade given by Lord Sixth without any hesitation.The large sword landed and pierced into the protective barrier.Rumbling sounds rang out like thunder, resounding through the clouds.The protective power rapidly weakened and Xu Qing's body trembled intensely as he was pushed down by the astonishing force from the large sword.A cold glint flashed in Saintly Star's eyes. He waved his hand at Xu Qing."Soul Shaking Demon Suppression Sword!"A second blood light rose from the top of his head. It also had a flying sword that started growing rapidly, forming a second blood-colored sword in front of him!This sword was the same length and shape as the falling sword from the sky. The marks on it were the same as well. However, it didn't descend from the sky but transformed in front of Saintly Star. It slashed toward Xu Qing like the autumn wind sweeping away leaves!The second large sword swept through everything in its path like it was cutting butter. Wherever it passed, all the buildings instantly collapsed and the ground caved in as though it was being pressed.A force that could overturn mountains and seas exploded at this moment. Xu Qing's expression darkened. The second sword arrived before him and slashed at his barrier.When the large sword in front of him collided with his barrier, both swords erupted with terrifying power, causing Xu Qing to suffer injuries even though he was inside the barrier.However, the killing move from Saintly Star wasn't over. Almost at the same time that the Heavenly Blood Sword and Soul Shaking Demon Suppression Sword were displayed, he put his palms together and pointed at Xu Qing."Northern Ghost Inquires the Heaven Sword!"As soon as he finished speaking, ghosts appeared in the blood-colored vortex in the sky above Xu Qing. These ghosts were strange in that they didn't have faces and were all carrying swords on their backs.They gave off cold presence and even emitted sharp sword qi. After they appeared, they immediately descended from the vortex and surrounded Xu Qing.A total of eight ghosts had their backs facing Xu Qing. As Saintly Star let out a low shout, the eight sword ghosts moved in unison. They grabbed the swords on their backs and turned around, slashing at Xu Qing!The sword qi churned like the sea and slashed out eight times at Xu Qing!The speed of these eight swords was too fast. They were sudden like the rainstorm and also like bolts of lightning that instantly landed on Xu Qing's barrier.At this moment, a total of ten swords were attacking the barrier. After the consumption in the Starfish Island and persisting for so long, Lord Sixth's defensive jade was finally exhausted and the barrier collapsed.As it dissipated, more than half of the ten swords dissipated. However, some sword qi still entered Xu Qing's body and headed straight for his life fires.Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. Although he finally burned the blood robe outside his body completely with the help of this collapsing force, the sword qi inside his body still caused him to cough out a mouthful of blood.Seeing Saintly Star approaching, the aura in Xu Qing's body became unstable. He didn't hesitate and quickly retreated. The life fires in his body flickered as he used all his strength to suppress the sword qi.All of this took a long time to describe but in reality, everything happened in the blink of an eye. As Xu Qing retreated, Saintly Star caught up to him in the blink of an eye and was ready to attack.However, Xu Qing suppressed the sword qi in his body at this moment and turned around, his eyes revealing ruthlessness.He ruthlessly swung his right hand at the approaching Saintly Star. Immediately, the mosasaur manifested behind him in all its majesty. The moment it appeared, it pierced through Xu Qing's body and devoured the approaching Saintly Star.Saintly Star's expression darkened. He spread out the protective barrier of his life lantern and resisted with all his might.The mosasaur collapsed but it still caused Saintly Star to take a few steps back. Ripples spread on the life lantern's defense like water. However, Xu Qing's counterattack wasn't over. Almost at the instant the mosasaur was destroyed, the magic ship appeared.He didn't use its divine attack. If he did that, the power would be scattered which wasn't suitable for this situation.As soon as the magic ship appeared, Xu Qing controlled it to collide with Saintly Star. There was also the power of self-destruction.Saintly Star had just destroyed the mosasaur when the magic ship appeared before him. He didn't have time to dodge as Xu Qing's magic boat directly self-destructed. A deafening boom rang out in all directions and the divinity contained in the magic boat and its own power transformed into terrifying energy fluctuations that spread out.Saintly Star trembled and his expression was sinister. However, he was still sent back by the impact and his life lantern's defense fluctuated intensely. As he was sent back, Xu Qing performed a series of hand seals with both hands. A purple heavenly saber suddenly formed in the sky above his head and slashed down.It wasn't over. Xu Qing finally activated the poison he had set up in the surroundings. It instantly enveloped the surroundings and targeted the life lantern's defense, forming a corrosive power that rapidly weakened it!The reason why he was willing to exhaust Lord Sixth's protection jade earlier and waited until now was all to stall for time as he thought of ways to shatter the life lantern's defense!Otherwise, with the life lantern's protective barrier still around, this battle wouldn't be easy.Hence, he needed time to add more poison and adjust its effects, allowing the poison that permeated this place to be more effective in corrosion. Only then could he unleash its strength the instant it was stimulated!As the heavenly saber slashed down, the poison intent erupted.

Chapter 351 Counterattack
The purple heavenly saber descended.It slashed at the barrier of Saintly Star's life lantern. Saintly Star's heavenly saber also slashed out and collided with Xu Qing's heavenly saber, both collapsing immediately after.Saintly Star was sent back due to the force of the collision.However, Xu Qing's attack wasn't over. Everything before was a cover-up. It was all for the sake of the Diamond Sect's ancestor's all-out attack.Bolts of lightning erupted from Xu Qing's collapsed heavenly saber.The lightning was controlled and molded in the shape of a spiral which caused the speed of the black iron stick to increase again.The Diamond Sect's ancestor clearly knew the importance of his mission, especially when he saw the shadow playing such an important role. He was already extremely nervous.He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to complete the mission, so he went crazy. He spared no expense and exploded all the lightning runes on the iron stick for even more speed and power. Like a ray of true heavenly lightning, the iron stick collided with the defense of Saintly Star's life lantern just as he retreated.The life lantern's defense was indeed astonishing. It didn't collapse even from the violent collision. However, the extreme speed and rotational force of the black iron stick pierced a small hole in it. At the next instant, the black iron stick was swept back by the backlash from the barrier and became extremely dim. One could vaguely hear the Diamond Sect's ancestor letting out a mournful cry. Clearly, the backlash this time had injured even his spirit body.As for the small hole, it quickly returned to normal."If you can't destroy my life lantern's protective barrier, everything you do is useless."The corners of Saintly Star's mouth curled into a cold smile but he continued to be forced back. Xu Qing's attacks were like a storm, coming wave after wave at an extremely fast speed.First, it was the mosasaur, then the magic ship's self-destruction, and the heavenly saber. Although they couldn't break the life lantern's defense, their power was extraordinary.Because of the existence of the protective barrier, the attacks could not reach him at all. Just like how his attacks earlier couldn't reach Xu Qing and could only shatter his barrier.Overall, Saintly Star was slightly stronger. The divine arts he grasped were clearly more. As he retreated, Saintly Star's eyes gleamed. He could see Xu Qing's weakness."Your spells are too few and you lack divine arts that can display great power!" Saintly Star's gaze was like lightning. Ever since the battle began, Xu Qing had been on par with him. At this moment, he finally saw Xu Qing's weakness.Hearing Saintly Star's words, Xu Qing's gaze turned even colder.Saintly Star let out a long laugh and performed a series of hand seals with both hands. He was going to exploit Xu Qing's weakness. Just as he was about to use his divine art, his expression suddenly darkened.The life lantern barrier outside his body actually dimmed a little at this moment. Ripples appeared on it, especially at where the black iron stick had pierced earlier. Saintly Star felt a sense of corrosion spreading there.This reminded Saintly Star of the poison he had sensed on the battlefield between Xu Qing and Sima Ling in the Seven Blood Eyes."It's difficult for a minor art of poison to reach the Great Dao!"Saintly Star let out a cold snort. He had a special physique and didn't care about ordinary poisons. He casually waved his hand and his life lantern flickered, emitting a brilliant light that dispelled the corrosion on the protective barrier instantly as though it was purified.After doing this, he was about to attack when his expression changed drastically.An intense piercing pain spread throughout his body. His skin instantly turned greenish-black and dense anomalous substances spread in his body, causing his life fires to sway."What!!"Saintly Star's breathing was hurried and his mind shook. He could sense that he was poisoned. This poison was too violent and sudden, causing his vision to blur. At this moment, a sense of danger filled his entire body.This poison was none other than the little black bugs.In reality, the little black bugs had been clinging tightly to the barrier of the Saintly Star's life lantern. However, they couldn't penetrate the barrier and were waiting for an opportunity.The hole created by the Diamond Sect's ancestor gave them this opportunity. The moment that hole appeared earlier, a large number of little black bugs had entered through it.Saintly Star was right in that Xu Qing indeed lacked powerful divine arts but it was also wrong. Although Xu Qing didn't have many powerful divine arts, he had poison!The instant the little black bugs' poison erupted, the killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes intensified and he rushed toward Saintly Star.He had been waiting for this opportunity since the start of the battle. Now that he saw that Saintly Star had been poisoned, he instantly got close and punched out.The Golden Crow appeared behind him and the black canopy above his head shone. Coupled with Xu Qing's five fire combat strength, this punch carried great lethality. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' Under the effects of the poison, Saintly Star couldn't dodge at all. Even though he retreated rapidly, Xu Qing still caught up and punched his protective barrier.A heaven-shattering sound rang out as Saintly Star's entire body trembled violently. His body rolled back like a kite with a broken string. Xu Qing caught up and punched again.Saintly Star's breathing was hurried and his eyes were bloodshot. While resisting Xu Qing with his barrier, he quickly circulated his emperor-level cultivation art, causing Miemeng to emit a sharp sound and rush into his body to remove the poison.At the same time, the rainbow canopy above his head emitted a resplendent light, wanting to force out the poison in his body. However, with a wave of Xu Qing's hand, the large black umbrella directly enveloped the top of Saintly Star's head and ruthlessly suppressed the rainbow canopy.Booming sounds rang out as Saintly Star spat out blood. At that moment, he was enveloped with danger both inside and outside his body. An unprecedented feeling of life and death appeared in his mind.Saintly Star was forced back again and again. Xu Qing continued to use everything he had. Punch after punch, heavenly saber slashed down one after another, the Golden Crow inhaled with all its might, and the Diamond Sect's ancestor continued to risk his life to pierce Saintly Star.The shadow also seized this opportunity. When Saintly Star focused on removing the poison, it spread toward the second magic aperture.It was a full-scale attack!Saintly Star kept retreating while coughing blood. Every mouthful of blood contained poison that corroded the ground when they landed on it.The life lantern barrier outside his body shone intensely. In the end, Xu Qing grabbed it with both hands and smashed it ruthlessly.BOOM! The protective barrier of Saintly Star's life lantern finally couldn't resist and dissipated. The poison in the surroundings gushed in even more wildly. Saintly Star's expression was filled with anger but he didn't continue fighting. Instead, he quickly fled."What poison is this!!" Saintly Star roared in his mind. He originally had six fires strength and could have easily suppressed Xu Qing. It was all because of that black shadow that his combat strength decreased. Now, the other party's poison was also extremely terrifying.This made him want to go crazy. He was in an extremely sorry state with his messy hair and the golden robe that looked much dimmer.If any disciple of the Seven Sects Alliance was here and saw this scene, they would be shell-shocked. This was because they had never seen Saintly Star like this.Saintly Star felt aggrieved and extremely angry. However, when he saw Xu Qing rushing over again with monstrous killing intent, his breathing became hurried and he sped up his escape. At the same time, he took out a jade slip and quickly transmitted his voice, summoning the three Dao Protectors he had arranged to go out and search for what he needed to return immediately.However, his Dao Protectors had been out for a long time and didn't expect him to encounter any danger here. Hence, even if they received the message now, it would still take time for them to rush back.What Saintly Star lacked now was time. The poison in his body was still erupting and his combat strength was rapidly falling. Xu Qing was pursuing him madly and the Golden Crow was also rushing forward, wanting to refine Saintly Star.Miemeng appeared and resisted Xu Qing's punch with all its might. With the help of Miemeng, Saintly Star barely resisted Xu Qing's attack but he was still injured. Xu Qing's expression was sinister as his head slammed forward fiercely, directly colliding with Saintly Star's face.Saintly Star let out a miserable cry. His face was covered in blood and madness appeared in his eyes. He wanted to struggle and retreat, but the black fiendish fire on Xu Qing's body erupted and formed a large mouth that enveloped Saintly Star.Xu Qing wanted to refine Saintly Star's soul and use it as the fuel to open his magic apertures.The madness in Saintly Star's eyes intensified. He let out a mournful cry and his golden Daoist robe suddenly swelled and exploded.This Daoist robe was also a treasure. When it exploded, it formed a violent force. Saintly Star borrowed this force to retreat. After this time period, his life lantern finally suppressed the poison in his body.This caused the swaying of his life fires to calm down a little. However, he knew that he couldn't hold on for too long as Xu Qing continued to chase after him with killing intent. Hence, he didn't hesitate. The instant his injuries calmed down, he let out a low shout and took out an item from his storage ring.This was a broken piece of wood. It should be part of a wooden object.After he took it out, a terrifying energy fluctuation instantly erupted from the wood. The strength of this energy caused Xu Qing's expression to change. He felt that the life fires in his body were about to be extinguished and his magic apertures were shaking. Even his soul showed signs of leaving his body.In fact, even the sky and earth was affected. All the vegetation in the surroundings instantly withered.Countless vitality gathered crazily from the surroundings, causing the wood to transform into a pitch-black wooden door with countless fingernail scratches on it in the blink of an eye.A strange and sinister feeling spread out as this door appeared. The nail marks on the black wooden door were especially shocking. One could even see brown blood among them.Moreover, these scratches were of different depths and seemed to have been left for different amounts of time. The feeling they gave off was as though countless people had once used all their strength to tear at this door.Terror spread uncontrollably.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he immediately made a retreat.The madness in Saintly Star's eyes deepened. He rose into the air behind the door and pointed at Xu Qing."Open!"The black wooden door creaked and slowly opened toward Xu Qing.

Chapter 352 Violent And Wicked
The wooden door was mottled by time and exuded an ancient aura. It was like an old man who had experienced countless years and seen through the hearts of people.The decay contained in the darkness of the wooden door was like the old man's helplessness against this tragic world.It was oppressive, strange, and sinister.This was the feeling this door gave Xu Qing.The moment the black door opened, Xu Qing could sense that everything in his surroundings seemed to have fallen silent and all sounds had disappeared.The wind stopped moving, and so did the clouds and fog. Even his heartbeat seemed to have stopped at this instant. This was the case for everything, including his rapidly retreating body and Saintly Star, who was standing above the door.It was as though the power of this door was too vast and mystical. Regardless of whether it was the user or the target, they would all be stripped of their right to move.Xu Qing had experienced this feeling before. Four years ago, when the song rang out in the forbidden zone of the scavenger campsite, he saw the pair of female boots and the fog walking over from the jungle.At that time, he felt the same thing. Following the appearance of this wooden door, a similar chill that was enough to penetrate his very soul, as though it could freeze his thoughts appeared.Xu Qing's breathing stopped and white frost appeared on his brows and hair. His body was invaded by the extreme cold from the inside out. At this moment, he lost vision of everything other than the slowly opening door.An ear-piercing creaking sound rang out as the black door gradually opened. It was pitch-black inside, as though there was nothing there. Only the cold intent spread out even more intensely. One could even see waves of thin white gas spreading out from the edge of the door.Saintly Star's expression was sinister and the killing intent in his eyes was intense. This door was called the Mystic Spirit Perpetual Will Door. It was a supreme treasure even to him, but he had only used it once since he obtained it.Both sides would be suppressed when he used it, so he didn't dare to use it rashly after that one time. Most importantly, using this door consumed his soul.This door was extremely strange and had a mysterious origin. It was unknown what would appear after opening it, so its lethality varied from person to person. His grandfather had told him about this.The last time he used it, a rotting tongue appeared from the door. This made him extremely uncomfortable because his grandfather had said that what this door manifested was the heart of the target.At that moment, he really wanted to know what would appear inside the door when Xu Qing faced it."It's best if an evil ghost appears, an evil ghost that will tear him apart!!"The instant Saintly Star shouted inwardly, inside the black wooden door, the endless darkness suddenly changed at this moment. A beam of light actually appeared!At the start, this light was still very weak, only a dot. However, in the blink of an eye, it continued to spread and expand. In the end, it transformed into a sea of light that was extremely resplendent and bright.It then spread outwards, turning into countless streams.Wherever it passed, the sky outside the door turned from dark to bright. It was the same for the surrounding ground and countless plants. At this moment, Xu Qing's figure was enveloped by this bright light and drowned in the sea of light.In this sea of light, Xu Qing's entire body emitted an indescribable intense pain. It was as though his entire body was being burned, including his organs.This light penetrated his body, his soul, and everything else. Wherever it passed, it brought intense pain that caused green smoke to rise from his body, as though he was about to be erased. While he was unable to withstand this light, it was also because of the appearance of this light that he regained his mobility and retreated abruptly.He retreated with his full speed but he still couldn't stop the burning of this light. It was as though he had become the night and this sea of light wanted to tear the darkness apart.His skin was burned to pitch-black, his body lost its moisture, and his hair and brows turned to ashes. Regardless of whether it was the life lantern or the emperor-level cultivation art, they were both resisting with all their might.He also took out a jade slip and held it in his hand. His expression revealed a hint of hesitation but in the end, he didn't crush it and sped up his retreat.When Xu Qing retreated in his inhuman form, Saintly Star saw this. However, there was no joy on his face at all. Instead, he showed disbelief. In fact, he couldn't believe his own eyes. An intense sense of absurdity rose in his mind."Light?""After the Mystic Spirit Perpetual Will Door opened toward you, it actually released light!!""How is this possible? You've killed countless people like me and walked on their bones. You're even proficient in evil poison art and cultivate the soul devouring fire. Your entire body emits black flames and even your life lantern is black. It isn't an exaggeration to call you a demon, but the image in your heart is actually light!!""Ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous!""Being in the darkness and having light in your heart?" Saintly Star's eyes were red and his expression was sinister. He had already lost his composure and couldn't control his emotions. The door actually emitted light!This was what he yearned for!!His Dao title was Saintly Star. The word Saintly Star represented light. However, what appeared when he opened the door was a rotting and disgusting tongue. With this comparison, the killing intent in his heart soared again.When he noticed Xu Qing had already retreated out of the range of the light inside the door, he made a series of hand seals. Immediately, the door closed with a bang. After that, it instantly blurred and the direction of the door was no longer facing Xu Qing but himself.He was poisoned and could only suppress it for a short period of time. Taking out this door wasn't just to kill Xu Qing. His true thought was to use this door to suppress the poison.He had used this door once before. At that time, he had used this door to erase the curse he had been planted with.He gritted his teeth. As the Mystic Spirit Perpetual Will Door moved, the black wooden door instantly opened toward Saintly Star. It was still black inside but in the blink of an eye, a rotting and disgusting tongue quickly stretched out and headed straight for Saintly Star.Immediately, Saintly Star's body trembled and his expression was filled with pain. His body rotted from the contact of the tongue. His handsome face seemed to have turned into a zombie and his hair fell off. A stench spread out from his whole body.However, the results he obtained after paying these prices made him very satisfied.At this moment, more than half of the poison in his body was instantly dispelled. The remaining poison also seemed to have lost its vitality and was suppressed. However, what shocked him was that the black shadow on the 120th magic aperture was actually safe and sound under the power of the strange door.Not only that, but it even revealed a small eye and cast a disdainful gaze at him."What is this!!!" Saintly Star trembled violently but he didn't have the time to think. The instant the poison was suppressed, he put the wooden door away and didn't dare to continue using it. He took out medicinal pills and swallowed them in large mouthfuls before chasing after Xu Qing.Xu Qing, who was in the distance, suddenly lifted his head. His entire body was in a sorry state but his killing intent was still intense. Although his injuries were very serious earlier, the purple crystal was rapidly healing him. Moreover, he had swallowed many healing pills when he retreated earlier.At the same time that Saintly Star rushed over, Xu Qing also stomped his right foot fiercely on the ground. As the soil under his feet exploded, Xu Qing's body rose from the ground and met Saintly Star in the air. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' Booming sounds reverberated in the surrounding forbidden region. Countless plants and trees collapsed. The ferocious beasts here also fled immediately. The battle between Xu Qing and Saintly Star was truly earth-shattering.Even a Golden Core cultivator would be horrified by this battle.They moved with extremely high speed, and wherever they passed, there would be explosions and destruction.As they continued to exchange blows, Xu Qing suddenly threw out a crystal. After it exploded, a large amount of black fog spread out. A headless cow rushed out of the fog and slammed toward Saintly Star.This wasn't the end. At the next moment, three more crystals were thrown out by Xu Qing and exploded one after another. A ball of distorted black hair, a withered hand, and a white eyeball flew out.These items of the dead were none other than the items Xu Qing had obtained from the pockets of the God of Wealth, Sima Ling. He used all of them in one go. Immediately, the anomalous substances in the surroundings became incomparably dense. Xu Qing gritted his teeth and even threw out a large number of black pills.As popping sounds rang out, the anomalous substances here instantly erupted. At the same time, they attracted waves of malice from the depths of the forbidden region.Saintly Star's expression changed and he immediately retreated. However, the four bizarre entities were like fish in water in these dense anomalous substances. After they appeared, they actually fused together.That withered hand grew on the neck of the cow's body, and the eye flew over and embedded itself in its palm. The hair covered the cow's body and in an instant, this chimera of a bizarre entity rushed toward Saintly Star.Saintly Star was about to dodge.Resolve appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He waved his hand and took out more than half of Sima Ling's magic artifacts that controlled those bizarre entities. After throwing them all out, he waved his hand.In an instant, these magic artifacts exploded, blocking Saintly Star's escape path, causing him to be unable to dodge. He was directly pounced on by that bizarre entity.Miemeng let out a cry. However, following Saintly Star's weakening, it was also injured. It was also being stared at by the Golden Crow; as soon as it moved out, the Golden Crow instantly arrived and the two sides fought again.Xu Qing also got close. With a wave of his right hand, a dagger appeared in his hand. Taking advantage of Saintly Star's fatigue, he directly slit his neck.Saintly Star immediately moved his head and the dagger rapidly passed by. Although he dodged it, the fiendish fire enveloped him. However, Saintly Star was also extraordinary. His life fires spread out and blocked the fiendish fire, but it wasn't able to stop Xu Qing's madness.Xu Qing lifted his head and ruthlessly knocked into Saintly Star.Saintly Star's eyes were bloodshot and he actually used his head to collide with Xu Qing's head.With a boom, the two of them felt dizzy and were forced back a few steps.Xu Qing's cruelty made Saintly Star feel extremely depressed. However, his killing intent didn't decrease. Today, he had to kill Xu Qing and snatch his lantern.As he retreated, Saintly Star slapped the space between his brows. It was unknown what secret art he used but his right hand actually penetrated the space between his brows and entered his head. He then pulled out a bloody brush!This brush was very small but when it was pulled out of the head, it instantly grew larger. The tip of the brush was a head. This head looked exactly the same as Saintly Star!"Brother, I was sleeping. Did you wake me up to play with me?"

Chapter 353 Spirit Sea Suppresses The Evil Brush
This brush was a bizarre entity!Xu Qing only took a glance before his pupils contracted.This brush was half the height of a human. It used the spine of a human as the shaft, the head as the ferrule of the brush, and the hair as the bristle!There was still flesh and blood on the spine. Although the head was intact, its skin was green like a malicious ghost. Its eerie words after it appeared caused Xu Qing to frown.As for Saintly Star, he turned a deaf ear to this. He waved his hand and controlled the strange brush to draw a circle in the air.The instant this circle was drawn, it directly turned from illusory to corporeal. Its color was red and it rapidly spread out in all directions. Like a violent wind, it blew at Xu Qing's face.As for the chimeric bizarre entity, it suddenly trembled as though it was suppressed. The cow's body trembled and retreated before directly collapsing. After it returned into four parts, they collapsed again and completely dissipated.Saintly Star turned around and looked at Xu Qing with reddened eyes. The head of the brush in his hand emitted a dark glint in its eyes. It also looked at Xu Qing and licked its lips with its long tongue as it spoke."Brother, are you going to kill him? He's so beautiful. After we capture him, how about you use the method you used to deal with me back then? Refine him in your body and snatch his aptitude, turning him into a second brush."Saintly Star snorted coldly. In terms of bloodline, this brush was refined from his younger brother. However, he had suppressed and refined his younger brother many years ago and the latter became his treasure. The ancestor and many others in the sect knew about this.However, as long as the ancestor tacitly agreed that only one of them could live, the others wouldn't be able to say anything.This was because he, Saintly Star, was born with a peculiar nature. He and his younger brother were born as conjoined twins and were connected above the waist.Such a situation wasn't an exception in the countless years of history of the Wanggu Continent. In reality, there were many situations where life was changed by the arrival of the god due to the integration of anomalous substances.Even though people or other beings looked normal and there seemed to be no anomalous substances, in reality… the influence had already appeared from the source of their bloodline.It was just that no one knew if this influence would be revealed in that generation.Even so, this was unacceptable to Saintly Star. As such, ever since he had his own consciousness, he had wanted to kill his younger brother and his younger brother also had the same thought. In the end, he came out on top."Sure, kill him. I'll allow you to do this!" When he heard his younger brother's words, Saintly Star spoke gloomily.Saintly Star's younger brother's eyes lit up and its entire body emitted astonishing anomalous substances. At the same time, its eyes revealed a pitch-black light. When it looked at Xu Qing with a greedy expression, Saintly Star waved his hand and drew the strange brush in the shape of a cross toward Xu Qing!In an instant, the cross shone with a deep red light. It transformed from illusory to real and completely took shape. The cross seemed to be made of blood but was also like skinless bloody flesh, covered in tendons.After it was formed, the fleshy cross whistled toward Xu Qing.Wherever it passed, the bizarre entity's aura filled the air, causing the weather to change.Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. He held the jade slip in his hand which details were not clear. He seemed to want to crush it but ultimately gave up.With a boom, the fleshy cross shot over and came into contact with Xu Qing.Xu Qing coughed out blood and rapidly retreated. A strange laughter rang out from the fleshy cross and it was about to pursue. However, Xu Qing's speed wasn't slow. He frowned and stared fixedly at the fleshy cross that was chasing after him.By now, he and Saintly Star were both heavily injured, and their weaknesses were clearly displayed. Xu Qing was aware that compared to Saintly Star, he was indeed lacking some divine arts.In reality, if the person he was comparing with wasn't Saintly Star, Xu Qing's spells were actually alright. However, Saintly Star was a heaven's chosen who wanted to walk the path of the ancient sovereigns and rulers nurtured by the Soaring Cloud Sword Sect with all their might. Naturally, he had a lot of spells and magic artifacts."I lack divine abilities and spells, and my magic artifacts aren't as abundant and varied as his. However… strength can defeat ten techniques!" A sharp glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The purple crystal in his body was showing its great power as it continued to heal his injuries rapidly.At the same time, the advantage of the 5,000-foot-long spirit sea in his magic apertures was the same. This caused his Mystic Brilliance Form to still be full of power even after activating it for so long. What Xu Qing wanted to do now was to rely on his dense spirit sea that surpassed others to suppress Saintly Star.The instant the fleshy cross whistled over, Xu Qing's body suddenly rose into the air. His eyes revealed a bright light as he lifted his right hand toward the sky.At the next instant, the 92 magic apertures in his body erupted again. The fiery power inside surged. After that, a huge 5,000-foot-long palm directly appeared in the sky above Xu Qing!This 5000-foot-long palm was formed by the spirit sea in one of his magic apertures. The instant it appeared, as the magic apertures in Xu Qing's body shone, a second 5000-foot-long palm appeared.It overlapped with the first palm, forming two layers of power.This wasn't the end. As the magic apertures in Xu Qing's body continued to erupt, three layers, ten layers, thirty layers… Layers of palms instantly overlapped at an extremely fast speed, causing the density of the palm to be increasingly high.In an instant, violent winds scattered in all directions and a strange pressure descended from the sky.This scene caused Saintly Star's eyes to widen and waves of emotions to surge in his mind. The spirit sea in Xu Qing's magic aperture was too shocking. In his entire life, he had never seen anyone's spirit sea reach such a terrifying level.Even he had only reached over 2,000 feet!"You…" Saintly Star's expression changed drastically. He was very clear that the spirit sea in the magic apertures represented the density of magic power. Although this advantage wasn't great at the start, as the cultivation deepened and the number of magic apertures increased, this advantage would become incomparably terrifying.This was the case.In an instant, the palms above Xu Qing's head directly stacked 92 times!From afar, the instant the palms stacked 92 times, the world rumbled. The pressure was so great that lightning bolts appeared at the edges of the palm. They were like snakes and dragons roaming in the edges as they spread out.The palm's aura was so terrifying that it seemed to want to devour the heavens!Even the fleshy cross that was chasing Xu Qing stopped in mid-air, revealing intense fear.Xu Qing didn't have the sword divine arts like Saintly Star in which every sword strike was peerless. He also didn't have a bizarre object like the black door, or an accompanying treasure like the fleshy brush.However, he had 92 layers of 5,000 feet of spirit sea!No matter how strange you are, no matter what spells you use, no matter what items you show, I'll suppress them all!At the next instant, the veins on Xu Qing's forehead bulged. It was as though the 5,000-foot-long palm that had been stacked 92 times had an indescribable heaviness. His body emitted cracking sounds and tendons bulged on his arm. He then pressed fiercely toward the fleshy cross and Saintly Star!The might of the 92 times stacked giant palm had the power to suppress mountains and seas. It instantly collided with the fleshy cross that was filled with a bizarre aura. A rumbling sound rang out. The fleshy cross lasted for five breaths of time before it dissipated at a speed visible to the naked eye and shattered into pieces.Wherever the large palm passed, everything would be destroyed under its extreme violence. Behind the palm was Xu Qing's figure. He used all his strength to push the power of all of his spirit sea.The ground trembled and countless trees turned to dust. The eruption of terrifying power instantly approached the pale-faced Saintly Star.At this critical moment, determination flashed in Saintly Star's eyes. He let out a low shout and controlled the strange brush in his hand, turning it into a sword that stabbed fiercely at the incoming large palm.The magic apertures in his body also erupted as their power surged into the strange brush, causing the face of his younger brother's head to become even more sinister. Although there was horror in its eyes, there was more madness as though it wanted to die!Waves of sounds rumbled like thunder in the forbidden region.Xu Qing and Saintly Star each spat out a mouthful of blood. Their expressions were sinister and their eyes revealed ferocity as they went all out.As this sound reverberated, the strange brush emitted a piercing light and trembled intensely. As for Xu Qing's large palm, 33 layers of it instantly collapsed.At this moment, the light of the strange brush dimmed a little and a mournful cry rang out. That was the younger brother's madness. However, no matter how crazy it was, it was useless. After 43 layers of Xu Qing's large palm collapsed, the brush bristles broke inch by inch and turned into dust.In Saintly Star's younger brother's eyes, amidst the endless madness, there seemed to be a hint of relief as well. In the end, it flashed a sinister smile as it used all its strength to collide with the palm again. This collision caused Xu Qing's large palm to collapse by another 13 layers. The price was that the head of Saintly Star's younger brother directly exploded. Before it exploded, its last voice rang out in all directions with sharpness and resentment."Chu Shengyun, do you still remember the curse I planted on you when you refined me? I cursed that in the future, you will be refined like me and your everything will be snatched away. Although you used the perpetual will door formed by the Taboo fragment to erase the essence of my curse, it seems that my curse is still effective!" The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' The shrill sound carried a long laughter. The moment it dissipated, Xu Qing's large palm landed on the brush, destroying it completely. Finally, when there were only 21 layers left, it landed on Saintly Star's body.Saintly Star's entire body trembled violently and he coughed out a lot of blood. The life fires in his body were swaying intensely as though they would be extinguished.His body was sent flying. However, the killing intent in his eyes didn't decrease at all. In fact, there was even a hint of dark light flickering in them."You can curse as you please. You died a worthy death." The moment Saintly Star landed on the ground, his expression revealed madness. He slapped the ground ruthlessly and shouted."Body Curse Myriad Blood Refinement!"As soon as he spoke, Xu Qing's expression darkened.The ground where the dust from the strange brush that had collapsed earlier landed suddenly exploded. Flesh arms rapidly rushed out from within. There were thousands of them and they spread crazily, wrapping around Xu Qing from all directions.At the same time, Saintly Star looked up with a sinister expression and his voice became sinister."Summon my Soaring Cloud's Taboo's projection!"",

Chapter 354 Withered Hand Reaches Toward The Sea Of Consciousness (1)
Taboo!Just like how Xu Qing had the right to use the projection of the sect's magic treasure after he became a Sequence, the heaven's chosens of the Seven Sects Alliance could also use their sects' foundation.However, very few people had the qualifications. Moreover, they were treated as encouragement and protection.After all, the magic treasures of the Seven Sects Alliance were in the levels of Taboo. There were many restrictions when using them. If they wanted to maximize their effect, they needed a specific moment.Saintly Star had extremely rich combat experience. He didn't summon the Taboo projection immediately because he wanted to create an opportunity to perfectly use the power of the Taboo.He had realized that it wasn't very easy to snatch Xu Qing's life lantern. He had to prevent the other party from escaping at the critical moment or use a jade talisman like the disorder teleportation.Moreover, he had paid attention to Xu Qing's instinctive actions of wanting to crush a jade slip twice previously. Although he pretended not to notice, he could roughly guess Xu Qing's thoughts.In his opinion, this battle was just fishing.He had to wait for the other party to exhaust all the methods and be severely injured, only then would the process be smoother.Hence, he had been waiting. When he felt that the situation had worsened, he took out the flesh brush during the battle.Regardless of whether this brush could heavily injure Xu Qing or not, he planned to use its destruction as a cover to display the curse power of the flesh brush and trap Xu Qing.This way, he could create an opportunity for himself to activate the Taboo and form an inescapable net. This would make all Xu Qing's escape methods useless and allow him to successfully obtain his life lantern.Xu Qing's expression changed. He was surrounded by flesh hands that were incomparably tenacious. They bound him tightly from every direction, and he was unable to break free. He immediately tried to crush the jade slip in his hand.However, it was clearly too late.In an instant, the sky turned red. This red color appeared abruptly and covered the surroundings in the blink of an eye. It looked demonic and bizarre, turning this area into a blood-colored world that enveloped Xu Qing.Moreover, after this blood-colored world was formed, it emitted the ability to distort space, blocking all teleportation within its boundary. At the same time, the blood world was still shrinking and the range was constantly decreasing. The sealing power continued to erupt, as though it was isolating this place from the outside world and completely sealing it off.A red seed appeared in this blood world.However, this seed was different from when the seed that had appeared in the Minor Affairs Sect. This blood-colored seed was illusory and not corporeal, but its might was also very astonishing. After it appeared, it fell to the ground and transformed into a blood-colored tree.As soon as this tree appeared, a violent pressure spread everywhere. The tree swayed slightly; Xu Qing shook violently and he spat out blood. It was as though an indescribable force wanted to erase him.Saintly Star laughed loudly. His eyes revealed greed as he used all his speed to head straight for Xu Qing.Miemeng let out a cry behind him and the life lantern canopy above his head shone. He wanted to completely kill Xu Qing in this sealed space and snatch the life lantern."In the seal of the Taboo projection, only one of us can leave!"Saintly Star got close and attacked. Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood and kept retreating. Not only was there a sealing power here, but there was also a suppression, causing the life fires in his body to sway intensely.Seeing that the strange tree was about to sway, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he spoke in a low voice."I summon Seven Blood Eyes' magic treasure projection!"The Seven Blood Eyes also had a magic treasure but it hadn't reached the level of Taboo. Xu Qing had never summoned it either.As soon as he finished speaking, this blood-colored world instantly shook. The sky churned as though an external force had descended, wanting to tear this world apart. An eye vaguely appeared in the sky.This eye showed no emotions. After it appeared in the sky, it stared at the projection of the Taboo magic treasure below.The projection of the Taboo magic treasure shook. However, it was obvious that there was a difference in levels between the two sides. The Taboo projection didn't collapse and the sealed Blood World didn't shatter. Xu Qing couldn't escape from it.However, this was a magic treasure projection after all. After it appeared, although it couldn't open the Taboo realm, it still froze the blood tree inside, preventing it from swaying. The suppression on Xu Qing was reduced but it was still there."A mere lower sect's magic treasure can't shake my sect's Taboo. Xu Qing, this blood world is your burial ground!" The greed in Saintly Star's eyes intensified. He laughed loudly and quickly chased after Xu Qing with all his might.Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. The Golden Crow behind him cried out and resisted with all its might. It was the same for black umbrella life lantern. It spread black flames everywhere as Xu Qing continued to fight against Saintly Star in the sealed blood world.Xu Qing was suppressed by the blood world, so he had clearly weakened. He began to retreat in defeat. When Saintly Star saw this, his aura soared and became increasingly violent.A while later, when the blood world shrunk to less than 100 feet and the large tree inside also shrunk, a rumbling sound rang out. Blood flowed out of Xu Qing's mouth as he retreated. He held a jade slip in his hand and quickly looked around."You don't have to look anymore. You can't escape from here. Even I can't control this world. I can only let it dissipate on its own."

Chapter 355 Withered Hand Reaches Toward The Sea Of Consciousness (2)
"All my previous actions were to seal you here. You have a teleportation talisman in your hand, right? You were hesitating before, but there's no need to crush it now. You have lost all possibility of escaping from here!"Saintly Star smiled sinisterly as he strode toward Xu Qing, looking at the latter like he was looking at a dead person.'The seal is indeed flawless." Xu Qing continued to survey his surroundings. After confirming that it was as Saintly Star had said, he calmly spoke. At the same time, he threw away the jade slip in his hand and took out an iron box. He opened it and threw it to the side.The jade slip wasn't a teleportation talisman but an extremely ordinary message slip.The iron box was none other than the wish box. It contained the poison pill that even the monk head couldn't resist.As soon as the pill was exposed to the world, its aura spread out.This scene stunned Saintly Star and his eyes narrowed. He didn't know what that pill was but he instinctively felt that something was wrong and wanted to destroy it. However, Xu Qing used all his strength to stop him and stall for time, causing the aura emitted by the poisonous pill to increase.As this place was sealed tightly, the poison pill's aura couldn't drift outside the seal. It could only gather in the blood world that was still shrinking. The poison aura here naturally became denser and denser.This was Xu Qing's plan.Xu Qing didn't know what trump cards Saintly Star had and he couldn't take any precautions against them. Moreover, the two of them were evenly matched, so Xu Qing couldn't kill him in a short period of time to obtain the life lantern. The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' Xu Qing knew that he lacked time. Once the Dao Protectors arrived, he would definitely die.Hence, he was clear that there was only one way to end this battle as soon as possible.That was to let Saintly Star use his methods step by step according to his thoughts and create a similar sealed environment. That was why he had taken out the jade slip many times and given Saintly Star the illusion that he was trying to use a teleportation talisman.He was taking advantage of Saintly Star's greed.If Saintly Star wanted to snatch the life lantern, he had to block Xu Qing's escape and restrict teleportation. Xu Qing used this point to control the rhythm of the battle.Xu Qing was letting Saintly Star carry out this battle step by step until he set up a battlefield that looked suitable for him but was actually more suitable for him. On this battlefield, he wanted to compete with Saintly Star on who could live the longest under the life-ending poison!Saintly Star was a smart person. Although he didn't know how powerful the poison pill was, he had a guess. As his expression changed, killing intent flashed in his eyes. He took out a large number of antidotes and swallowed them, wanting to continue attacking.However, at this moment, his expression changed drastically. He saw that his right hand had actually begun to rot. What frightened him even more was that he hadn't felt anything at all. He quickly retreated to check his entire body.With just one look, his pupils contracted. He noticed that many parts of his body were silently rotting. As for his antidote pills, they were completely useless!"What poison is this!"While Saintly Star was shocked, some rotting spots appeared on Xu Qing's face. However, they were clearly much smaller and fewer. He didn't answer Saintly Star's question and rushed out, starting to counterattack.He wasn't going to give Saintly Star any chance. He wanted to drag this battle into a competition of recovery and resistance to poison.For the first time, horror appeared in Saintly Star's eyes. He wanted to try and disperse the seal formed by the Taboo magic treasure, but what he said earlier was true. It was very difficult for him to remove this seal, let alone that there was an eye formed by the projection of the Seven Blood Eyes' magic treasure suppressing it.Under the double suppression, it became impossible for him to disperse the seal of the Taboo magic treasure. He could only wait for it to dissipate on its own. This time wasn't very long. At most, it would take two incense sticks of time.However, the horror in Saintly Star's eyes grew increasingly dense. He discovered that the rotting area of his body was getting larger and larger. At the same time, the shadow in his magic aperture was also stirring, as though it was about to spread.Xu Qing's attack was unprecedentedly savage. At this moment, he got close and threw a punch over. Saintly Star dodged but Xu Qing slammed him hard with his head. Saintly Star didn't dare to collide this time and could only retreat.However, Xu Qing's speed didn't decrease. He attacked with all his might without dodging. As he attacked, the Golden Crow erupted and refined crazily. Black flames filled the air and the life lantern suppressed Saintly Star again and again.Moreover, Xu Qing's target was either the neck or the stomach.He targeted the neck to kill and the stomach to dig out the life lantern.Xu Qing had a life lantern, so he knew where it was.Saintly Star became increasingly flustered. He let out a mournful cry and took out a large number of medicinal pills to replenish his vitality. There was also madness in his eyes amidst the horror. A life-and-death crisis filled his entire body. He understood that this battle was a competition of who could survive.Since he couldn't avoid it, he would go all out. His eyes were bloodshot as he fought back amidst the increasingly dense poisonous aura.Sounds of attacks continued to ring out. A while later.Xu Qing was bleeding from many parts and his entire body was rotting. However, he still punched Saintly Star's abdomen. Saintly Star raised his hand to resist and was forced back. His entire body was dripping with rotting water and he was completely disfigured like a wet clay statue.Xu Qing rushed forward again and lifted his knee to ruthlessly strike the stomach. Saintly Star roared, but there was only an unintelligible sound. His internal organs were rotting and he could only try to defend with his hands.

Chapter 356 Withered Hand Reaches Toward The Sea Of Consciousness (3)
However, at the next instant, because more than half of his right hand had rotted, his right hand directly shattered due to the knee strike. Xu Qing's knee didn't feel good either and cracks appeared on it.However, he didn't care at all. He pounced over and bit down on Saintly Star's neck.The madness in Saintly Star's eyes was replaced by intense fear. He quickly retreated but after taking a few steps back, his right leg began to melt. His body involuntarily tilted and Xu Qing rushed over again. The two of them fought with anything they could use.They were both extremely weakened due to the intense poison. Moreover, they had used all their methods in the battle and had reached their limits.Booming sounds continued to echo. Saintly Star was indeed a heaven's chosen. Coupled with his secret arts, medicinal pills, and various methods, he actually lasted for more than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.However, this was already his limit. His eyes revealed despair. The ground was covered in both his and Xu Qing's rotting flesh. Xu Qing didn't look good either and he no longer looked human.However, his eyes were filled with monstrous ferocity. He pounced over again and bit Saintly Star's neck. This time, Saintly Star could not dodge and Xu Qing ruthlessly tore his neck.Blood spurted out of Saintly Star's mouth and neck, and his entire body trembled violently. Miemeng manifested to block but when Xu Qing's ferocious gaze swept over, Miemeng was also affected by Saintly Star and shook violently. The Golden Crow took the opportunity to inhale with all its might amidst Miemeng's wails.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing was panting heavily, the rotting had permeated his internal organs. However, he still chased after Saintly Star like a vicious wolf and punched Saintly Star's stomach.Saintly Star let out a muffled sound of pain. Just as he tried to crawl away again, Xu Qing ruthlessly knocked his head against Saintly Star's forehead. As Saintly Star wailed, Xu Qing's head was bleeding and his body emitted an incomparably weak feeling. However, this time, he finally found an opportunity as Saintly Star was unprecedentedly weakened.He used all his strength to pierce into Saintly Star's stomach!His right hand entered Saintly Star's body and grabbed a magic aperture. After that, it shuttled to his sea of consciousness and felt a lantern-shaped item.Xu Qing's eyes revealed excitement. Under Saintly Star's mournful cries, he grabbed the life lantern!Before blood could gush out of Saintly Star's stomach, two of Xu Qing's five fingers melted. However, the remaining three still hooked onto the life lantern and… pulled it out!Amidst the blood-colored seal, the rainbow light shone from Xu Qing's hand. It was a… rainbow glazed lantern!!The body of the glazed lantern was like a crystal. It emitted a dazzling rainbow light and vaguely transformed into a dazzling rainbow canopy from which light flowed out like water.This lantern was stained with blood and an ancient aura spread out.It was as though it had experienced countless years and the vicissitudes of time. One look and one could tell that it was definitely not an ordinary item. There were also countless runes that seemed to contain the laws of heaven and earth arranged in a human-shaped pattern. Just a glance at them would cause one's mind and soul to shake.Any one of the life lanterns was a supreme treasure! The source of this content is n/ov/elbin[./]net' "Xu Qing!!" Even though his throat was corroded, Saintly Star still let out a sound filled with madness and hysteria as he stared fixedly at Xu Qing.The feeling of having his life lantern dug out from his body made him go crazy.However, at the next instant, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The five fingers on his left hand melted, revealing the bone tip. Without the slightest hesitation, the bone tip of his arm directly pierced through Saintly Star's neck!
