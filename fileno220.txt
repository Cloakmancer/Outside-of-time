"Captain, you're poisoned." Xu Qing glanced at the captain."Poisoned? I'm not poisoned. I'm so strong, how could I be poisoned?" The captain raised his brows and answered in surprise."You are indeed poisoned, Captain."Xu Qing looked at the captain's greenish-black face that looked similar to the pitch-black seawater and said seriously.The captain's expression turned solemn."Vice Captain Xu, don't spout nonsense. You have to have evidence when you speak! I just saw a tasty-looking sea fruit, but after eating it some wind <anno data-annotation-id="260094ef-5b10-420c-946f-ce2dc8b931b8">evil</anno> entered my body. Looks like you can't eat sea fruits casually."As the captain spoke, he seemed to feel his face turning a little numb. He quickly took out a handful of antidotes and stuffed them into his mouth as though he was eating candy. He then chewed and swallowed them.As for his heart, he was feeling rather depressed at this moment. He had hidden himself after falling into the water earlier because he wanted Xu Qing to scout the way first while he followed behind.He didn't expect this kid to release poison all the way!Now that he saw that Xu Qing was about to speak, he hurriedly swept his gaze across the surroundings and suddenly pointed at Zhang San, who was disguised as a corpse in the distance."Eh, isn't that Zhang San?"The captain quickly left Xu Qing and ran toward Zhang San. When he reached Zhang San's side, he kicked him. However, Zhang San, who was disguised as a corpse, quickly dodged. He lay on the ground and lifted his head to see the captain as well as Xu Qing walking over."Captain, are you poisoned?" Zhang San looked at the greenish-black color on his captain's face in surprise."Shut up." The captain coughed and quickly spoke."Don't be a disgrace. What good stuff can you get by pretending to be a corpse here? Follow me. I know where the good stuff is." The captain immediately checked his surroundings and rushed in a direction.Zhang San didn't hesitate. He jumped up from the ground and greeted Xu Qing before chasing after the captain."Vice Captain Xu, the place I'm going to has the Foundation Building Pill you want. Come quickly." The captain waved at Xu Qing as he ran.Xu Qing's gaze was restrained as he swept his gaze across the chaos of the battle in the surroundings. He then looked in the direction the captain had left in. That place… was also the place guided by the Spirit Breath Lantern. He no longer hesitated and quickly followed the captain and Zhang San.Just like that, the three of them left the merfolk race's underwater battlefield. As they were strong, although they encountered some obstructions on the way, they were all easily dealt with.The captain was clearly in a hurry. When he saw merfolk cultivators blocking the way, he would directly release cold air, turning them into ice sculptures.As for Zhang San, his style was different from the captain's. He had a lot of trinkets of all kinds. Moreover, they were all the kind that would explode upon contact and had high lethality.As they moved forward, Zhang San threw them in all directions, preventing the merfolk from approaching.What he used the most was a thread that was difficult to see with the naked eye. As his body moved, this extremely sharp thread moved in the surroundings, slicing the ice sculptures that the captain made.Clearly, the two of them had cooperated more than once and were already very familiar with each other's methods. Hence, their speed became faster and faster.In fact, Xu Qing even saw Zhang San tying a thread to the captain's body. This made it very easy for Zhang San to move forward.As for Xu Qing, his attacks were different from the captain and Zhang San. To be precise, he didn't attack at all. Instead, he used a colorless poison powder that he had developed specifically to target the merfolk race. It fused into the water and permeated his surroundings.As he moved forward, the bodies of all the merfolk who neared him melted. Even though they retreated rapidly, they couldn't stop the corrosion of their bodies. They let out mournful cries and their eyes were filled with extreme fear as they faced the unavoidable death.Zhang San's expression changed drastically. He quickly took out a large number of antidote pills and swallowed them. He then moved forward at full speed, wanting to keep a distance from Xu Qing who was behind him.As for the captain, he had been eating the antidote pills one by one.Just like that, the three of them sprinted wildly and slowly left the battlefield. Xu Qing could also see the direction the captain was heading in. It was the place where the divine priests had come from. This made him fall into deep thought.An hour later, when the rumbling sounds from the battlefield were much weaker, a strange building complex appeared in front of them.Although these buildings were also made with coral, they were pitch-black, forming towering circular halls. From the style, it was somewhat similar to the cluster of temples Xu Qing had seen in the scavenger campsite."Temple?" Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. The guiding fluctuation from the Spirit Breath Lantern seemed to be coming from here but it wasn't convenient for him to take it out to confirm it."This is the place." The captain's excited voice rang out from ahead. He sped up and headed straight for the temple.Their arrival aroused the vigilance of the merfolk guards in the temple. They rushed out one after another to kill them. However, there weren't many guards.If it was any other time, this place would definitely be heavily guarded. However, now that the merfolk race was facing a calamity, many places in the underwater world were in the middle of chaotic battles. As a result, most of the divine priests had left, so the number of guards here was clearly reduced.With the captain's strength, Zhang San's many trinkets, and Xu Qing's colorless poison, they were able to rush straight to the center of the temple cluster.During this time, Foundation Building cultivators whose cultivation levels had been suppressed to the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm also appeared. However, wherever the captain passed, everything would be frozen. No matter what cultivation level the enemy had, their outcome was the same. They were all instantly turned into ice sculptures.This scene caused Xu Qing's heart to tremble. Not only was he wary of the captain's combat strength, but he was also certain that the captain had a strong motive for coming here.From the start, he seemed to be headed straight for this place."Could it be that the captain has the same goal as me?" Xu Qing was vigilant. As he silently followed, the vigilance in his heart grew even more intense.A moment later, the three of them killed their way to the center of the temple cluster. In front of a blue temple, the captain quickly spoke."Zhang San, set up traps in the surroundings. Take out all your good things, I'll compensate you when we get back.""Xu Qing, scatter more of your poison here. Don't be stingy. I'll compensate you too when we get back!"Zhang San immediately set up a large number of mechanisms in the surroundings that would explode with a single touch. Moreover, all of them had disguises covering them, and were placed in confusing and tricky areas. For example, he dug a pit to bury a trap. Moreover, this pit was only slightly deeper than other areas. It would trigger with a step."The first person who walks on it will be fine, but the second person who walks on it will trigger the explosion." Noticing that Xu Qing was looking at him, Zhang San grinned honestly.Xu Qing fell silent and recalled the location guided by the Spirit Breath Lantern's fluctuations. He sensed that although it was also here, it didn't seem to be in this direction. It should be further deeper.He heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. After Zhang San finished setting up, he took out a lot of poison powder and scattered it, causing the danger in the surroundings of the temple to increase even more.After that, Xu Qing looked at the captain.The captain was very happy. He directly pushed open the temple's gate and called Xu Qing and Zhang San in.The interior of the temple was empty and didn't seem to have any treasures. There was only a statue standing there."Captain, what exactly are you doing this time? There's nothing here. The things I want aren't here as well!" Seeing that the surroundings were empty, Zhang San was anxious.Xu Qing didn't say anything and also looked at the captain."Don't be anxious." The captain squatted and smiled."Wait a moment. I guarantee that you'll be able to obtain what you want in a while." As he spoke, he took out a withered eye. This eye didn't look like a human's. After the captain placed it to the side, he performed a series of hand seals and pointed.Immediately, the withered eye opened, revealing a blurry scene in its pupils. It seemed to be the outside world of the island."Let's watch the show first." The captain's expression was filled with excitement."Eye of Consonance, this thing is very expensive. How did you get it?!" Zhang San took a deep breath and quickly moved closer to take a look.Xu Qing also carefully looked at the eye. He felt that it was very strange. He then swept his gaze across the captain and retreated a little. He surveyed his surroundings and began to observe the environment here.There was indeed nothing else here other than the statue.Even though the statue itself was only made from coral and didn't have any divinity fluctuations, Xu Qing didn't relax. He remembered that the stone statue holding the saber in the temple in the scavenger forbidden zone also didn't look anything strange.He didn't plan to stay here for long and was prepared to find an opportunity to leave.While Xu Qing was observing, the ground trembled. A loud explosion rang out from afar, like a storm sweeping in all directions.As the ground trembled, a sharp sound rang out in the distance, as though it could penetrate all obstacles and spread throughout the entire underwater world.The place where the explosion and sharp sound came from was the battlefield where Xu Qing's group had left earlier. At that moment, corpses were everywhere and many people had died. As for the dozens of divine priests, all of them were in a sorry state.Most of the strange beasts formed by their divine arts were also dead. All of them let out sharp cries in their madness. As this sound rang out, their bodies rapidly burned.They seemed to be using the burning of life to cast an extremely powerful divine art. As their sharp sound spread, although there weren't many divine priests on the many battlefields in the underwater world, they also burned their bodies and let out sharp cries.These sounds fused together and became stronger and stronger. The penetrative power also continued to grow.As hundreds of divine priests on the entire Binding Island burned crazily, the sharp sound directly spread out of the Binding Island. It passed through the array formation outside and continued to travel into the depths of the sea.It was like a summoning!Very soon, a roar that came from the deep sea echoed.This voice was like the sound of heaven and earth, containing indescribable intimidation.The instant it spread out, it caused monstrous waves to surge in the sea for thousands of kilometers. As it continued to spread, the sky changed color and the wind and clouds churned.In the depths of the sea… a huge figure vaguely appeared!This figure was a hundred thousand feet tall and astonishingly huge, like a god.Its every movement seemed quite strenuous. However, at the same time, every step it took would cause the bottom of the sea to rumble and form a tsunami.A terrifying pressure erupted at this moment.Regardless of the cultivation base of the countless sea beasts in the vicinity, they all trembled under this pressure. A pressure that caused the souls of all the Seven Blood Eyes cultivators to tremble spread out from the god-like figure at the bottom of the sea.The rumbling sound continued to transmit. If one had eyes that could penetrate the sea and looked at it from a high altitude, they would see an old woman wearing a robe made of countless fish bones with a large number of tentacles on her body walking toward the merfolk island step by step.Her face was covered in wrinkles and more than half of it had rotted away. Only her golden eyes revealed a deep look with no emotions. Her breath was filled with dense anomalous substances and contained intense divinity.The tentacles on her body all had eyes and were also golden. At this moment, half of them opened and they looked at the distant merfolk island in unison.

Its tongue contained countless souls.Upon closer inspection, these souls looked like divine priests of the merfolk race. They were all emitting sharp sounds, as though they were responding to the voice of Binding.This scene caused the array formation fluctuations on the four islands of the merfolk race to dissipate a little and become transparent, allowing the cultivators on the island to finally see the outside world.This figure was none other than the god the merfolk race believed in… Binding!<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="260094ef-5b10-420c-946f-ce2dc8b931b8">Wind evil in Traditional Chinese Medicine means external pathogenic factors that can cause various ailments</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 192 Why The Madness?
The god the merfolk believed in was called Binding.However, its title of god was crowned by the merfolk race in reverence. In reality, it was just a mysterious divine existence at the bottom of the sea.Even so, divine creatures that could go to deep sleep at the bottom of the sea were extremely powerful. Their abilities were unimaginable to many races, and their strength even more so.Before the god's fragmented face arrived, although there were sea monsters in the Wanggu Continent and the surrounding Endless Sea, they were far inferior to the creatures that were changed due to the god's fragmented face.Such existences that possessed the aura of the fragmented face of the god in the sky appeared one after another. These existences were known as divine creatures.Some races had studied these divine creatures and found that they had evolved from the bizarre entities in the forbidden zones.Binding was one of them.In fact, to mortals, it could indeed be considered a god.This type of divine creature had occupied the top of the food chain for many eras and was regarded as a god by countless small races. Even large races were wary of it.However, many eras had passed, the races that could survive in this world all had their own methods to resist divine creatures.In fact, some races could already intimidate ordinary divine creatures. There were also large races that could fight against the emperors of the forbidden regions.As for the human race, although they were scattered in many places, they were also one of the large races.At this moment, the surface of the sea rumbled as Binding strode toward the merfolk island. In the air above the merfolk island, Old Master Seventh, who was standing on great wing, looked at the deep sea."Zheng Kaiyi, the arrival of Binding will definitely cause a storm of blood. There's no need for your sect and my race to start a war like this. We are allies. My race is willing to continue to be allies and hand over all the benefits. My race can even help you attack the Sea Corpse Race." The merfolk ancestor's breathing was hurried as he spoke rapidly."It is too late for your race," Old Master Seventh said calmly. He ignored the merfolk ancestor and waved his hand, his voice spreading in all directions."Human race's battle flag!"As soon as he finished speaking, the wyvern transformed from the great wing below him roared at the sky. The thirteen elders in the surroundings lowered their heads with deferential expressions. The hundred Foundation Building cultivators were the same.Amidst their respectful looks, following the wyvern's roar, a huge flag suddenly rose from the tallest building on its back.This flag was a thousand feet long and the color of the banner was mixed. It was stained with the blood of countless beings and looked tattered, as though it was a corner of a large flag.As the wind blew, a peerless baleful aura that shook the world erupted from it.This aura was so strong that the sky seemed to freeze and the waves of the sea seemed to stop.It was as though it could suppress the time, the races, and all existences. Even divine creatures had to lower their heads in front of it.The mixed blood on the flag exuded an intense sense of divinity, as though countless divine creatures had been killed on this flag. Amidst the mixed blood was an extremely pure drop of golden blood.This drop of blood actually gave off a feeling that it surpassed divinity and was infinitely close to the fragmented face of the god in the sky!"The human race's battle flag. It's impossible for the Seven Blood Eyes to possess such a supreme treasure of the human race, even if it's just a corner… This is an item of the Wanggu Continent's Seven Sects Alliance!!" The merfolk ancestor's face instantly turned pale. He seemed to have lost his voice in despair.Just as the miserable voice of the merfolk ancestor echoed, as the battle flag fluttered, a suppressive force erupted from it. An illusory finger stretched out from the battle flag.This finger contained the intent of endless time, as though it had risen from the endless river of time. It didn't emit any pressure, but everyone who saw it felt their minds go blank.It was as though this finger represented the Heavenly Dao. It pressed down slightly toward the sea.Immediately, an area of 50,000 kilometers of the sea surface evaporated, forming a huge hole, revealing Binding who was letting out a mournful roar.All the tentacles on its body opened their eyes at the same time, wanting to resist. However, it was useless. More than half of the tentacles collapsed and the fishbone robe on its body shattered. The tongue on its back withered and the rotting of its entire body sped up.Half of its body exploded, turning into countless pieces of flesh and blood. The remaining half of its body retreated rapidly amidst the mournful cries that spread in all directions, fleeing into the depths of the sea!This scene couldn't be seen on the other three islands of the merfolk race. Only the cultivators on the Binding Island could see it clearly.However, the disciples in the underwater world couldn't see it. Unless one used a special technique or some strange object, only then could the cultivators in the underwater world see everything that was happening outside.For example… the Eye of Consonance.At that moment, in the underwater world, Xu Qing, who was in the temple, had his eyes completely widened. He stared at the Eye of Consonance in front of him with waves of emotions surging in his mind.This eye reflected the great wing in the sky and the flag. It also reflected the evaporation of the surface of the sea and the collapse of half of Binding's body after the finger was pressed down.However, this was already the limit of the Eye of Consonance . At the next instant, the eye seemed unable to withstand the horror of the scene it was observing and exploded.The instant it exploded, the captain did something that shocked Xu Qing and dumbfounded Zhang San.He actually took out a palm-sized piece of red flesh and pressed it against the statue of Binding at the side.Immediately, this piece of flesh and blood melted and enveloped the entire statue. It was as though it was devouring the statue, emitting waves of strange swallowing sounds. After it devoured the entire statue and transformed into a huge piece of flesh and blood, a gap was torn in the middle.It was like a gate of flesh and blood. It was twisting and squirming, and looked unstable. It was the same for the whole lump of flesh and blood, as though it would wither and collapse at any moment.It was pitch-black inside the gap but upon closer inspection, it seemed to be the depths of the sea. Occasionally, some scenes would flash past and one could see a large number of broken limbs and minced meat.Those broken limbs and pieces of flesh were the collapsed half of Binding's body. These were clearly extremely attractive in the deep sea, causing terrifying auras to erupt from everywhere and surge toward the broken limbs, wanting to devour them.These auras were so strong that Xu Qing could clearly sense them through the gap in the flesh. Any one of them could instantly crush and kill him. As for the Seven Blood Eyes elders in the air, they seemed to have some reservations and didn't participate in the fight.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 However, the captain's eyes lit up and his expression revealed unprecedented madness. After taking a look at the gap in his flesh, his eyes turned red as he quickly spoke to Zhang San and Xu Qing."I know what your goals are. I didn't lie to you. When I said I brought you guys here to find treasures, it was naturally to find treasures.""Zhang San, isn't this what you want? The refining diagram of the merfolk race's Flying Fish Armor?"As the captain spoke, he took out a red jade slip from his pocket. It emitted a strange fluctuation. The item in it seemed to have intelligence and seeped out of the jade slip, transforming into the phantom of an armor.One look and one could tell that it was quite extraordinary.Zhang San's eyes instantly widened and he wanted to grab it."Why is it with you!"The captain smiled and allowed the red jade slip to be grabbed by Zhang San. While Zhang San was being excited about the treasure, the captain looked at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, you want the Foundation Building Pills, right? There are three of them here. Their quality is much higher than the normal ones and are extremely precious. They are definitely top-grade pills and can't be compared to ordinary Foundation Building Pills." As the captain spoke, he took out a jade box and threw it to Xu Qing."How is it? You wanted it, right?"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He grabbed it and opened it. There were three blue-colored medicinal pills that gave off a strange fragrance. There were even some mist lingering on them, as though the medicinal pills had life.Xu Qing's mind shook. He kept them and looked at the captain.He didn't believe that his captain would give these things to them so easily."I spent a lot of effort to find this for you. Since I've helped you, the two of you have to help me too. Help me guard this place. It won't be long. Fifteen minutes!""Just the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. When I return, I'll give you some of the items I obtained! If I don't return in the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, you guys can leave on your own. You don't have to care about me.""I'm going to snatch the flesh and blood of Binding. That's the god of the merfolk race. You guys better pray that I don't die inside. If I return alive, we'll be rich, understand?!"When Xu Qing heard this, a huge commotion stirred in his heart. He looked at the broken limbs and minced meat in the gap between the flesh and blood as well as the terrifying auras that were rapidly approaching. He then looked at the madness in the captain's eyes. He felt that the captain was crazy, or maybe the latter felt that he had lived too long, so he wanted to play with his life.Xu Qing had seen such people before. They had only two results, and both were extreme. Either they got themselves killed or… they obtained a huge harvest.Xu Qing hoped that the captain belonged to the latter group, so he asked."How to increase your chances of returning alive?"The captain laughed and quickly spoke."There is nothing you can do. It's up to fate."Xu Qing nodded."What's life for? Isn't it just for fun? I've played with it several times." The captain took a deep breath and the madness in his eyes intensified. He instantly entered the gap in the flesh and blood and quickly crawled inside.It was as though he was courting death as he rushed toward the place where half of Binding's body had collapsed.The moment he entered, the huge piece of flesh trembled violently and traces of withering appeared in its edges, as though it wouldn't be able to hold on for long.Zhang San fell silent. After a long time, he sighed."Have you seen such a Qi Condensation cultivator? He's f*cking going to his death…"Xu Qing shook his head. Right now, even if the captain opened his stomach and said that he was at the Qi Condensation Realm, Xu Qing wouldn't believe him. After a moment, he spoke."Are the coffins in the main city expensive?""I prepared it for him in the past. Later on, I dismantled it because it was of no use. Oh right, I dismantled it when I was refining the magic boat for you. I didn't have enough materials and used them all on you. I'll go back and forge another one…" Zhang San sighed."…" Xu Qing fell silent. After a long time, he looked outside the temple. His eyes slowly narrowed as he spoke softly."Something's coming."Almost at the instant Xu Qing spoke, sizzling sounds suddenly rang out outside the empty temple, as though something was being corroded by poison.This sound was extremely ear-piercing but there was nothing in the outside world.However, the traps that Zhang San had buried exploded one after another.

Chapter 193 Temple Of Mire
This was strange.However, Xu Qing and Zhang San had each seen similar things. In fact, compared to what their captain had done just now, these invisible enemies outside didn't seem to be much.There were not many people who were admired by Xu Qing. The teacher from the slums, Captain Lei from the campsite, and Grandmaster Bai who had taught him about herbs and plants were people he admired from the depths of his heart.But now… there was another one.Xu Qing admired the captain's madness in playing with his life.To dare to go into the deep sea at this moment and risk his life to plunder the flesh and blood of Binding… Only people who were completely crazy could do such a thing. As for the captain's true identity and cultivation, Xu Qing didn't want to guess anymore. It was meaningless."I hope the captain can succeed," Xu Qing said softly.The captain had given him the Foundation Building Pills in exchange for him guarding this place for fifteen minutes. He would keep his promise. He headed straight for the temple's gate.Xu Qing glanced at the empty space outside. He then lifted his right hand and waved it fiercely. Immediately, a large amount of poison powder spread out, merging into the seawater and rapidly spreading out.This time, the poison powder wasn't colorless but had many different colors. Black, red, blue, and green. After they fused together, they transformed into different colors and their intensity increased by a lot.In the blink of an eye, sizzling sounds rang out from the originally empty outside world. There were also intense fluctuations that distorted outside the temple.After that, a fleshy tentacle as thick as a thigh suddenly crawled out from the empty space in front of Xu Qing and lashed out at him.Its speed was so fast that ripples appeared wherever it passed. Moreover, there were more than one tentacle. The tentacles appeared one after another from other places, and rushed toward Xu Qing in unison.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. After he dodged a tentacle that charged at him, he slashed it down with the dagger, cutting it into two.He then attacked the other approaching tentacles.In an instant, flesh and blood splattered everywhere. Because there were too many tentacles, Xu Qing's dagger was entangled. He simply let go of the dagger and grabbed the tentacle in front of him, pulling it ruthlessly.The ground collapsed as a strange ferocious beast that looked like a tadpole was pulled out. The large head at the end of it revealed a sinister huge mouth. It twisted its body and bit at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's expression was calm. The Ba shadow instantly manifested and he punched fiercely at the incoming big-headed ferocious beast.The seawater seemed to explode and the big-headed ferocious beast instantly collapsed.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing rushed toward another tentacle and punched out again.Zhang San, who was in the temple, couldn't help but gasp."Although he can't compare to the captain's madness, this Xu Qing is quite fierce…" Zhang San muttered. He wasn't idle either. He performed a series of hand seals and the fine threads outside his body instantly rushed out of the temple.He could also kill enemies.The rumbling of the mechanisms outside became even more frequent. The places where Zhang San had buried the mechanisms collapsed one after another. Under Xu Qing's mixed poisons, the figures were dyed with colors and revealed themselves.They were all merfolks.However, they were different from ordinary merfolk. They seemed to possess a certain degree of concealment and were even more ferocious. All of them spat out blood and there were traces of poison on their bodies, but they didn't retreat. They continued to charge straight for the entrance of the temple.Their target wasn't Xu Qing but… the piece of meat inside the statue in the temple.It was as though the appearance of this piece of meat could lead to some unknown effects, causing them to frantically try to stop it.However, the instant these merfolk cultivators got close to the entrance of the temple, a rumbling sound suddenly erupted.Zhang San had buried a large number of traps at the entrance. Xu Qing was fine when he passed by them, but when these merfolk got close, the ground directly exploded.The violent impact swept out, causing the merfolk race to retreat one after another. At the same time, Xu Qing, who was fighting against the tentacles, suddenly had a change in expression.He sensed a terrifying aura approaching the temple from the ground."Senior Brother Zhang, carry the statue out!" Xu Qing immediately let out a low roar.Zhang San also reacted extremely quickly. He didn't hesitate to carry the flesh and blood statue and rush out of the temple. As he waved his right hand, the threads surrounding him spun sharply.The instant he rushed out of the temple, the entire temple collapsed. A rotting large hand stretched out from the ground. Since it missed, it slapped the ground and using the leverage, a thousand-foot-long figure crawled out.Thick corpse poison spread out with its appearance.This figure was actually a corpse, and it was formed from a large number of corpses that had fused together. Its hands and feet slapped the ground malevolently as it charged forward like a wild beast, rushing toward Zhang San.Zhang San quickly threw the statue he was carrying toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing leaped up and carried the flesh and blood statue with one hand. As he retreated, he held the dagger in his left hand and slashed the empty space beside him. Immediately, fresh blood spurted out and a head floated down from the concealment.At the same time, the giant corpse in the distance also changed its direction and roared as it charged toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and his speed erupted as he sped into the distance. At the same time, Zhang San seemed to have gained leverage and his body was suddenly pulled closer to Xu Qing.Xu Qing wasn't surprised. When he caught the flesh and blood statue, he sensed a thread on it. It was Zhang San's thread."What is this thing that can allow the captain to enter the deep sea? It even caused these merfolk and sea corpses to go crazy as soon as it was formed." Zhang San approached with a shocked expression.Xu Qing didn't have an answer, but he remembered the captain's words. Protect the statue for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. He threw the flesh and blood statue to Zhang San."Senior Brother Zhang, guard here." After saying that, killing intent erupted from Xu Qing's eyes. He held the dagger in his left hand and the black iron stick in his right. The Ba shadow behind him roared and rushed toward the approaching giant corpse.His speed was so fast that he got close in an instant. As rumbling sounds erupted into the sky, Xu Qing's Ba shadow punched out continuously. At this moment, his poison was also released on a large scale. Wherever he passed, bodies would rot and fall to the ground with mournful cries. As for the huge corpse, it also retreated repeatedly under Xu Qing's bombardment.Finally, under Xu Qing's control, countless water droplets formed a restriction. The moment they trapped the huge corpse, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. With a wave of his hand, his magic boat appeared and the divine power attack instantly shot out.A golden pillar of light that seemed to be able to purify everything broke through the seawater and landed on the giant corpse.Amidst the rumbling, the corpse trembled and shattered into pieces.Xu Qing wasn't willing to waste the divinity. He quickly kept the magic boat, and charged toward the other merfolks in the surroundings.He brandished the dagger and blood filled the air. There was also the black iron stick whistling around him, directly piercing through the merfolks. Although the Diamond Sect's ancestor was still in a deep sleep after being sealed and wasn't awakened by Xu Qing, after this iron stick gained an artifact spirit, it had become extraordinary and its lethality was high.A moment later, this area… was completely cleared out by Xu Qing.His entire body was covered in blood and he clearly felt some fatigue. However, the killing intent in his eyes was still intense.As the baleful aura permeated the air, a hint of Foundation Building intent was also faintly emitted from the black iron stick, as though the Diamond Sect's ancestor was about to awaken.As for the Ba shadow behind Xu Qing, it stood there malevolently, as though it was bearing witness to this massacre.Zhang San's heart trembled at this scene.He looked at the blood on the ground and then at Xu Qing's blade-like figure. He suddenly felt that his previous judgment was wrong. This Xu Qing in front of him might not be as mad as the captain but in terms of cruelty… he was the same as the captain!Most of the corpses on the ground had their necks slit…The time it took for an incense stick to burn was up.However, the captain didn't return.Xu Qing fell silent. He glanced at the flesh and blood statue that Zhang San was carrying and waited for another half an incense stick of time.As for Zhang San, he also sensed that a lot of time had passed and his expression was a little gloomy."Senior Brother Zhang San, the time has passed. I have another area to go to. Take care," Xu Qing said softly. He gave Zhang San a bag of poison and told him how to use it. After that, he walked into the distance.He hoped that his captain would be successful but he wouldn't wait for too long. In this merfolk world, Xu Qing had more important things to do.He rushed out with his full speed. When he reached a place with no one around, he took out the Spirit Breath Lantern and placed it in his shadow to sense the location. Very soon, Xu Qing confirmed the precise location. He then kept the Spirit Breath Lantern and sped into the depths of the temple cluster.  Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ  Time slowly passed. The range of this cluster of temples was very large. After an hour, Xu Qing stopped in his tracks and lifted his head to look at a very ordinary temple in front of him.This temple was no different from the surrounding temples but the location guided by the Spirit Breath Lantern's spirit fluctuations was here.Xu Qing warily surveyed his surroundings. After confirming that this place was empty and with no obstacles, he quickly scattered a large amount of poison in the surroundings, enveloping the entire temple as well as spreading more inside it.Xu Qing didn't act rashly. Instead, he hid and waited silently. Only after he discovered that there was nothing strange did he rush into the temple. The moment he stepped in, he quickly observed his surroundings.The interior of the temple was empty except for a statue.This statue wasn't of Binding but an elderly merfolk. He had a dignified expression and a crown on his head. There did not seem to be anything remarkable about him.Xu Qing swept his gaze over and looked at the walls of the temple.However, just like the emptiness here, the walls were no different. Xu Qing searched for a long time but didn't find anything here. He took out the Spirit Breath Lantern and checked his surroundings again. It was still the same.Xu Qing thought about it and lit the Spirit Breath Lantern. He walked one round around the temple but still didn't find anything.Xu Qing muttered to himself and placed the lantern in his shadow.In an instant, the color of the lamp changed from a dim yellow to a dark green. The light illuminated the surroundings and a portion of it landed on the wall. There seemed to be some changes there.Xu Qing slowly moved closer.As he got closer, the green light slowly illuminated a larger area on the wall. Gradually, the wall distorted. As Xu Qing's mind trembled, a mural appeared on the entire wall from the original blank space.This mural was of a vast scene. The scene seemed to show the location of a huge altar. There were countless bones around it that formed a sea, and on this sea of bones, there were three towering figures.Two of them lowered their heads and bowed, while the other stood tall.Among the two people paying their respects, the one on the right was the merfolk old man in the temple. However, in the mural, he was like the emperor, even more dignified. His majestic body stood there with extraordinary might, and the crown on his head was embedded with a gem.On the other side was an old woman in a fishbone robe that was covered in tentacles. There was also a malevolent ghost face on her back. It was none other than Binding. The figure they worshiped was a giant with nine-headed snakes coiled around its body.This giant wore armor that was filled with countless runes. He carried two worlds on his shoulders and a large sword floated above his head. This large sword gave off a soul-stirring feeling, as though once it landed, it could split heaven and earth apart.He who was being worshiped by the merfolk emperor and Binding seemed more like a god.On his body, a snake head held a burning lantern in its mouth.The shape of this lantern was a black umbrella placed upside down. Its appearance was the same as the Spirit Breath Lantern but it gave off a completely different feeling like they were not on the same level.The difference was like a rock and a beautiful jade.It also contained supreme imperial might, causing everyone who saw it to be able to tell at a glance that this was the genuine item.

Chapter 194 Xu Qing Is Also Crazy! (1)
Xu Qing looked at the mural and his heart trembled. Suddenly, the light from the black umbrella lantern in the mural shone brightly, as though it really existed. The light penetrated the mural and spread out to the outside world.At the same time, the Spirit Breath Lantern in Xu Qing's hand also flashed with an even denser light. It formed a sea of light instantly.Xu Qing's expression changed. He wanted to retreat but it was too late. His figure was enveloped by the sea of light.In the blink of an eye, as the sea of light disappeared, Xu Qing's figure also disappeared!It was as though a long time had passed, but it also felt like an instance.When Xu Qing's perception turned from blurry to clear, the first thing he felt was an extremely terrifying pressure. It was like the roar of a peerless ferocious beast gushing over.There was clearly no sound and it was clearly just pressure, but it still caused Xu Qing's eardrums to buzz so loudly that blood started flowing down from his ears.Not only the ears, blood flowed down his nose too. His eyes also felt such piercing pain that he was finding it difficult to open them.His body churned intensely, as though his internal organs were trembling.All of this transformed into intense pain, causing Xu Qing to not dare to touch anything in the surroundings when he couldn't open his eyes.He squatted and instinctively assumed an attacking posture. At the same time, the poison powder spread in the surroundings and the black iron stick was taken out. Without any hesitation, he directly unsealed the Diamond Sect's ancestor.As the seal was undone, a wail rang out from the iron stick.The Diamond Sect's ancestor woke up. However, in the next instant, he howled miserably."Master, I was wrong. I was really wrong. What is this place? Heavens, here… here…""Master, do you want to throw me here and make me suffer here forever? I've read many ancient books and many of the characters in them were dealt with like this.""Master, I'm really sincere in surrendering and becoming your artifact spirit. Don't kill me. I'm very obedient. I know my mistake. I'll be honest. Actually, I buried a lot of spirit stones in another place. I also promised a lot of money to some fellow Daoists and told them to find you if I lost contact with them.""Master, I'll tell you who they are now. I'll help you kill them!""Shut up!" Xu Qing couldn't open his eyes and gritted his teeth."Tell me what's in the surroundings!"The Diamond Sect's ancestor trembled even more. However, he didn't dare to disobey Xu Qing's words. His life soul was in the other party's hands, and his life and death could be decided with a single thought.As such, he hurriedly spoke with a trembling voice."Master, this place seems to be an altar. The surroundings are filled with a sea of bones. We're at a high place and there's a staircase that goes down in front of us. At the end of it, there's a path with cliffs on both sides. At the end of the path is a circular altar. "Ahead of the altar is filled with bones. Heavens, this place is too big. There are also three colossal statues ahead!""Are the three statues standing side by side?" Xu Qing said in a low voice."No, one is standing and two are bowing." The Diamond Sect's ancestor had no idea that he had circled between life and death."Continue." Xu Qing slowly spoke."That person standing there is a giant with a nine-headed snake wrapped around his body. He's like a god. F*ck!! What the hell is this? I feel like I'm going to go blind just by looking at him. If it wasn't for the fact that I don't have a mortal body and am an artifact spirit, I might really have gone blind… Master, I was wrong. Where is this…"As the Diamond Sect's ancestor dawdled, Xu Qing's heart trembled. He could tell that he was in the world on the murals.After pondering for a moment, he didn't speak. Instead, he casually sealed the Diamond Sect's ancestor and made him continue to sleep. He silently waited for his body to adapt and recover.After the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed, as the recovery ability of the purple crystal in his body continued to spread, Xu Qing slowly got used to the pressure in the surroundings to a certain extent.Although intense pain still filled him and the feeling of his body collapsing didn't dissipate, he still forced himself to open his eyes and see everything in his surroundings clearly.This place was indeed as the Diamond Sect's ancestor had described. The place Xu Qing was in was like a huge cave or another world.The steps ahead were huge and didn't look like a place for humans to walk. In the sea of bones at the front, there were three majestic statues.The unbearable pressure that Xu Qing was facing came from them.Xu Qing's eyes stung and bled. After he gritted his teeth and persisted in sweeping his gaze over, his eyes suddenly narrowed. He saw the black umbrella lantern hanging from the mouth of a snake head that was coiled around the towering giant in the sea of bones.This black umbrella lantern shone with thousands of lights and auspicious colors, illuminating the worlds on the giant's shoulders, making these two worlds lifelike. Xu Qing's breathing instantly became hurried and his heartbeat incomparably intense. His mind was buzzing and his eyes were wide open as he stared fixedly at the black umbrella lantern."Life lantern?"  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  Xu Qing's mind trembled intensely. The captain's description of the life lantern earlier appeared in his mind and an indescribable desire rose in his heart.Although he had guessed it when he arrived, he was still shocked by this scene.There was actually a life lantern here!If this matter was spread, the competition outside would probably end immediately. All eyes would be gathered here and the Seven Sects Alliance of the Wanggu Continent would rush over immediately.In reality, that was indeed the case. Once this matter was exposed, the outside world would definitely go crazy. Compared to this life lantern, the merfolk race was completely unimportant.

Chapter 195 Xu Qing Is Also Crazy! (2)
The merfolk race clearly didn't know about this. Otherwise, they could have sent it to any large faction and obtained protection!If it wasn't for the shadow, Xu Qing would not have found it either.Waves surged in Xu Qing's mind as he looked at the life lantern. However, he didn't act rashly. He took a deep breath and suppressed the waves in his mind.He wiped away the blood flowing out of his eyes. With the continuous recovery from the purple crystal, his current state was slightly better than before.After a long time, Xu Qing calmed his mind and looked at the lantern again. A hint of determination slowly appeared in his eyes.He walked forward until he was right above the stairs. He glanced at the huge steps below and jumped down.However, the instant he landed on the second step, the pressure from this place became stronger than before.Xu Qing's body trembled once again and he felt a sweetness in his throat as he spat out a mouthful of blood. His countenance was extremely pale and his body started swaying. He immediately sat down to regulate his breathing.It took him a long time to recover. He gritted his teeth and continued walking forward. His body was shaking and his seven orifices were bleeding. His bones seemed to be about to collapse and shatter.When he barely got close to the edge of the second step, his body… had reached the limit of what he could withstand. His vision started getting blurry.Xu Qing was clear that he couldn't continue. He had a strong premonition that if he stepped on the third step, he would face a huge danger.He stared fixedly at the life lantern. He was really unwilling to leave just like that, so he looked at the ground under his feet.The light here came from the front, so his shadow was vaguely revealed behind him.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  Xu Qing turned his head and glanced at his shadow. His eyes narrowed as he suddenly spoke."Wake up. Don't you like to extinguish lights? Go and get them for me."As he spoke, Xu Qing immediately began to control the shadow. Immediately, the shadow distorted and slowly retreated to the ground under his feet unwillingly before spreading forward.Due to the position of the light, the shadow that extended forward couldn't be seen clearly. Xu Qing was only able to sense it through his perception. Under his control, the shadow landed on the third step.He didn't feel any discomfort.A sharp glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he continued to control the shadow to extend until the fourth step, the fifth step…Finally, the shadow spread to all the steps and arrived at the altar below. It then continued forward, heading toward the three statues in the sea of bones.Xu Qing didn't have an answer to how long the shadow could extend to.However, he could sense that the more he extended it, the greater the control he needed. At the same time, the shadow seemed to be more unstable.When it was almost near the three god statues in the sea of bones, the unstable feeling of the shadow became increasingly intense and it was unable to continue extending.Xu Qing's eyes were bloodshot. He looked at the life lantern and sensed the shadow. With no other choice, he let out the suppressive force of the purple crystal to see if the shadow could extend if he tried to suppress it.However, before the suppressive force could descend, the originally unstable shadow suddenly trembled. As though it was overdrafting itself, it suddenly extended by a large large measure.It directly spread to the giant's body, only one step away from the life lantern in the snake head's mouth.However, this time, it had really reached its limit. It was shaking and showed signs of tearing.Even though the suppression force landed, it was still unable to continue. In fact, it was about to retreat, as though it couldn't withstand it anymore.Xu Qing's breathing became hurried. However, he didn't trust the shadow. He didn't know if the other party was deliberately not going over or if it really couldn't do it. He stared at the shadow and spoke in a low voice."If I don't get it, then after I get out, even if I die, I'll suppress you a thousand times before I die until I kill you!!"Xu Qing's voice was very calm.However, the lethality contained in it seemed to have reached the extreme for the shadow. The shadow frantically tried to extend forward, but it was obvious that it had reached its limits as the signs of tearing became even more clear.Xu Qing sensed this scene and only then did he believe it in his heart. Determination quickly appeared in his eyes. He took out talismans and the magic boat, fully activating its defense.He then climbed onto the magic boat and took out a large number of spirit stones to place in the grooves of the array formation, increasing its defense.After that, he took a deep breath and controlled the magic boat to fly a step forward without any hesitation, appearing above the third step.The instant he moved forward with the magic boat, the shadow also moved forward by an additional step. It touched the life lantern in the snake's mouth and grabbed it.However, at the same moment, a monstrous rumbling that was much louder than before erupted in front of him. This rumbling formed an overwhelming force that surged toward Xu Qing.His magic boat was the first to collapse. The first layer of defense formed by the sails directly tore apart and the entire magic boat rolled back.After that, the second layer of defense also collapsed and exploded. Even with a large number of spirit stones supporting it, it was useless. As for the magic boat, it rolled back even further.Next was the bow of the ship. The divinity on the sea lizard's skin spread out but it was still unable to neutralize the force, causing it to instantly shatter into pieces. After that, it was the same for the front half of the ship. This force also landed on Xu Qing's several talismans.The protective talismans frantically blocked but the words on them instantly dimmed. After they disappeared, the remaining energy swept over and landed on Xu Qing.Xu Qing trembled violently as though he had been smashed by a mountain peak. He spat out a large mouthful of blood.Many of the bones in his body shattered and his skin and flesh tore. At this moment, his magic boat was already forced back to the limits. As the light in the surroundings shone, Xu Qing and his broken magic boat were suddenly blasted out of the mural.The force of this explosion was so great that Xu Qing's magic boat violently collided with the wall on the other side. The wall collapsed and the magic boat dragged a thousand feet long trail on the ground.Xu Qing spat out large mouthfuls of blood. Many parts of his body were destroyed, revealing his bones that were mostly broken.There was also a huge wound on his stomach that penetrated his body. As for his robe, only parts of it were left.Bood kept gushing out and spreading on the ground. Xu Qing's vision rapidly blurred. His injuries were unprecedentedly serious but he was holding onto an item tightly.That was… the life lantern that the shadow had captured and brought back!"I can't faint!"As his vision blurred, Xu Qing ruthlessly bit his tongue and opened his eyes. With much difficulty, he grabbed a large number of medicinal pills from his storage bag. He didn't have time to eat them, so he directly pressed them on his wounds. He also released poison powder in the surroundings to guard against any danger.He didn't have time to check the life lantern. He quickly put it away and placed it in the storage bead he had obtained from the Diamond Sect's ancestor.He was still worried and placed the storage bead in a storage bag. He still felt that it wasn't safe, so he placed this storage bag in another storage bag. With so many layers, its aura couldn't spread out at all.In addition, the broken magic boat still had some divinity left. Xu Qing didn't have time to feel heartache and immediately controlled the magic boat to disperse the divinity, turning it into a protective barrier that enveloped his surroundings.After doing this, Xu Qing spat out another mouthful of blood. The intense sense of weakness made him feel as though he was being summoned by death. The purple crystal in his body emitted a dense purple light that continued to flow through his entire body.However, the intense pain that followed still caused Xu Qing to groan, but he continued to hold on while gritting his teeth, waiting in torment for the purple crystal to heal him.

Chapter 196 Worth It!
The seriousness of his injuries this time was unprecedented for Xu Qing.Moreover, this was after the two layers of defense on the magic boat and the resistance of divinity had weakened the force. He even exhausted many talismans and the strength of his body at the great circle of perfection before he could barely resist it.Even so, he almost lost his life.Even with the purple crystal's recovery, Xu Qing felt that it would take some time for his injuries to heal. At the same time, lingering fear also surfaced intensely in his mind.Xu Qing felt that if his defense arrangements had lacked even a bit, he would probably have died."But, it was worth it!"Xu Qing gritted his teeth and endured the intense pain in his body as he checked his expenditures.The talismans were one of them. More importantly, the magic boat he had used a lot of money to build had very little divinity left on it.Half of the boat had collapsed. The cost of repairing it would be astonishing.Even so, Xu Qing was extremely excited. He felt that it was all worth it. He had made a killing!"Moreover, I have the replica Spirit Breath Lantern as well!""No wonder the captain risked his life. Once such a venture succeeds, the harvest can be so astonishing…" Xu Qing thought of the captain but he felt that this wasn't a good habit. One day, it would get him killed.Xu Qing took a deep breath and suppressed the excitement. He slowly circulated his cultivation base, trying to speed up the purple crystal's healing power.After all, he couldn't move now and would definitely be in danger if he stayed here for too long.Time flowed by and very soon, an hour passed.Some distance away from Xu Qing within the cluster of temples, Zhang San had dug a cave and sat by the flesh and blood statue while looking at the entrance warily.He had set up a large number of single-use self-destructing items outside the entrance. There was also a dense poison lingering in the surroundings, causing this place to be filled with danger.Even he had to be very careful when going out, and had to take the specific path he had left behind.However, Zhang San was still a little worried. He even spread out his threads in the cave. While being on guard, he would occasionally turn his head to look at the flesh and blood statue and sigh."Captain, you didn't really play yourself to death inside, right?""Why do you have to play with your life? Can't you play with the senior sisters and junior sisters of the sect…""That's Binding. Although it's not a real god, it's still a terrifying divine creature. Who in the entire merfolk race is older than him? I reckon other than Mire who no one knows if it is alive or not, there's nothing else.""Don't die. If you die, my investments over the years… it will be a huge loss."Zhang San let out a long sigh. He had been guarding here for almost four hours and was starting to feel that the captain was dead.He shook his head helplessly. He decided to wait for another incense stick of time. If the captain still didn't come out, then he would have to move on.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  He was thinking about whether he should peel off a piece of this flesh as a memento before he left, when suddenly, the flesh and blood statue shook violently and roars that caused Zhang San's heart to tremble rang out.Zhang San's expression changed and he immediately took a few steps back. The surrounding threads quickly retracted and enveloped the statue.The crack on the flesh rapidly contracted and expanded. One moment, they were larger, and the next moment, they were smaller. It was as though it was breathing. The roars coming from it became clearer as it opened and closed.It was as though some terrifying existence was approaching from the flesh tunnel. This scene shocked Zhang San and he retreated again until he reached the exit. He was prepared to escape immediately if the situation didn't look good…Not long later, under Zhang San's nervous gaze, a hand covered in blood suddenly stretched out from the slit of the flesh. There were only three fingers left on the hand and only some traces of flesh were left on them, revealing the bones clearly.The hand grabbed at the flesh outside. It borrowed the force to support itself and gained the strength to continue crawling out. Very soon, half of the captain's body crawled out from the gap in the flesh.His hair was gone and his head was covered in blood. His face was also corroded in many parts and the parts that were alright were badly mangled.As for the densely-packed wounds on his body, they were even more shocking. The deepest ones looked like they were about to penetrate his body.However, his right hand was tightly grabbing onto a piece of squirming golden flesh. The bloody flesh carried terrifying fluctuations of divinity. It was… the flesh and blood of Binding!Its appearance immediately distorted the surroundings, as though countless mournful roars echoed out, causing Zhang San's mind to buzz and blood to flow from his seven orifices. His body seemed to collapse."Give me a hand!"The captain seemed to have used all his strength to crawl. At this moment, his expression was filled with anxiety as he quickly spoke to Zhang San.Zhang San barely regained his senses. With a wave of his hand, the surrounding threads wrapped around the captain's body. With a tug, this half of the captain's body fell from the crack.His lower body was gone.Only a bloody mess of his upper body was left."Quickly attack with me and shatter this flesh gate. Something is chasing after me!!" After coming out, the captain immediately shouted. He performed a series of hand seals and pointed at the flesh gate behind him.Zhang San knew that he was in danger and gritted his teeth as he attacked. Immediately, intense fluctuations of spells spread in the surroundings. The strength of the two gathered and blasted the meat gate, causing it to instantly collapse. As it shattered into pieces, a faint roar of anger could be heard coming from it.Just a trace of it caused Zhang San's entire body to tremble violently and he spat out several mouthfuls of blood. As his body retreated, cracking sounds rang out. At least 40 protective jade slips collapsed before they could neutralize the force, but it still heavily injured him.He took out medicinal pills with a lot of difficulty and swallowed them before he regained a hint of color on his face.The captain also spat out a mouthful of blood and his body was swept to the side. However, his right hand was still tightly gripping the flesh of Binding. His expression revealed a hint of excitement as he laughed loudly. "Who can compare to me? Ever since I knew that we were going to attack Merfolk Island, I started planning. I finally obtained the flesh of this divine creature. I'm rich! I'm completely rich this time!" The captain was extremely excited. His laughter affected his injuries and he gritted his teeth in pain. He hurriedly stored the flesh."Is it worth it? Half of your body is gone." Zhang San smiled bitterly at his captain."It's worth it!! It's only half a body. I've specially cultivated the secret art of broken limb regeneration. Coupled with some of the sect's great medicine, it will only take a few months for it to regrow. Moreover, I have this flesh of Binding. After fusing it into my body and refining the divinity, my recovery will be faster."The captain looked around excitedly."Where's my vice-captain?""How is this the time it takes for an incense stick to burn? It's been almost four hours. After Junior Brother Xu guarded the temple for two incense sticks of time and saw that you hadn't returned, he left in low spirit because he had his own arrangements. Before he left, he left me a lot of poison powder," Zhang San said as he ate the medicinal pills."It's fine. I didn't expect it to take so long either. I almost couldn't make it back." As the captain spoke, he took out an apple and ate it. Just as he was about to continue speaking…The ground suddenly rumbled.The entire Binding Island shook intensely at this instant, as though the earth was moving and the mountains were shaking. All the buildings in sight instantly collapsed. Wisps of black gas surged out of the collapsed buildings, the seaweed, and the sea anemone.A large amount of black gas rose from all the things in the underwater world. This black gas rapidly gathered and transformed into black fog that spread in all directions, as if it wanted to fill the entire underwater world.It contained dense anomalous substances that could corrode everything. At the same time, it seemed to contain strange things, causing all the corpses that had died in the underwater world to move, as though they had been revived.Moreover, as the black gas continued to rise, the range of the black fog also grew larger and larger. The expressions of all the Seven Blood Eyes disciples in the underwater world to change. All of them hurried toward the exit.The trembling of the ground was like an earth dragon flipping over, causing the captain's broken body to be jolted up. He almost lost the apple in his mouth. His expression changed and he quickly climbed onto Zhang San's back."This is the trump card of the merfolk race to bring mutual destruction. I came out late. Hurry, we have to get out of here quickly."Zhang San's expression changed. As the surrounding fog surged, he quickly ran in the direction of the exit.At the same time, in another direction of the temple cluster, Xu Qing, who had recovered a little with the help of the purple crystal, opened his eyes. He could sense the rumbling of the ground and also saw the black fog rolling over in the distance. His eyes narrowed.Without any hesitation, Xu Qing stood up with difficulty and put away the damaged magic boat. He gritted his teeth and sped forward. Not long after he left, the black fog in the surroundings enveloped the place. While it filled the place where he had recuperated earlier, it also invaded the dilapidated temple.In the fog, on the blank wall of the dilapidated temple, the mural was constantly flickering, as though it wanted to reform but in the end, it still failed.Only the carving of the merfolk king in the mural slowly weathered and dissipated.While all the Seven Blood Eyes cultivators at the underwater world sprinting toward the exit, the same thing was also happening in the outside world.Not only did the black fog appear on Binding Island, but Image, Hidden, and Mire Islands also erupted at the same time with this fog that seemed to be able to devour everything.From afar, a large amount of black fog rose from the four islands and spread in all directions. It was as though this was the last resort of the merfolk race.In the sky, Old Master Seventh, who was on the great wing, lowered his head and looked at the merfolk islands enveloped by the array formation. Although there was an array formation blocking his vision, he could still sense the changes inside.However, not only did this change not cause his expression to turn solemn, but he also smiled at the merfolk ancestor at the side."Not bad, finally something decent. I was thinking that this trial was too simple for those wolf cubs.""How is this a trial? This is clearly giving away resources. Fortunately, you added some difficulty."

Chapter 197 Reunion Of The Three
In the underwater world of Binding Island, Xu Qing moved with intense pain assaulting his entire body. The wounds on his legs, arms, and stomach that were slightly healed were torn apart again. More blood flowed out, dyeing his body and tattered robe red again.Although his body was protected by spirit energy, so the seawater wasn't able to touch his wound, the pain still grew more intense as he moved.This time around, Xu Qing's injuries were too serious. Even the purple crystal couldn't heal him quickly.At that moment, the fog in the surroundings was engulfing everything. Xu Qing could ignore the anomalous substances contained in it, but he could sense dense corpse poison in the fog.In his current state, encountering corpse poison would cause the purple crystal to divert a portion of its recovery power to cleanse it. It wouldn't be beneficial to his recovery.In addition, he also saw some corpses in the fog crawling up from the ground as though they had revived. They let out beast-like roars and ran amok in the fog.Once he was enveloped by the fog, he would definitely be in a life-and-death crisis."I have to leave this place as soon as possible." Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. He gritted his teeth and endured the intense pain as he sped forward.This intense activity caused his face to turn even paler. However, Xu Qing had no choice but to forcefully ignore the pain. As the fog continued to spread, he ran toward the exit and even used the flight talisman.However, his body was heavily injured and his spirit energy was almost exhausted. At the same time, he had to retain a certain amount of energy for dangerous situations. As such, he could only activate the flight talisman and couldn't rely on his cultivation to move faster.Just like that, time flowed by. After about fifteen minutes, Xu Qing finally rushed out of the range of the temples.Looking around, other than thin fog that covered everything, there was nothing else. Only the fog in the distance continued to devour and approach. Many temples and coral buildings were instantly devoured by it. Wherever it passed, everything would be dyed black.There were very few people here to begin with, and at this moment, there was no sign of them at all. Only the roars of the revived corpses in the fog could be heard.Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. He noticed that even the bottom of the sea was the same. There seemed to be an even thicker black fog rising from the bottom of the sea, preventing Xu Qing from escaping from below. He continued to speed forward.However, he was too far from the exit, so after moving forward for a while, as the fog in the surroundings filled the air, he was inevitably enveloped by it.Almost at the instant the fog enveloped him, Xu Qing's spirit energy defense fluctuated intensely and was rapidly corroding. At this moment, his vision was also severely obscured.Only the roars of corpses could be heard from all directions.Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. He lifted his right hand and the black iron stick slashed to the side. A savage low roar rang out at close range. It was a revived corpse.Different from the Sea Corpse Race, this corpse was a Seven Blood Eyes disciple when it was alive. At this moment, its entire body along with its eyes was black. Even though its neck had been torn open by the iron stick and its head had fallen off, its hands still grabbed fiercely at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's left hand formed a seal and the water curtain instantly spread out.The corpse was sent back by more than 100 feet.Xu Qing didn't continue fighting. The roars in the surroundings increased and a hint of determination appeared on his face. He formed a hand seal and pressed down on the ground. Immediately, countless water droplets formed beside him and instantly fused into a plesiosaur.After it appeared, the plesiosaur suddenly expanded to a thousand feet in size. After it enveloped Xu Qing, a low roar echoed as the plesiosaur rushed forward.Wherever it passed, any corpses that blocked it would be sent flying.This was Xu Qing's final trump card. Once the plesiosaur collapsed, it would be even more troublesome for him to leave this place.Fortunately, the speed of the plesiosaur was very fast and its huge body possessed impact force. Although it was constantly corroding and shrinking, the spirit energy Xu Qing stored in the plesiosaur was abundant. This allowed the plesiosaur to carry Xu Qing through the fog at high speed, slowly getting closer and closer to the exit.On the way, he also encountered some Seven Blood Eyes disciples. All of them were running with all their might, ignoring each other.However, just as Xu Qing was about to reach the area where the exit was located, because too many cultivators had died here, he heard countless roars coming from there.Many of the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples were stopped by the zombie tide. Xu Qing's expression was gloomy as he performed a series of hand seals with both hands and grabbed out.Immediately, his plesiosaur shrunk as though it was withering. The spirit energy contained in it rapidly surged into Xu Qing's body, allowing the dried up spirit energy in his body to be replenished.The plesiosaur started dissipating.However, at this moment, Xu Qing couldn't care less. As the plesiosaur's figure disappeared, more than half of the spirit energy in Xu Qing's body recovered. Although his physical injuries were still serious, his overall combat strength recovered a little.As he performed a series of hand seals, water droplets appeared and spun around him. He rushed out and leaped over the zombie tide. When he encountered obstructions, some of the water droplets outside his body would spread out, enveloping and shaking off the other party.Just like that, Xu Qing flew all the way. Everywhere he passed, the corpses would be enveloped by his water droplets, turning into balls of water that couldn't disturb him. Some time later, Xu Qing finally saw the exit.Just as he was about to cross the exit, Xu Qing suddenly saw a figure running over from another direction.As the figure ran, he also threw out mechanisms that would explode upon contact in the surroundings. Amidst the rumbling sounds of explosions, a familiar voice rang out from the fellow on his back."Zhang San, you can do it. That's right, throw them and blow them up. Aiyo, you threw them in the wrong direction. You should have thrown them over there."It was Zhang San who was running and the captain who spoke.Zhang San was panting as he ran with all his might. As for the captain on his back, he didn't seem to care about the environment here and kept commenting."Shut up!" Zhang San was furious."Eh, Zhang San, why are you talking to your original captain like this!" The captain was dissatisfied and took out an apple to take a bite."If you speak again, I'll throw you down and run by myself." "Big Brother San, you can do it!"Xu Qing's expression was a little strange. He glanced at Zhang San, who was rapidly approaching, and the captain, who had lost his lower body. He once again realized the captain's madness.Zhang San also saw Xu Qing. His eyes instantly lit up and he quickly threw out a thread that shuttled over, directly wrapping around Xu Qing's body. He borrowed the momentum to leap over rapidly."Ah, Deputy Captain Xu, what major thing did you do to make yourself so weak like this? Could it be that you went to the merfolk princess' bedroom and were squeezed dry?"The captain also saw Xu Qing. When he noticed that Xu Qing was covered in injuries and his tattered Daoist robe, his eyes lit up."Can it be recovered?" Xu Qing didn't answer. Instead, he glanced at the captain's body and calmly asked."No problem. I'll be alive and kicking after I get back," the captain said proudly."Mm, then I'll send you a <anno data-annotation-id="3a06342c-1bbd-4b55-bcfc-1e4783c9c743">feather</anno> later," Xu Qing said calmly."Feather, why would you send me a feather?" The captain was stunned."What are you still chatting about? Hurry up and leave." Zhang San was anxious. He felt that Xu Qing and the captain were both crazy. This place had become so dangerous, but the two of them were actually chatting.Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the captain's body and left in a flash. Zhang San hurriedly threw out the threads to coil around him and borrow the momentum to speed away. Just like that, they neared the exit. They immediately entered it and disappeared.Not long later, the surrounding black fog drowned this place. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The entire underwater world was completely enveloped by fog, but the fog did not stop. It continued to rise through the ground, the tunnels, and all the other locations.Xu Qing moved extremely fast in the passage between the island and the underwater world. The poison here had mostly dissipated by now. Even Xu Qing did not know if it had dispersed naturally or if it had spread to somewhere else.In just about eight minutes, his body broke through the surface of the water. The moment he leaped up, the flight talisman on his body activated with all its might and he transformed into a stream of light that headed straight up.Zhang San was the same. He took out his flight talisman and followed closely behind. Only the captain's voice was still filled with surprise as it continued to ring out."Xu Qing, what does giving a feather mean?"Xu Qing didn't reply."Deputy Captain Xu, you still owe me 8,000 spirit stones. What do feathers mean?"Xu Qing didn't even glance back. He directly rushed out of the tunnel. After stepping into the outside world, he felt a violent wind blowing at his face. He immediately looked around and his expression suddenly changed.Zhang San was the same. After he rushed out, his expression changed as he noticed his surroundings.The outside world was in chaos and violent wind blew everywhere.Streams of black smoke flowed up against the current, connecting to the array formation in the sky like a hurricane. There were a total of eight of these streams, with two on each island.Countless strands of black gas on the ground transformed into threads that continuously fused into the eight hurricane-like fog, causing it to continue to expand. In fact, when Xu Qing and the other two looked over, the spiraling fog not far away from them began to undergo a drastic change.A fork appeared at the top. These forks quickly transformed into snake heads. There were a total of nine heads, and after they formed, they let out a deafening roar toward the ground.This roar was so powerful that even the ground started shaking.Its cultivation and combat strength rose rapidly. It seemed to have broken through the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation and instantly reached the Core Formation realm, and it was still rising.The pressure formed by this scene caused Xu Qing's heart to tremble. He recognized this huge snake. It was the snake that he had seen on the mural, the snake that was coiled around the giant.The other seven rolling fog were the same. They all formed the appearance of large snakes one after another. As they roared, there was an intense transformation in the anomalous substances in the four islands.Regardless of whether it was the remaining merfolks or the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples, they were all invaded.Corpses opened their eyes and revived one after another.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="3a06342c-1bbd-4b55-bcfc-1e4783c9c743">It is referring to using a feather or quill as a passage for urine since the part is gone.</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 198 Senior Brother, My Name Is Ling'er
The four merfolk islands were in chaos. The anomalous substances were invading everything and the corpse poison was spreading everywhere.The remaining merfolk cultivators all had sinister expressions, and they were even more savage than before. They planned to perish together with the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples.However… very soon, the surviving merfolk cultivators discovered that something was amiss.Although the auras of the eight nine-headed snakes on the four islands were getting stronger and stronger and the amount of anomalous substances, corpse poison, and revived corpses on the ground was increasing, most of the Seventh Peak's disciples were already prepared.Some of them took out a large number of white pills and ate them like candy.Some even took out talismans that could isolate anomalous substances for a short period and used them without any heartache.There were also some who began to dig pits, as though they wanted to hide through this disaster and forcibly resist the anomalous substances and corpse poison. Most of the disciples who did this were people with extraordinary cultivation bases.Some Seven Blood Eyes disciples took out their magic boats and observed the outside world from inside the boat.Some even took out array discs and set up array formations. They were even calling out to other disciples to enter at a certain fee.The most exaggerated thing was that on Image Island, someone actually used some unknown method to control dozens of corpses to circle around them and made them inhale the anomalous substances and corpse poison in the surroundings. The disciple was relaxed and even let other disciples enter the circle after taking some fee.All kinds of methods were being displayed…There were even some Seven Blood Eyes disciples who directly entered the corpse tide and looted the leather pouches on the corpses. This even led to some of them luring the corpses and ambushing them.It looked like they didn't care about the eight nine-headed snakes at all. Or rather, even with these eight terrifying nine-headed snakes, it couldn't stop them from wanting to get rich.They were clearly so scared of poverty that they had the aura of 'either kill me or don't stop me from obtaining resources'.This scene caused a deep sense of powerlessness to rise in the hearts of the merfolk cultivators. However, they soon understood why. In the sky, Old Master Seventh, who was standing on great wing, had been watching the show and feeling happy that the trial had become somewhat difficult.However, when he saw the eight nine-headed snakes, his eyes lit up. He suddenly raised his hand and pressed down fiercely. Immediately, three of the eight nine-headed snakes let out wails and their bodies collapsed. They transformed into black fog and rushed out of the array formation, quickly being collected by Old Master Seventh.After gathering them in his hand, he looked a little surprised."This is a good thing."The 13 Core Formation elders were also tempted. They made a move one after another, but their attacks were affected by the array formation.However, under their combined strength, wisps of black gas seeped out of the array formation and were collected by them.How could the hundred Foundation Building cultivators at the side sit back and do nothing? All of them used their own methods. Some even flew close to the edge of the array formation and crazily collected the black gas.Under their efforts, the remaining five large snakes in the array formation seemed to have developed dysplasia and their auras sharply decreased. One of them was directly sucked dry and dissipated with a wail.The remaining four also continued to fall from the Core Formation realm and soon reached the early-stage Foundation Building realm.It wasn't over. They were still weakening, but the speed was a little slower.When the merfolk ancestor saw this scene and the excitement on the faces of the surrounding Seven Blood Eyes cultivators, he felt complete despair."The dignified Seven Blood Eyes is such a large sect. Ever since Zheng Kaiyi became the Seventh Peak's Peak Lord, everything has changed…"When the Seven Blood Eyes disciples on the four merfolk islands saw this scene, some were tempted and rushed out. They joined forces with other disciples to kill the huge snakes.On Binding Island, Ding Xiaohai's clothes were tattered but his aura was imposing. He was the first to rush out and head straight for the large snake outside Fishbone City. Three other fellow disciples also rushed over from all directions and attacked together with him.However, those three's task was to gather the black gas and Ding Xiaohai's task was to fight.As the rumbling echoed, Xu Qing saw this scene and also saw the three people who attacked together with Ding Xiaohai. All of them were extraordinary. There was also a young girl in a gray Daoist robe among them who was very eye-catching.This young girl had a petite figure, but was bewitchingly charming. Her face was like a lotus, her brows were like willows, and her eyes that were even more charming than peach blossoms were extremely seductive. Her bright red lips that were slightly curled added further to her beauty.She was wearing a large Daoist robe, but when her body swayed, one could still see the fullness of her chest and the shape of her peach-like butt. In particular, her waist was extremely thin.Zhang San gulped, but the pressure from the huge snake caused his mind to tremble. He felt that with his strength, he would probably be swept away by a snake head. Even if he didn't die, he would be crippled.Xu Qing's gaze swept over without any fluctuations. His focus was on the nine-headed snake. In his mind, the snake overlapped with the snake in the mural. This surprised him but at the same time, he also felt an extremely strong sense of vigilance.He was worried that since this snake appeared, then the giant with two great worlds on his shoulder would appear as well.As for the captain, he no longer asked Xu Qing about the feather. His broken body was lying on Zhang San's back as he stared fixedly at the large snake, revealing an intense desire."This is a good thing. Such dense anomalous substances. This thing is a great weapon to trick people!""Now that it's suppressed by the array formation, it's more convenient for us to get it. If we can get it and sell it, we can make a fortune. The group of people on the mountain will fight to buy it. I didn't expect that this kid Ding Xiaohai, who usually looks serious, actually has ulterior motives. He knows that this is a good thing, so he is trying to snatch it?""No can do, I'll get this thing even if I have to bite it.""Zhang San, let's go!!"Zhang San's face twitched. He turned around and ran in the opposite direction. He didn't even turn his head, as though he wouldn't go over and court death no matter what. click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  "Zhang San, don't be a coward. Go, that's a valuable thing.""Why don't I put you down and you crawl over yourself?" Zhang San replied.The captain sighed and turned to look at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, go. That thing is really good stuff."Xu Qing ignored him. After obtaining the supreme treasure, he didn't want to take any risks. At this moment, the only thought in his mind was to endure until the end of the competition and leave this place quickly. He would immediately attempt Foundation Building when he returned.Seeing that Xu Qing wasn't going, the captain let out a long sigh and took out the bit apple that had started to darken. He looked at the large snake and took a bite. His face was filled with regret and heartache, as though he felt that others were snatching his items.At that moment, the charming young girl in Ding Xiaohai's group seemed to have discovered something as she nimbly moved around the giant snake. She suddenly turned her head and looked at the location of Xu Qing and the other two.After she noticed Xu Qing, the young girl's eyes clearly lit up. She quickly nodded at Xu Qing as though she was greeting him.Seeing that Xu Qing wasn't paying attention to her, the flight talisman on the young girl's body flickered. She actually abandoned the large snake and flew straight toward Xu Qing.As the whistling sound rang out, Xu Qing immediately lifted his head warily. The black iron stick appeared in his right hand as he stared at the young girl who was rapidly approaching. At the same time, he was ready to release poison powder.They had only met by chance and didn't know each other. The other party was rushing over like this, so Xu Qing had no choice but to be vigilant.Sensing that Xu Qing was about to release poison, Zhang San was so frightened that he hurriedly distanced himself and looked at the incoming person.The captain narrowed his eyes with a spurious smile."Hello, Senior Brother." As though she didn't notice Xu Qing's vigilance, the young girl ran over happily. She lifted her right hand and took out a ball of black fog.This item was none other than the flesh of the large snake. The young girl had placed it in a transparent bottle."Senior Brother, I'm Ling'er from the Intelligence Department. I want to ask you a question. If you answer me, I'll give you this piece of meat, okay?"The young girl's voice was as pleasant as a lark. However, she didn't seem to understand the meaning of observing other party's expressions. Before Xu Qing could speak, she immediately asked her question."Senior Brother, do you like snakes or do you like to eat snake gallbladders?"The young girl had a look of anticipation on her face, as though this question had been buried in her heart for a very, very long time, and she finally found an opportunity to ask. After she finished speaking, she looked straight at Xu Qing and ignored the captain and Zhang San.Zhang San looked at the petite but ravishing young girl in front of him and then at Xu Qing. He let out a long sigh inwardly.Xu Qing frowned and instinctively took a few steps back. While being vigilant, he also found the other party's question very strange. He slowly spoke."Snake gallbladder is too bitter.""That means you like snakes!"The young girl's eyes became even brighter. She didn't know how to hide her emotions, so joy was completely exposed on her face. She even spun around excitedly.After that, she threw the small bottle to Xu Qing and ran away toward the large snake in satisfaction.The captain on Zhang San's back glanced at the small bottle in Xu Qing's hand and suddenly shouted at the young girl who was running away."Junior Sister Ling'er, you can also ask me a question. Three is fine too. How about ten!"Ling'er turned her head and stuck out her tongue at the captain before quickly running away.The captain had an angry expression as he patted Zhang San's head. His voice was filled with dissatisfaction."Why? I'm not bad-looking either. Ten questions to me aren't worth more than one question to Xu Qing?""What do you think? Your lower body is gone. What right do you have?" Zhang San muttered.The captain was stunned for a moment and wanted to refute. However, when he saw that Zhang San seemed to want to let go and throw him down, he endured it.Just like that, time slowly passed. The remaining four large snakes became weaker and weaker as the cultivators of the Seventh Peak outside the array formation continued to collect them.In addition, the disciples of the Seventh Peak had guessed the value and swarmed over like wolf cubs. Gradually, the large snakes collapsed one after another.This competition also ended with the last snake shattering into pieces.At this moment, the array formation in the sky was opened. It was early in the morning outside. The long-lost sunlight shone down, landing on the merfolk islands that were riddled with holes and on the disciples with bulging pockets.Although more than half of the disciples had died, the eyes of the remaining ones shone brightly.Xu Qing was among them. He lifted his head and looked at the many cultivators in the sky. Finally, his gaze landed on the figure standing above the great wing's head."You guys have performed well. There should be more Foundation Building cultivators in my Seventh Peak now. I congratulate you in advance."The aged voice revealed satisfaction.

Chapter 199 Silly Girl
The Seventh Peak's competition on the merfolk island ended with Old Master Seventh's voice.This time, the merfolk race didn't have the chance or qualifications to choose to become allies.Right now, more than half of the merfolk race had died and their experts were enslaved and suppressed. The wealth on the four islands had also been plundered. However, it was obvious that a race would have more treasures and foundations hidden in the dark.However, these were things that the Qi Condensation piedmont disciples could not touch.Although there was the suppression of the array formation, there would still be many secret chambers and storage places that couldn't be sensed by Qi Condensation cultivators. One could imagine that the Seventh Peak's Foundation Building cultivators would have a banquet next."This time, the Seven Blood Eyes won a huge victory. They killed countless birds with one arrow." click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  The captain, who was lying on Zhang San's back, laughed. His laughter seemed to affect his injuries, he hurriedly took out the apple he hadn't finished eating earlier and took a bite. His expression became satisfied, as though this could make him feel less pain."How many?" Zhang San asked curiously."Using the merfolk race's territory as the venue for the Grand Competition is only an arrangement on the surface. The first wave of plundering by the piedmont disciples is followed by the second wave of plundering by Foundation Building cultivators, then the third wave of plundering by Core Formation cultivators. Finally, the fourth wave of plundering will be done by the old geezers.""Like this, the merfolk race's many years of heritage can't be hidden at all. Everything will be moved away. This is the first bird.""As for the hidden arrangement, we used the merfolk race as bait to lure the Sea Corpse Race over. This allowed the ancestor, who had just broken through and was in a hungry state, to have a full meal. This is the second bird.""In addition, this attack can intimidate the surrounding nonhuman races in all directions and increase the prestige of the Seven Blood Eyes. This is the third bird. Just brilliant.""As for the fourth bird, the merfolk race is located in a strategic location between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race. After occupying this place, we can launch the leapfrogging battle tactic against the Sea Corpse Race. I estimate that the war will begin soon."The captain was analyzing at the side and Xu Qing listened. He lacked a lot of key information about this, so he didn't understand much previously. After hearing the captain's explanation, he instantly understood. However, he was still a little puzzled and asked."Why is ancestor hungry after breaking through?""You don't want to know." The captain cast a meaningful glance at Xu Qing.Old Master Seventh, who was in the sky, had a satisfied expression. His gaze swept across the ground and he waved his hand. Immediately, the great wing under him roared at the sky and spat out a purple stream of light.When this stream of light landed, it spread out, forming a sea of light. After enveloping the four islands, the teleportation was activated.Xu Qing heaved a sigh of relief inwardly. He and everyone else disappeared without a trace at this instant, teleported back to the Seven Blood Eyes' mountain gate.After they left, the eyes of the Foundation Building cultivators in the sky lit up.Old Master Seventh looked at them and smiled."Go!"As soon as he finished speaking, a hundred Foundation Building cultivators transformed into over a hundred streams of light that headed straight for the four islands. These Foundation Building cultivators naturally would not come here if there were no benefits to be had.Previously, because the competition was being held and the participants were all Qi Condensation cultivators, they didn't mind. But now that the disciples were gone, their eyes lit up and they quickly scattered across the four islands to plunder.At the same time, on the central altar of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, a sea of purple light suddenly appeared, forming a huge ring in the air. The figures of the Seventh Peak's disciples appeared and headed straight for the ground.Xu Qing noticed that the number of people who returned was less than 2,000, and every one of them emitted a more intense baleful aura."When we went, we were over 4,000, but now, more than half are gone."When he was teleported, Xu Qing was separated from Zhang San and the captain. He swept his gaze across the surroundings and gained a better understanding of the cruelty of the Seven Blood Eyes Competition.However, he also noticed that other than the baleful aura, everyone who returned couldn't hide their excitement. Clearly, their harvest this time was astonishing. In fact, Xu Qing even saw the little fatty in the crowd.The island the other party had gone to during the competition was different from Xu Qing. At this moment, he was standing there beaming with joy. There were seven to eight storage bags on his waist and he was swollen with arrogance.After sensing Xu Qing's gaze, he excitedly ran all the way to Xu Qing's side."How was it? Your harvest was good, right? I also gained a lot this time."Xu Qing nodded. However, his entire body was still aching. Waves of weakness uncontrollably spread in his entire body, causing him to be a little fatigued.Just as the little fatty was about to continue speaking, a figure walked out of the sea of light in the sky. As soon as this figure appeared, vast cultivation fluctuations instantly suppressed the surroundings, causing the disciples to fall silent and look up.Xu Qing also lifted his head and stared. He recognized the other party, he was Zhao Zhongheng's grandfather, the Third Elder of the Seventh Peak."There are some follow-up matters in the merfolk race's territory. The peak lord still has to wait for the ancestor to return. As such, this old man will announce the results of this competition.""The killing points you have are recorded in your respective identity tokens. As for your harvest, you can rest assured that the tokens won't record these and don't have this function. No matter how much you gain, it's your own business. It's the same in the past competitions. The sect doesn't care.""This old man will only announce the first place.""Ding Xiaohai, step forward!"As the Third Elder spoke, Ding Xiaohai, whose Daoist robe was in tatters and was clearly heavily injured, immediately lifted his head and barely relied on the flight talisman to rise into the air."Ding Xiaohai, who obtained first place in this competition, is bestowed the status of a core disciple. He will wear a light purple robe and have the right to stay on the mountain. However, the cave abode is expensive. You have to buy it yourself!"The Third Elder calmly spoke, his voice echoing in all directions like thunder.Ding Xiaohai was excited. He cupped his fists and bowed deeply to the sky."Many thanks to the sect!"The Third Elder lowered his head and looked at Ding Xiaohai, who had always been known as the number one person at the foot of the mountain, with admiration in his eyes.He admired the disciples who fought for the glory of the sect, but admiration was admiration. He didn't have any thoughts of showing kindness to the other party. Moreover, the other party was thanking the sect, not him.From the perspective of the sect, such a disciple was very good. In order to obtain first place, he was persistent and did his best to kill the enemies.However, from a personal perspective, he felt that the other party's personality was stubborn and cared too much about his reputation. For this, he sacrificed this rare opportunity to reap benefits. It was very difficult for such a person to survive in this chaotic world.Since Ding Xiaohai was not going to live long, it would be meaningless to show kindness. Moreover, in this chaotic world, it was important to hide one's capabilities.Most of the people who showed too much capability ended up in a very miserable state. On this point, he admired that kid named Xu Qing much more. The kid had silently reached the realm where he was about to break through.As Ding Xiaohai's excited voice rang out, the surrounding disciples with bulging pockets were all very supportive and congratulated him.​ "Congratulations, Senior Brother Ding!""Congratulations, Senior Brother Ding!!" In the crowd, Xu Qing heard the captain's voice. The little fatty at the side also shouted congratulations. After that, he lowered his head and sighed with emotion at Xu Qing."Senior Brother Ding is a good person. He only cares about killing enemies and never snatches resources from us. If only all the disciples were like Senior Brother Ding."Xu Qing calmly looked at Ding Xiaohai in the sky.In this world, everyone had their own way of living. Some emphasized benefits, while others prioritized reputation. There was no right or wrong in this. Ding Xiaohai was already on the verge of breaking through and he could change into the purple robe as soon as he broke through.However, perhaps the identity of a core disciple was an obsession.Xu Qing didn't comment but he knew that he didn't care about these.The only thing attracting him to Seven Blood Eyes was benefits. He was very eager to become a Foundation Building cultivator. On one hand, he could survive better if he became stronger. On the other hand, he was very envious of the monthly distribution of benefits after reaching the Foundation Building realm.In addition, he didn't like to be in the limelight. Unless the benefits of doing so were astonishing, it would be safer to hide in the darkness.After he rewarded Ding Xiaohai, the third elder stepped into the sea of light again and teleported away. The disciples on the altar dispersed one after another and Xu Qing also left.Even though he was exhausted now, Xu Qing didn't dare to stay in the Seven Blood Eyes for too long. His gains this time were too great.It was so huge that once it was exposed, the whole Seven Blood Eyes would be shocked.After all… that was a life lantern that could make even the major sects of the Wanggu Continent envious.Xu Qing immediately headed to the various shops at the port and sold all his scattered items in exchange for spirit stones.He then replenished some talismans and headed to the shop that sold array formations. He used the large number of contribution points he obtained from killing in the competition to purchase five sets of protective array formation at an expensive price.The price of this array formation was astonishing, but the effects were also extremely strong. The array formation could protect the disciple from the attacks of Foundation Building cultivators, who weren't in the Mystic Brilliance Form, for a long time.Moreover, as long as there were enough spirit stones, its effect could be maintained and it even had some self-repairing function.If the five sets were used together, the effect would be even better.These five sets of array formation consumed 90% of the contribution points Xu Qing had obtained from killing in the competition. However, he knew that it was worth it. After that, he went to the medicinal shop and bought a large number of medicinal pills and poisonous grass.After doing all this, Xu Qing felt that he was almost done with his preparations. Right now, he only needed to repair the magic boat."Let's see how long it will take for the magic boat to be repaired. If it's within a day, I'll wait. If it's longer… I can't wait anymore." Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He wanted to reach the Foundation Building realm as soon as possible.With the life lantern in hand, one day delay in reaching the Foundation Building realm would mean one more day of nervousness and uneasiness.Moreover, he knew that he couldn't reach Foundation Building in the sect because he wasn't sure if the integration of the life lantern during Foundation Building would cause fluctuations that would be sensed by outsiders.This was a serious matter and he couldn't gamble.This was especially so when he witnessed the unlucky merfolk cultivator encountering an accident when he was trying to reach the Foundation Building realm in Binding Island. Such an accident was almost impossible in the Seven Blood Eyes.However, Xu Qing had to be wary.With the protection of the Spirit Breath Lantern, Xu Qing felt that he already had the qualifications to reach the Foundation Building realm alone outside. He sped up and headed straight for the Transportation Department to find Zhang San.The sky was gradually turning dark. While Xu Qing was cautiously moving toward the Transportation Department, in an inn on Panquan Road, the old man was wiping some wounds on the snake's scales with a pained expression."You actually went to buy a Transformation Pill and ate it behind my back. Can you eat that thing casually? It's not time for you to transform yet. You've only transformed for a few days after eating it. If you eat too much, your cultivation will be crippled for the rest of your life!!""Moreover, you silly snake, you actually ate the transformation pills to participate in the Seventh Peak's competition. Don't you know how dangerous that competition is?"The old man's heart ached immensely. After he finished applying the medicine, he rebuked angrily."Gurgle, gurgle." The large snake seemed to be very happy. It twisted its body and stuck its head over, speaking proudly to the old man."I'm not lying to you. That little thief Xu has his eyes on your gallbladder, huh? You didn't go to the competition to look for him, right?!" The old man glared."Gurgle, gurgle!" The large snake let out a few unconvinced cries.The old man looked at the large snake in front of him and let out a long sigh. He then stroked the large snake's head. Like an old father talking to his daughter, he spoke earnestly."Silly girl, he said that snake gallbladder is bitter. Doesn't this mean that he has eaten snake gallbladder before? Moreover, he must have eaten more than one…"The large snake was stunned and stood there in a daze. Gradually, its eyes turned red, looking like it was about to cry.

Chapter 200 Going Out For Foundation Building! (1)
In the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, the moonlight spread out on the ground like sand.Xu Qing stepped on the moonlight and continued forward.Although his cultivation had reached the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, his previous injuries were still there. Xu Qing was as vigilant as when he had just arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes.Moreover, he had the life lantern on him, so he was extremely vigilant. His right hand seemed to sway naturally as he moved but in reality, whenever there was any movement, his current posture would allow him to instantly take out the black iron stick.This was the experience Xu Qing had gained from living in the Seven Blood Eyes. Being a needle in cotton was the way to survive. Unless there was a goal, he couldn't reveal his edge casually.In addition, the experience in the Seven Blood Eyes also taught Xu Qing a way to relax his body the more vigilant he was. He had discovered that just like back then in the slums and the scavenger campsite, when his body was tense, it seemed like he could instantly attack but in reality, the movements would be a little slow.The true method was for his body to relax and his mind to be filled with vigilance. In this way, outsiders wouldn't be able to see anything and he only needed a thought to move his body instantly.These were all techniques he had learned and had unknowingly changed many of his behaviors. It was just that Xu Qing was still too young. He still couldn't compare to his captain who could perfectly hide his expressions.However, Xu Qing wouldn't forcefully imitate it. Everything was done according to his instincts. As he sped forward, he was getting closer and closer to Zhang San's transportation department. click ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ for visiting. ​  Just as he passed by a place, Xu Qing suddenly stopped in his tracks and abruptly turned his head to look behind him. Coldness flashed in his eyes.Under his gaze, a small and skinny figure slowly walked out from a distant corner. It was none other than the mute youth.The Seven Blood Eyes' Daoist robe was still wide on his body. The dog skin coat inside still made him look very bloated. However, unlike before, there was an additional badge on his Daoist robe. This was the symbol of an official member of the Homicide Department.He appeared in the distance and quickly glanced at Xu Qing. After that, he crouched. His posture wasn't that of attacking but more like he was following and protecting.Xu Qing stared at the mute youth and looked at the badge on his Daoist robe. Xu Qing had read the file on this mute before and knew that the other party had been only a collaborative member when he first entered the Homicide Department. Now, he had become an official. He slowly spoke."I don't like to be followed."The mute youth fell silent before retreating and disappearing into the night again.Only then did Xu Qing retract his gaze. He didn't care if the other party had good intentions or ill intentions. Right now, he wasn't in the mood to judge. However, if the other party still followed him after he had clearly told him, he would kill him.Xu Qing continued to move.Not long later, Xu Qing arrived at the Transportation Department. From afar, he saw Zhang San taking inventory. Clearly, after he returned from the competition, Zhang San was worried his treasures would be stolen.Zhang San also saw Xu Qing. After waving at Xu Qing as a greeting, he finished counting and took out the tobacco pipe in satisfaction."Junior Brother Xu Qing, why are you here instead of resting?"Xu Qing didn't ask Zhang San why he didn't put the items into his storage bag and took out his magic boat.As the magic boat landed on the ground loudly, the ground trembled and some fragmented parts hanging on the boat dropped."To repair the magic boat."Xu Qing calmly spoke.Zhang San's eyes almost popped out. He even forgot to smoke the pipe in his hand as he stared blankly at the familiar yet unfamiliar half of the magic boat."Didn't we meet during the competition? We guarded the captain in the temple and then returned together?" After a long time, Zhang San's expression was still a little stunned."Yes." Xu Qing looked at Zhang San in surprise."Since I wasn't hallucinating and you were indeed the one I encountered in the competition, tell me how your magic boat became like this. Heavens, this is my most outstanding work. I, I, I… Even a Foundation Building cultivator would find it difficult to destroy it to such an extent!!""How did you manage to destroy half of the magic boat? Are you using it as a shield?" Zhang San clutched his chest. At that moment, his heartache seemed to be even greater than Xu Qing's.During the competition, he remembered that Xu Qing had used the magic boat to attack the huge corpse. At that time, it was still intact. However, it was actually destroyed to such an extent now. This made him feel that it was unbelievable unless he did something crazy like the captain…At the thought of this, Zhang San's heart suddenly skipped a beat. He recalled how Xu Qing was in a weak state when he saw him again near the exit of the underwater world. He took a deep breath."You didn't really do a crazy thing like the captain, did you?"Xu Qing shook his head."Senior Brother Zhang San, how long will it take to repair it?"Zhang San looked at the magic boat and let out a long sigh."Alright, alright. Last time, you brought back a swift boat. Compared to that, it's still fine this time. There's at least half a magic boat left…""However, I won't be able to restore it in a short period. I'm going out with the captain tomorrow. He asked me to carry him somewhere to treat his injuries. He said that I can also build my foundation there.""If you're not in a hurry, I'll refine it for you after I advance to Foundation Building and come back. Its quality should be much better if I refine it at that time. Besides, the flesh that the Captain obtained can also be placed in the new ship as a temporary power source."
