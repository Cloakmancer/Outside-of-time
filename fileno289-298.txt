It was only late autumn in the Seven Blood Eyes, but it was already winter in Purple Earth.The wind and snow drifted down, covering this ancient city that had existed for tens of thousands of years.From afar, the dark red palaces and buildings seemed to be embedded in the boundless snow.The entire land was covered in layers of snow and there weren't many pedestrians on the streets. All of them were wearing thick clothes but they couldn't sweep away the snowflakes that continued to fall, causing everyone to get white hair.The falling snow and the numb expressions of the pedestrians fused into the environment, gradually creating an atmosphere of decline and oppression.The tiled roofs of all the buildings in the city were like lonely islands in a sea of snow.This place was Purple Earth.This place was also the former imperial capital of the Nanhuang Continent.Ten thousand years ago, there was a kingdom in the Nanhuang Continent called the Purple Green Kingdom. It had once unified the Nanhuang Continent and used the Flame Phoenix as its symbol. However, even it was unable to survive in this cruel chaotic world.It collapsed due to internal strife and was buried in history.As for the royal family back then and the wealth of their inheritance, they were divided up by those rebelling factions back then. It was the same for their bloodlines.After the rebels divided up everything, they became orthodox. They formed eight large families and occupied Purple Earth. They also worshiped the totem of the Flame Phoenix as their god.The size of the entire Purple Earth imperial city was about the size of three Seven Blood Eyes' main city and was divided into eight areas.They were the territories of the eight great families.In each area, there was a building similar to a palace. They were the ancestral lands of these eight families.Some of the family's imperial palaces were surrounded by jade-green water filled with duckweed. There were lifelike dragons and phoenixes carved on the eaves of the palace.Some imperial palaces had golden glazed tiles that shone dazzlingly under the winter sun. From afar, the double-eaved palace looked dazzling.Compared to the Seven Blood Eyes, it was a completely different style.Purple Earth was more like a rigid and stubborn old man who wore luxurious clothes. Everything was about rules, bloodline, and family traditions.This was their way of survival in this chaotic world. It was completely different from the Seven Blood Eyes that only prioritized benefits, and it was not easy to tell which was better.As a branch of the Seven Sects Alliance, the Seven Blood Eyes were inferior to Purple Earth at the start. As time passed, they gradually reached the same level.Now, with Ancestor Xue Lianzi's breakthrough, they surpassed Purple Earth in one go and even had the courage to start a war with the nonhuman races.However, Purple Earth was different.They liked to close themselves off and didn't like others disturbing them. In fact, while they revered the fragmented face in the sky, they also looked down on all the forces in the outside world. They didn't even fancy the Wanggu Continent.They felt that their bloodline was the most noble and never thought that they were frogs at the bottom of a well. 𝔗𝔥𝔦𝔰 𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔭𝔱𝔢𝔯 𝔲𝔭𝔩𝔬𝔞𝔡 𝔣𝔦𝔯𝔰𝔱 𝔞𝔱 𝔫𝔬𝔳𝔢𝔩-𝔟𝔦𝔫.𝔠𝔬𝔪 Therefore, if the people who lived here didn't have the bloodline that had been passed down, they wouldn't have a future. Naturally, they wouldn't have any energy and vitality. Servility slowly seeped into their souls and continued on for generations.Grandmaster Bai was one of the few ambitious people in Purple Earth in the past countless years.He was also the first person to break the traditional concept of the family and seek to develop together with the human alliance in the outside world.His thoughts contradicted Purple Earth's, and he paid a price for it, becoming a mortal.However, he didn't give up. With his incomparable talent in the Dao of plants and vegetation, he forcibly walked another path in a limited period of time.Moreover, he developed a large number of pill formulas. In terms of the Dao of plants and vegetation, he, who was a mortal, had surpassed cultivators.He could even be considered the number one alchemist in the Nanhuang Continent.Even the Nascent Soul Peak Lord of the Second Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes admired Grandmaster Bai very much. Even someone like Old Master Seventh called him Grandmaster.All of this showed that Grandmaster Bai's attainments in alchemy had already reached the peak.However, even so, he was still locked up by layers of rules in Purple Earth. There were many things he was powerless to do. Everything was because of his bloodline.Grandmaster Bai wasn't a direct descendant of the Bai family. He came from a collateral branch.At that moment, the blizzard grew even heavier.As the snowflakes drifted, more than ten people stood silently in the public cemetery in the city area where the Bai family was located. In front of them was a crystal coffin. Grandmaster Bai's corpse lay inside and the wound between his brows had already been covered.Although his body was enhanced by magic power and sealed within a crystal coffin, upon closer inspection, one could still see that Grandmaster Bai's corpse was rotting and turning black.This was a sign of being poisoned. This poison was very domineering and could speed up rotting.Hence, the corpse couldn't be kept for too long and had to be buried soon.The thinness of his bloodline caused Grandmaster Bai to not have the qualifications to enter the family's imperial mausoleum after his death. Grandmaster Bai also disdained this when he was alive. Many years ago, he had given the instructions to bury him in the public mausoleum after his death.Most of the people present were standing silently, including Bai Yundong.The people who were present were either Grandmaster Bai's juniors or people who were close to him. There weren't many of them, or maybe, one did not need to have many friends in their life. Three to five close friends were enough.As the coffin was buried, the oppressive atmosphere around everyone in front of the grave became even more solemn. It was only when a young girl couldn't control herself and cried that the oppression was broken.The one crying was Ting Yu.Two years had passed and she had already grown up. She was in her prime time and it should have been as carefree as ever. However, with Grandmaster Bai's death, her sky collapsed.She knelt in front of the grave and tears flowed down her face.Beside her stood an 18 or 19-year-old youth. This youth had a tall and straight figure and an imposing appearance. His robe was extremely luxurious and the jade pendant on his waist emitted the light of a magic artifact.He was Chen Feiyuan.He was the eldest grandson of this generation of the Chen family. In reality, he was the one who pushed for the teleportation blockade after Grandmaster Bai's death.He clenched his fists tightly and his breathing was hurried. The killing intent in his eyes was extremely clear and intense.Amidst their sorrow and anger, they didn't notice that in an alley some distance away from this mausoleum, there was a middle-aged man looking at this place quietly.The middle-aged man wore a thick hemp robe and looked ordinary. His face was a little sallow but his eyes revealed endless sorrow. His body was trembling slightly at this moment. His right hand grabbed the wall at the side so hard that the bricks shattered.After a long time, the sky gradually darkened. As the sun gradually set and dusk was about to disperse, everyone in front of Grandmaster Bai's grave silently left.The last to leave were Tingyu, Chen Feiyuan, and Chen Feiyuan's followers.The middle-aged man silently walked forward. He didn't look at the people who had left and moved closer to this public cemetery. On the way, he passed by Chen Feiyuan and Tingyu.Chen Feiyuan supported Tingyu, who was still crying from extreme grief, and also noticed Xu Qing. However, in his sorrow, he didn't pay much attention. This cemetery was very large and many people came to mourn every day.This also made him even more indignant. His master was buried here, but he was helpless."Do you think he will come…" Tingyu wiped her tears and asked weakly."Him? Hmph, if he was coming, he would have arrived long ago. If he's not here yet, it just means he is an ingrate like the others!" Chen Feiyuan didn't need to think to know who Tingyu was talking about. He gritted his teeth and spoke.Tingyu fell silent.The middle-aged man silently walked past them until everyone behind him had left. He then arrived in front of Grandmaster Bai's grave and looked at the tombstone with reddened eyes."Teacher…" The middle-aged man mumbled. His voice was hoarse as he knelt down toward the tombstone. He was Xu Qing, who had teleported to Purple Earth!After teleporting to Purple Earth, Xu Qing immediately learned of Grandmaster Bai's burial and rushed over. However, he knew that his Daoist robe was too conspicuous and wasn't conducive to tracking down the murderer.Hence, he changed his appearance and arrived here.Looking at the tombstone, Xu Qing felt a piercing pain in his chest. This pain grew deeper and deeper and began to spread throughout his body.Up until now, he had only knelt before two tombstones. One was Captain Lei's and the other was Grandmaster Bai's."Teacher, I will find the murderer and the mastermind." Xu Qing mumbled bitterly. After kowtowing to the tombstone, he took out a wine gourd and placed it in front of the tomb."Captain Lei said that you like to drink, so this disciple will accompany you." As Xu Qing spoke, he picked up the wine gourd and took a sip. After that, he gently scattered it in front of the grave and placed it to the side."Teacher, I've already memorized the Grasswood Scripture you left behind. I'll read them for you.""The Dao of Plants and Vegetation is one of the myriad manifestations of nature. It can be compared to a Great Dao and penetrates through the nature of all things and principles of the heavens.""The first plant is goldturn grass, also known as the three-leaf pearl or the coldscatter grass. It is the white water sedge that belongs to the cyperaceae-class of plants and is a perennial herb. It grows in forests under the hillsides and in spacious wet areas. It can be found in Lingyou, the southern part of Nanhuang, and the two continents of Guangling.""The second plant is the rhino-fire flower, also known as the cloud dream silk. It's a perennial spiritual fire-type plant. Its effects consist of soothing the lungs and stopping coughs, mild detoxification, dispersion of bruises, and curing venomous snake bites or injuries from a fall."…"The 137th plant, soul fusion fog, also known as closed heavenly eyes. It's a high-level spirit herb born of fog. It can fuse a mark with the soul and is difficult to detect and remove. It's the main ingredient of the Daybreak Scattered Decay Pill."Xu Qing mumbled softly and talked of the medicinal herbs he had memorized from the Grasswood Scripture.In his daze, he seemed to have seen Grandmaster Bai's figure appear in front of him again. Grandmaster Bai was drinking and smiling at him. His eyes were dignified but he couldn't hide his relief."Night Corpse Leading Ox, also known as Poison Mountain Root Turtledove Chrysanthemum. It's the stem and root of the chrysanthemum plant, the fine-veined Turtledove Chrysanthemum. It's a wooden vine that grows in ravines of corpse mountain, cold streams, or jungles. Its taste is astringent and slightly warm when it enters the mouth. It has the feeling of rotting. It has the miraculous effect of dispelling pathogenic wind. However, it's excessively poisonous. It's a typical extreme Yin-Yang plant."A cold wind blew over and snowflakes fell one after another. Xu Qing's voice echoed in front of Grandmaster Bai's grave until night fell when his shadow transmitted a wisp of emotions.It was telling him that it had found the culprit!Xu Qing abruptly lifted his head and silently looked at Grandmaster Bai's tombstone. He heavily kowtowed three times. The moment he stood up, his entire body emitted astonishing killing intent and he disappeared into the night.Not long after he left, several figures arrived quickly from afar. At the front was Tingyu. Behind her were Chen Feiyuan and several of his followers."Tingyu, did you see wrongly? How is that possible? He's a famous person in the Seven Blood Eyes now. How can he still remember Teacher?""There's no mistake. I recognize his gaze. I thought about it properly when I got back. It must be him!"

Chapter 290 Using Bizarre Against Bizarre (1)
"Impossible. I don't believe that kid still remembers Teacher." As the voice rang out, Tingyu's figure rapidly approached in the darkness. When she arrived in front of Grandmaster Bai's grave and looked at the empty surroundings, she fell silent."I knew it. It's impossible for him to come." Although Chen Feiyuan said this, his eyes quickly checked his surroundings."He was here." Tingyu looked at Grandmaster Bai's grave and said softly.Chen Feiyuan was stunned. After that, he lowered his head and looked at the front of the grave. There was a faint fragrance of wine that was faintly discernible. Clearly, someone had paid their respects here after they left. "It might not be him. It might be someone else. Even if it's really him, so what…" After a moment of silence, Chen Feiyuan sighed.Tingyu bit her lower lip and wanted to say something but hesitated."Now that he's in the Seven Blood Eyes and is in the Sequence, he might seem to be in a glorious position but as long as he doesn't pay respects to Old Master Seventh as his master, he'll still be a duckweed in the end… Teacher's matter is very difficult for him to handle. Let's not fantasize. Perhaps you're wrong. An ingrate like him was never here.""We will take revenge ourselves!"Chen Feiyuan spoke in a low voice and pulled Tingyu, who had a bitter expression and was in a daze, away from the cemetery. After he sent Tingyu back to her residence, he turned and left. His expression became solemn.As he walked on the way to the Chen family, one of the few followers behind him, a youth who was about the same age as him, spoke in a low voice."Young Master, is the ingrate you mentioned earlier the Xu Qing whose reputation spread throughout the Nanhuang some time ago?"Almost at the instant the youth spoke, Chen Feiyuan suddenly turned around. He coldly looked at the follower who had followed him for many years and slapped him.The force was so great that it directly sent the follower's body flying. After he fell to the side, the follower hurriedly knelt down while trembling."I said that he's an ingrate because no matter what I say, I can be considered his senior brother. Although I don't like him very much, since the Teacher acknowledged him, I also acknowledge him.""But who do you think you are? How dare you say that about him in front of me?" Chen Feiyuan said coldly. That follower's entire body trembled and he kept kowtowing."Looking at how you've been with me for so many years, I will give you a good funeral," Chen Feiyuan said calmly. Amidst the terrified pleading of the follower, the other followers grabbed him and broke his neck. The surroundings fell silent.Chen Feiyuan didn't even take a look. He had a frown on his face as a look of contemplation appeared in his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly spoke."Activate all the spies I've raised over the years and get them to pay close attention to the movements of the Golden Core experts in the eight great families. I can give them whatever they want." T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ "Activate them all?" The followers behind Chen Feiyuan were stunned."Yes, all of them. I wonder how that ingrate Xu Qing's current strength is. I suspect that Purple Earth is also involved in Teacher's matter. He might be in danger if he barges in."'Not coming to see us was the correct choice. Tingyu is innocent. It's fine for her to do alchemy research but her temperament isn't firm enough. Once she reveals some clues and others discover that he's here, it's inevitable that they'll be tempted by the bounty of the Sea Corpse Race.''In fact, I even suspect that someone is trying to lure him with Teacher's death. Killing two birds with one stone, or maybe someone is just using Teacher's death to lay a trap and get benefits!'"I hope I'm thinking too much." Chen Feiyuan took a deep breath and pondered again.In the past two years, it was not only Xu Qing who had changed a lot. After Chen Feiyuan returned to Purple Earth and gained authority in his family, he had also changed greatly, especially in terms of his wisdom and schemes. At the same time, he was also deeply influenced by Grandmaster Bai's ideals and hated Purple Earth's current situation.After saying that, he looked at the two followers behind him."Have you made the arrangements?" The two followers nodded. However, the instant they nodded, their bodies suddenly trembled and their faces turned black. They spat out blood and died.'Don't blame me, I don't trust you guys either. Since you have finished the work, I can only send you guys on your way.' Chen Feiyuan muttered. In the entire Purple Earth, the only people he trusted were his teacher and Tingyu. Now that his teacher had been killed, only Tingyu was left.'As for the ingrate, he can be trusted as well. I wonder if he discovered the Daybreak Scattered Decay Pill… However, with his understanding of plants and vegetation, he should be able to discover the clues guided by the poison on Teacher's body.' Chen Feiyuan frowned and dealt with the corpses before leaving.At the same time, In Purple Earth's capital, Xu Qing walked in the darkness. His aura didn't leak out at all and his eyes were cold as he sped forward.The reason why he didn't meet Tingyu and Chen Feiyuan was indeed because he was worried that there would be additional complications. Xu Qing was very clear about his current value. He had also considered whether someone was using this matter to lure him here.However, he felt that even if there really was another force in play, it had nothing to do with the faction that assassinated Grandmaster Bai.He could already infer some clues from the loss of the Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill's pill formula. The other party was planning something huge."If someone is really luring me out, there's a high chance that it is people of Purple Earth. Perhaps I'm overthinking, but I still have to be vigilant."Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and sprinkled some poison powder on his body to hide his aura as he continued forward.He had found traces and clues of the suspected murderer.The red jade slip Old Master Seventh had given him had already mentioned the other party's characteristics. At the same time, it pointed out that the other party was from the Bizarre Fiend Race that was extremely difficult to capture.

Chapter 291 Using Bizarre Against Bizarre (2)
Although the captain had given him a way, Xu Qing had his own method.As long as one cultivated anomalous substances, they wouldn't be able to escape the sharp senses of the shadow. After all, it ate anomalous substances.Although there were many cultivators with dense anomalous substances in Purple Earth City, if the aura of the Forbidden Sea was included, the range would be reduced greatly.Things that were difficult to do for others weren't difficult for Xu Qing.The only thing he needed to do was to find the real murderer among the few candidates who met the requirements.This point was also simple.Xu Qing didn't believe that with his teacher's alchemy attainments, he wouldn't have left some marks. Even with Xu Qing's current attainments in herbs, he could still leave some undetectable medicinal herbs marks on the other party's body before he died.Hence, when Xu Qing was watching from the alley, he had paid attention to the teacher's corpse in the crystal coffin. He also sensed it through the soil in front of the grave.He confirmed that the poison in his teacher's body was called the Daybreak Scattered Decay Pill.This pill had a certain level of nourishing effect on the body and needed to be consumed all year round. To mortals, the effects were still alright. The only drawback was that after death, it would speed up the rotting of the corpse. Generally speaking, it could completely turn the corpse into liquid in 24 hours. Grandmaster Bai had refined it in his free time. It could be considered one of the unique pill formulas.Outsider's understanding of this pill would at most reach this extent.Only his disciples would know that the main ingredient of the Daybreak Scattered Decay Pill was the Soul Melting Fog."Soul fusion fog, also known as closed heavenly eyes. It's a high-level spirit herb born of fog. It can fuse a mark with the soul and is difficult to detect and remove. It's the main ingredient of the Daybreak Scattered Decay Pill."Xu Qing mumbled. This was the clue Grandmaster Bai had left for others.The soul of the murderer would definitely be tainted by this almost undetectable soul fusion fog. As for the method to detect it, Xu Qing naturally knew of it.Hence, he moved very fast. In the darkness, he arrived at one of the three clues marked by the shadow. This was an inn. After Xu Qing got close, he spread out his perception and left a moment later."Not this one."He didn't stop. Taking advantage of the darkness, he went to the second place. This was the residence of a commoner in the Purple Earth's imperial city. There were no fluctuations of cultivation base, not even anomalous substances.However, he couldn't escape the shadow's search.The moment he got close, Xu Qing stopped in his tracks. At the next instant, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. His body suddenly swayed and he directly entered the house.The house was simple and crude. An old man was lying there. The instant Xu Qing entered, he opened his eyes and looked at Xu Qing in surprise. Just as he was about to speak, the black iron stick buzzed and instantly neared him.The old man's body suddenly swayed. There were clearly no cultivation fluctuations emitted but it was as though he had entered the Mystic Brilliance Form. He actually dodged the black iron stick and appeared in front of Xu Qing."You actually found me? Your disguise is too fake. Let me see who you are." The old man's voice was low. As he spoke, he lifted his right hand and grabbed at Xu Qing's face.It was as though he wanted to erase the cover of his spell.However, at the next instant, the old man's expression suddenly changed. An intense sense of danger caused him to retreat abruptly.However, it was still too late. Xu Qing's body emitted an astonishing force. It was as though a continent was burning in his body. He ruthlessly kneed the old man.The old man's body shook violently and his chest, which was slammed into by Xu Qing's knee, instantly caved in. His flesh and bones were badly torn and shattered. Just as he was about to struggle, Xu Qing had already stepped over and released the fiendish fire. However, the other party didn't have a soul. Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. With a wave of his hand, Golden Crow Refines All Life spread out behind him and sucked fiercely at the old man.This time, the old man's entire body trembled and he instantly transformed into qi and blood. After Golden Crow Refines All Life sucked him, only a piece of skin was left on the ground.Xu Qing wasn't surprised. The shadow under his feet quickly spread over. After enveloping the skin, it transmitted a message to Xu Qing."Lead the way!"The shadow quickly guided him. Xu Qing put away the arrangements that hid the energy fluctuations in the surroundings and rushed toward the place pointed by the shadow.He knew that the Bizarre Fiend Race was strange and difficult to kill but it didn't matter. If he killed them a few more times, the other party would eventually be unable to escape. The only thing that made Xu Qing ponder was that the other party had died too quickly under Golden Crow Refines All Life, so he was only able to absorb an insignificant amount of the other party's origin."The origin of the Bizarre Fiend Race is strange. Moreover, he died too quickly and I couldn't absorb much. However, it's fine… After making him afraid and anxious, I should be able to absorb more."At that moment, in the Zhou family of the eight great families, a handyman who was sleeping suddenly opened his eyes. A hint of surprise appeared in his eyes as he hurriedly took a few breaths and quickly looked around."Who is that guy? Not only did he find me, but his cultivation is also astonishing enough to directly suppress my vessel that has been condensed for a long time. Its combat strength was comparable to three fires!""It's a pity that due to the limitations of my talent, I can only parasitize a mortal. Every one of them needs to be slowly nurtured before I can gradually display my strength. Otherwise, it would be much simpler for me to escape. Damn it, this mission was originally very simple. Although the teleportation was sealed, it couldn't be sealed for too long. But now, why is there such a strange cultivator!" T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ The handyman's gaze flickered. As he pondered, a hint of malice appeared as he looked around."However, it's fine. This person I revived as is a servant of the Zhou family. His residence is in the territory of the Zhou family's imperial palace. Unless that person gets the Zhou family to help him, he will definitely die if he dares to sneak in!"Just like that, under this person's attention and vigilance, the night passed. The next morning, as the sunlight streamed in, a scar-faced burly man with Qi Condensation cultivation pushed open the door of the house where these handymen were.When the surrounding handymen saw this scar-faced man, their expressions changed. They hurriedly stood up, not daring to stop at all. This scar-faced man could be considered a trusted aide among the Zhou family's handymen. He would casually beat and scold them, and many of them were beaten to death by him.The handyman's lives were cheap. No one cared if they died.Amidst their nervousness, the scar-faced man spat out some saliva and walked toward them. He passed by the handymen one after another until he reached the handyman who was parasitized by the Bizarre Fiend Race.After sizing him up, the scar-faced burly dude suddenly took out a saber and stabbed into the handyman's heart. He quickly pulled it out and ruthlessly slit the handyman's neck!Everything happened too quickly, so much so that the handyman only had the time to widen his eyes in disbelief and confusion.He didn't understand what was going on. The scar-faced burly dude laughed sinisterly. As all the handymen in the surroundings retreated in horror, the burly dude cut open his own stomach and took out his intestines. He wrapped them around the neck of the handyman and leaned over to speak softly."My master greets you. He asked me to tell you that the game… has just begun."

Chapter 292 Nowhere To Hide
The eyes of the bizarre fiend narrowed. In an instant, his body died.At the next instant, in the Purple Earth Bai Family's territory, among the seven to eight homeless people lying in a cramped alley, a skinny youth covered in dirt suddenly opened his eyes.The instant he opened his eyes, he instinctively pressed his neck, his eyes revealing horror. He quickly looked around and took a few breaths before his expression recovered.However, there was still some panic in his eyes."What's going on? That person just now…" This youth was none other than that member of the Bizarre Fiend Race. Although he was surprised when Xu Qing found his first host, he didn't think much of it.The second host was located in the hinterland of the Zhou family. He was originally filled with confidence that unless the other party contacted the Zhou family to make a move, it was impossible for him to barge in. Once the Zhou family was contacted, he would be able to find out the other party's identity.He had already thought of a way to make use of this opportunity to escape. At that time, he could even turn the tables and let the other party know how terrifying the Bizarre Fiend Race was.In addition, although Purple Earth's teleportation to the outside world had been sealed, he wasn't too panicked. Such a thing clearly couldn't last long. In his judgment, the blockade would definitely be lifted in three to five days at most.At that time, no one would be able to find him. Even Golden Core cultivators or Nascent Soul cultivators could kill him once but he would still escape in the end.He had experienced too many similar things. However, this was the only time this cultivator felt that something was amiss.Not only did the other party find his second identity in an extremely fast time, but the person who arrived even gave him a bizarre feeling.This was especially so when the other party took out his own intestines and wrapped them around his neck and leaned over to say those words. This caused the heart of this bizarre fiend to tremble again."My master greets you. He asked me to tell you that the game… has just begun.""The game has just begun…" The cultivator mumbled and his body trembled. He realized that he was in trouble. Not only was the other party powerful, but he also had some special methods."Should I activate that body…" The cultivator hesitated for a moment and looked around with a hint of unwillingness. He had prepared a body for himself outside the city that could be activated at any time.However, once he used it, it meant that he had to leave the Purple Earth's capital. This made him a little hesitant. After all, as long as he persisted in hiding here for a few more days, the blockade might end."Perhaps it's just a coincidence!" The bizarre fiend took a deep breath and warily looked around. The sun had risen and the other homeless people in the alley were waking up one after another. The bizarre fiend cultivator hurriedly walked toward the entrance of the alley.His footsteps were a little weak. Although his innate ability was strong, every time he woke up in a new host, the host was already devoured by him. To a certain extent, it was just a corpse.After he occupied someone's body, his strength became ordinary and needed time to recover his combat strength.Unless he buried some innate power in the host in advance. However, this method consumed too much energy, so he put his soul only on the body outside the city.As he quickly walked forward, his mind was still rapidly operating."Damn it, in the past, it was always me in the dark and others in the light. This time, it's the other way around. Who exactly is that guy? I've never heard of such a strange thing.""He can control others? That's not right. Any control would emit some energy, unless it's a divine sense possession. However, only Nascent Soul cultivators can do such a thing and it can't be done many times.""That person isn't a Nascent Soul cultivator. The feeling he gives me is that he used a bizarre entity." As the bizarre fiend cultivator kept analyzing, he walked out of the alley and walked warily along the corner of the street, quickly walking toward the teleportation array of Purple Earth.He was going to stay near the teleportation array for the next period of time. While waiting for the teleportation array to be unsealed, he would also see if the person who was hiding in the dark and deliberately mystifying things could find him again.However, less than an hour after he walked out, the instant he passed by another alley, a hand suddenly pressed down on his mouth from the depths of the darkness. A finger even reached in and forcefully propped up his mouth to prevent him from biting his tongue to commit suicide.Everything happened too quickly. Although the bizarre fiend reacted, this body was much slower. At the next instant, a huge force dragged his body into the alley.The bizarre fiend tried to see the other party's appearance, but he couldn't even turn his head. Not long later, he was brought to an abandoned house and pressed to the ground.Only then did he see the person in front of him. It was the middle-aged cultivator who had killed his first body yesterday.The other party's eyes were filled with endless coldness. The instant their gazes met, the mind of the bizarre fiend cultivator shook. At the next instant, his chin was forcefully broken off and the intense pain caused the veins on his forehead to bulge.As such, he couldn't bite his tongue and commit suicide. Moreover, with his cultivation and combat strength that hadn't recovered, he couldn't commit suicide in front of the other party anyway."Uuggh…" Just as the bizarre fiend cultivator was about to make a sound, Xu Qing coldly scattered some poison powder on him.The toxicity of this poison powder wasn't high. Xu Qing had mixed it in the past. As for the effects of this poison powder, after some adjustment, it could increase the sensitivity of the body to all stimuli.As the poison powder drifted and gradually sank into the other party's body, Xu Qing expressionlessly pinched the finger of the bizarre fiend cultivator.Crack, crack.​ He crushed it bit by bit.The bizarre fiend cultivator's body trembled from the pain. With the poison powder magnifying the already intense pain infinitely, the pain transformed into a storm that turned into a mournful cry.Even though his chin was broken, the sound formed by the intense pain still couldn't be stopped from coming from his throat.Xu Qing's expression didn't change at all. Only hatred rose in his eyes as he completely crushed the other party's hand into meat paste. After that, he fed the other party a medicinal pill to keep him awake.He continued. This was because although this bizarre fiend cultivator was screaming miserably, his eyes didn't reveal the fear Xu Qing was familiar with.From the start to the end, although the other party was screaming miserably and was in pain, he wasn't afraid!Xu Qing's gaze became even colder. Gradually, the other party's entire arm turned into minced meat. After that, Xu Qing also crushed his other hand bit by bit.He took out a dagger and began to cut the legs of the bizarre fiend cultivator even while the latter screamed and weakened. He didn't let go of any inch of his skin.There was blood all over the ground but the bizarre fiend wasn't dead yet. This was because Xu Qing's medicinal pills provided him with life force.Blood-curdling screams rang out once again. However, amidst these blood-curdling screams, a hint of provocation slowly appeared in the eyes of the bizarre fiend."Do you know why I am screaming? It's because you're not the first to do this to me, nor will you be the last. I've already grasped the method to transmit the pain through my voice." The voice came out from within the body of the bizarre fiend.The blood-curdling screams came out along with the voice as though he had split into two persons."Because I know that you don't dare to kill me so easily. You're taking revenge for Grandmaster Bai, right? Before that old man died, he was writing a letter. I wonder who he was writing it to. It couldn't be you, right?""Although I don't know how you found me, I think you're more concerned about the person behind me and want to find the mastermind, right? I know this. I have all the answers you want, but I… won't tell you."This cultivator's eyes were red and he screamed endlessly. Xu Qing punched and shattered his mouth. The minced meat sealed his mouth, causing him to be unable to scream.However, the voice from his body was laughing wildly."Do you know how I killed that old man? Haha, I originally wanted to parasitize that chick called Tingyu, but I didn't think it was fun enough. Guess who I parasitized in the end?"Xu Qing stopped and looked at the bizarre fiend. His eyes gradually narrowed as a terrifying energy fluctuation slowly spread out from his body.This scene caused the mind of the bizarre fiend cultivator to tremble. In reality, there were still some slight differences between what he had said and what he was thinking. He was indeed not afraid of death and was used to torture. However, Xu Qing's ruthlessness still caused his heart to tremble violently.This was especially so since the other party didn't ask or say a word from the start. 𝕿𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖈𝖍𝖆𝖕𝖙𝖊𝖗 𝖚𝖕𝖑𝖔𝖆𝖉 𝖋𝖎𝖗𝖘𝖙 𝖆𝖙 𝖓𝖔𝖛𝖊𝖑-𝖇𝖎𝖓.𝖈𝖔𝖒  It was as though the other party didn't care about anything and was only immersed in the torture. His movements were proficient and he didn't show any hesitation. He even avoided the major blood vessels.This scene made him realize… that the other party had done this too many times in the past."This is a lunatic, a pervert!!"Hence, he wanted to anger the other party and make him kill him. Although he had long set an irreversible time of death for each of his host bodies, this time, he wanted to die early.Xu Qing looked at the cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race in front of him. The totemic tattoo on his back flickered and black flames rose around him. It didn't transform into the Golden Crow's shadow but fused into Xu Qing's right hand. Xu Qing then pressed his right hand on the forehead of the bizarre fiend.At the next instant, a huge suction force erupted from his hand. The eyes of the bizarre fiend cultivator suddenly widened and his body started withering rapidly. A large amount of qi and blood rose and headed straight for Xu Qing's right hand. It was also because of the intense fluctuations in his emotions earlier that a trace of origin fog was finally revealed and extracted.This trace of fog was the origin power of the Bizarre Fiend Race.Back then, when Xu Qing attacked for the first time, he didn't manage to absorb the other party's origin. Hence, this time, he tortured him and caused his emotions to fluctuate intensely to be more convenient to absorb his origin power.The instant before the bizarre fiend cultivator died, Xu Qing spoke softly and his only sentence since the start of the torture entered the ears of the bizarre fiend cultivator."It's not over. We'll see each other in a while."

Chapter 293 Bird In The Cage
No more screams rang out in the abandoned house. It was completely silent.Xu Qing closed his eyes and sensed the special wisp of origin source that the Golden Crow had absorbed. It was just that it was too small and couldn't be used properly. However, it was enough for tracking purposes."Then… if he revives again, he will definitely be even more terrified. However, this much isn't enough. I need to kill him dozens of times before I can get enough origin." Xu Qing opened his eyes and looked at his shadow.His shadow was spread on the blood on the ground. After it covered the dried corpse, it permeated it and returned after a few breaths of time. The emotions it transmitted pointed in another direction as well as a pleading request."Capture… I'm good… capturing…"The torture earlier was partly because of the viciousness in Xu Qing's heart, partly because he wanted the Golden Crow to devour the bizarre fiend, and partly because he wanted to give the shadow enough time to devour the other party's shadow and determine its direction more accurately.This way, coupled with the trace of origin energy he had obtained, he could accurately find the other party no matter where he was hiding.At that moment, sensing the shadow's earnest request, Xu Qing thought about it and nodded.The shadow instantly emitted cheerful emotions, as though it felt that this was very fun and exciting.Xu Qing's expression was calm. He turned and disappeared from the house, hiding all the way. He had a faint feeling that someone had been observing him during these two days.This feeling was becoming increasingly clear. Xu Qing didn't want to be noticed by Purple Earth, so he concealed himself even more.An hour later, outside the eastern gate of the Purple Earth's capital, a large number of people were queuing up and leaving the city one after another. Most of them were carriages and there were also cultivators.Among them was a youth. This youth was wearing expensive clothes and didn't look to be from an ordinary family. However, he didn't have the privilege to leave the city quickly and needed to queue here. This also showed that his bloodline wasn't noble.At that moment, the youth's face was a little pale and his breathing was hurried. From time to time, he would check his surroundings. He… was none other than the cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race.In the end, he didn't choose to use the body outside the city. This was because once he used it and was chased far away, he wouldn't be able to return to the capital after he died.His innate ability had a range limit.To him, the place with the most lives was the place where his ability could be displayed to the greatest extent. Hence, he didn't want to leave easily. Moreover, if that body died, the damage to him would be much more serious than the other bodies.He was going to use his current body to fake his departure from the city and lure the mysterious pursuer away before returning immediately. After all, it didn't affect him much even if this body died.He had been found three times in a row. This made him aware that the other party must have a way to pursue him. He didn't know what this method was and couldn't guard against it.This caused the uneasiness in his heart to be extremely intense, especially when he witnessed the other party's cruelty and heard his last sentence. It was as though a cold wind had blown into his mind and stayed there without dissipating.Most importantly, after he revived this time, he had an indescribable feeling. It was as though he had lost some of the most important things on him.This feeling caused him to feel a life-and-death crisis for the first time."Too strange, but I don't believe it. With my methods, how could I be locked onto?!"While the youth's heart was fluctuating, he didn't notice that an eye had appeared in the shadow of the guard at the city gate not far away and glanced at him. 𝕿𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖈𝖍𝖆𝖕𝖙𝖊𝖗 𝖚𝖕𝖑𝖔𝖆𝖉 𝖋𝖎𝖗𝖘𝖙 𝖆𝖙 𝖓𝖔𝖛𝖊𝖑-𝖇𝖎𝖓.𝖈𝖔𝖒  At the next instant, just as the youth was about to reach the city gate, a mosquito flew over and silently landed on the youth's neck. Before the youth could notice, it stabbed fiercely at the blood vessel on his neck.It transmitted its divine sense softly."My master greets you."After that, its body exploded, sending the little black bugs contained in its body into the youth's body.In that instant, the youth's entire body trembled and he let out a mournful cry. As the crowd dispersed in panic, he fell to the ground and rolled continuously. Finally, his body turned into a blood pool.The body of a guard at the city gate suddenly trembled. When his eyelids closed and opened again, he had already turned to someone else.He took advantage of the chaos and turned to leave the city without saying a word. However, his body suddenly paused and stiffened.Shock appeared in his eyes. He wanted to lower his head but couldn't do so. His body seemed to be out of his control and a weak laughter that caused his hair to stand on end came out from his mouth."Aha, I've made a contribution. I caught you."As he spoke, the guard slowly turned around. The corners of his mouth curled up into a smile. After greeting the other guards beside him, he walked forward happily.As he walked, numerous eyes rapidly disappeared from the shadows of all the guards in the vicinity and the people queuing up, merging into his feet.Everyone here… had eyes planted on their shadows. Clearly, it was indeed good at playing hide-and-seek. After finding the cultivator of the Bizarre Fiend Race, it parasitized everyone in its vicinity and waited for the other party to arrive.As for the bizarre fiend cultivator, he had miscalculated and fallen into the shadow's trap.At that moment, his eyes were filled with intense fear. He had never encountered such a thing in his life. His heart trembled and his mind was about to collapse.For the first time, he was terrified.This was because he realized that he had encountered a bizarre existence that was even more terrifying than himself!Just like that, amidst the joy of the shadow, the guard hopped away from the crowd and went to another abandoned house in an alley.There were many abandoned houses in the Purple Earth's capital due to frequent deaths here.As he walked in, the bizarre fiend cultivator saw Xu Qing sitting inside with a calm expression, waiting for him.After seeing Xu Qing, the guard who was controlled by the shadow and possessed by the Bizarre Fiend Race directly knelt down with a plop. His hands kept slapping his face again and again.Xu Qing's gaze swept over but he didn't bother with it. He looked outside the door."Since you're here, why didn't you come in?" Xu Qing calmly spoke.The guard controlled by the shadow paused for a moment before continuing to slap.As Xu Qing spoke, very soon, a youth walked out of the distortion outside the door.He wore a gorgeous robe and a jade pendant that emitted a gentle light. He was very handsome but his gaze was complicated as he looked at Xu Qing. It was… Chen Feiyuan.Xu Qing looked at Chen Feiyuan. The aura on the other party's body was weird. There were clearly no strong cultivation base fluctuations and his aura was extremely weak but it gave Xu Qing a dangerous feeling.This was also the reason why even the shadow didn't notice that it was being followed."You've become a treasure-nurturer?" Xu Qing suddenly asked.He sensed the issue. Chen Feiyuan's cultivation was only at the Qi Condensation Realm, but the energy fluctuations on his body seemed to be swimming in his bloodline. Moreover, it clearly emitted the feeling of time, as though there was an item stored in his body."Not a treasure-nurturer. The direct descendants of the eight great families of Purple Earth can form a symbiosis with their family's only magic treasure. After I returned, I had already begun to come into contact with it and was in a symbiotic relation with a portion of it. In reality, this is also the reason why every generation of patriarchs of the Purple Earth's eight families has astonishing combat strength.""When we cultivate, although cultivation is important, bloodline is more important." Chen Feiyuan walked in and sat at the side, looking at the bizarre fiend cultivator who was slapping himself."What a strange cultivation method," Xu Qing said softly."The royal family of the Purple Green Kingdom is the strange one. This is their bloodline talent. They can form symbiosis with all magic treasures. Later on, they were plundered by our eight races. After countless years of rearing and reproducing, we were finally able to fuse this bloodline talent into our bloodlines."Chen Feiyuan shrugged and looked at Xu Qing."I haven't congratulated you on your rise in the Seven Blood Eyes.""You've changed a lot," Xu Qing said seriously.In his memory, Chen Feiyuan wasn't like this. In reality, in the past few days, he had faintly sensed that someone was secretly observing him. However, he couldn't find any traces until today when the other party appeared."I have grown up and also because of Teacher's inheritance and the influence of the magic treasure." Chen Feiyuan shook his head."Besides, your changes aren't small either. I didn't expect the brat back then to have become one of the Sequences of the Seven Blood Eyes."Chen Feiyuan swept his gaze across Xu Qing and landed on the bizarre fiend who was slapping himself. His eyes were filled with killing intent."That's him?""One of the bodies." Xu Qing nodded."I went to the place you were in last time and there was a stench of blood. This… let me play with it." Chen Feiyuan's eyes were filled with cruelty and madness, containing deep hatred as he stared fixedly at the bizarre fiend.Xu Qing nodded and stood up to walk out of the house. The shadow also returned and gave up control. At the next instant, mournful cries and wails rang out from the room.This sound lasted for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. The degree of misery was almost the same as the last time Xu Qing attacked.Finally, Chen Feiyuan walked out of the room. His body was still trembling slightly, as though the viciousness and madness in his heart still couldn't dissipate. His eyes were even redder. When he arrived beside Xu Qing, he took a deep breath."Tingyu guessed that you were here but I told her that you didn't come."​ "The families in Purple Earth haven't sensed your arrival yet. The news has been sealed and hidden by me. However, my ability is limited and I can't seal the information for long. However, I'll do my best. You can take revenge for Teacher in peace and leave as soon as possible after it's over. Otherwise, there will be a huge crisis.""The old geezers who aren't willing to die just like that are very tempted by the bounty of the Sea Corpse Race. These people are no longer human. In order to survive, they are willing to do anything.""Take care of yourself," Chen Feiyuan said in a low voice. After he finished speaking, he walked into the distance.Xu Qing looked at Chen Feiyuan and suddenly spoke."Senior Brother, take care."Xu Qing saw a trace of Grandmaster Bai's temperament on Chen Feiyuan. It was hatred for Purple Earth and determination to try to change it.Chen Feiyuan stopped in his tracks but didn't turn his head. He continued walking, becoming more and more determined until he disappeared into the void.

Chapter 294 Dancing In The Palm Of His Hand
Xu Qing walked into the house.That cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race was lying there with his limbs spread out. All the flesh in his body was gone. Other than his intact head, there was only a skeleton left.However, he wasn't dead yet. A red light swam on his bones, supporting his life.Clearly, Chen Feiyuan had a special method that let him vent his anger while keeping the bizarre fiend alive. When Xu Qing walked over, the cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race opened his eyes and looked at Xu Qing listlessly.Xu Qing lifted his hand and pressed down on the other party's forehead. Golden Crow Refines All Life instantly started absorbing. As the other party's head trembled, more origin power was absorbed and fused into Xu Qing's body.At the next instant, the bizarre fiend cultivator died.At the same time, outside the Purple Earth capital, in a mass grave, an explosion occurred. The ground was blasted open by a huge force, and soil and shattered bones scattered in all directions. A middle-aged man with disheveled hair slowly walked out.His expression was malevolent and his eyes revealed madness. However, in the depths of that madness, there was unprecedented fear."All of them are perverts!"This burly dude was none other than the cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race that was known to be undying!This body was a relatively perfect body that he had spent some price to nurture in advance and let it sleep until now. It could completely display his three fires cultivation.Originally, he didn't want to use this body because once this body died, it would affect him as well. However, he had no choice now.He didn't dare to stay in the city anymore.Regardless of whether it was within the eight great families or outside, he felt that the city was very dangerous. The other party was pursuing him like the marrow sticking to the bones, causing his heart to tremble. In particular, that bizarre entity caused him to feel an unprecedented sense of danger.To a certain extent, that bizarre entity was similar to him. This allowed this bizarre fiend to experience the feelings of the people he had assassinated.It was everywhere!At the thought of this, the burly dude's body trembled. He quickly looked around and only heaved a sigh of relief after confirming that he was already far away from the Purple Earth Imperial Capital."They shouldn't find me so quickly this time, especially at such a distance. I might be able to escape."Even now, he still didn't know the other party's identity. His expression was gloomy as he fled rapidly. He even activated his life fires and entered the Mystic Brilliance Form, increasing his speed."After the first time he killed me, he used a night to find me. The second time was two hours, the third time was an hour…"Five minutes later, the expression of the burly man suddenly changed. When he turned his head, he saw a rainbow in the distant horizon whistling toward him with an earth-shattering aura.The figure in the rainbow looked like a middle-aged man. There seemed to be a continent burning in his body and his aura rumbled in all directions, as though it could suppress everything.Even with his three fires cultivation, his eyes still stung when he took a look."So fast!" 𝕿𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖈𝖍𝖆𝖕𝖙𝖊𝖗 𝖚𝖕𝖑𝖔𝖆𝖉 𝖋𝖎𝖗𝖘𝖙 𝖆𝖙 𝖓𝖔𝖛𝖊𝖑-𝖇𝖎𝖓.𝖈𝖔𝖒  Unprecedented horror caused the burly dude to gasp. He had made a judgment about Xu Qing, but from what he saw now, he discovered that all his judgments were inaccurate.The aura the other party displayed at this moment gave him a feeling that it surpassed three fires. That was…"Four fires?"Sweat broke out on the burly dude's forehead. He didn't hesitate at all to burn the three balls of life fire in his body with all his might. His speed soared explosively as he ran crazily into the distance.He didn't guess wrongly. Xu Qing, who was chasing after him, indeed possessed the power of four flames!The ignition of the life lantern allowed Xu Qing to possess the combat strength of two fires when he had just formed one life fire. When he formed the second ball of life fire rose, his combat strength reached three fires. With the enhancement from Golden Crow Refines All Life, his combat strength was naturally comparable to four fires!The reason why he was able to catch up to the bizarre fiend so quickly was because he no longer needed the shadow to guide him.As the origin source absorbed by Golden Crow Refines All Life fused into Xu Qing's body, the bizarre fiend cultivator was like a torch in the night in Xu Qing's perception.As such, the instant the other party revived, he had already sensed it and rushed over rapidly. He arrived here in the time it took for an incense stick to burn.The instant he saw the other party, the killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes intensified.His speed was so fast that everything was slow in his eyes. The burly dude's speed was the same. In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing arrived in front of him and directly slapped down.The burly dude was violently slammed to the ground like a kite with a broken string.The ground caved in. Just as the burly dude was about to get up, Xu Qing neared him and kicked his chest.The burly dude spurted out blood again. When his body rolled back, Xu Qing had already taken out a dagger and stabbed him.He kept on stabbing again and again. He then forcefully ripped off the burly dude's right arm before smashing his forehead.The burly dude let out a blood-curdling scream as his skull shattered. He was already in an extremely miserable state. In front of Xu Qing, the power of three fires had no chance of retaliating. The horror and despair in his eyes also reached the extreme.They then turned into madness as he roared at the sky. The moment Xu Qing got close, he charged forward and tried to detonate his life fires.However, before the aura of its destruction spread out, the shadow had long fused into its body and pounced at the three balls of life fire.In an instant, the volcano in the burly dude's body was extinguished.His body was forcefully broken from the Mystic Brilliance Form, causing a huge backlash. This caused many of his magic apertures to collapse.His entire body was badly mangled as he fell to the ground.The horror in his eyes grew even more intense. As though he had guessed the torture waiting for him, he waved his left hand that could still move and slapped his forehead, wanting to commit suicide.However, a black iron stick instantly appeared and pierced into his raised left hand.Xu Qing walked toward him with eyes filled with killing intent. Behind him, there was a cry as the Golden Crow appeared. It danced in the sky before pouncing on him and sucking fiercely.The bizarre fiend cultivator's body trembled violently. The instant his mind was shaken, the qi and blood in his entire body erupted. It also contained his origin power and was swallowed by the Golden Crow.After that, what welcomed him was Xu Qing's fingers piercing into his eyes, shattering his eyeball and destroying his head.The moment before he died, a voice that was like a nightmare to him calmly rang out in his ears."Don't be so quick to give me the answer I want. I still want to play a few more times. We will see each other in a while."At the next instant, in a wilderness outside Purple Earth city, a rabbit suddenly jumped up from the bush. Its speed was extremely fast and it spared no expense to run into the distance.However, in just the time it took for half an incense stick to burn, a black dot appeared in the sky. This black dot headed straight for the rabbit at an astonishing speed.It was a vulture. It instantly neared the rabbit but didn't grab it. Instead, it collided with the rabbit, causing it to be badly mangled. Before it perished together, the vulture let out a sinister voice."Hello."The rabbit died.In the blink of an eye, at another location, a snake slowly climbed under the withered tree.However, in less than eight minutes, a black iron stick whistled from afar and instantly pierced through the snake, pinning it to the ground.The snake died with lingering fear in its eyes. After that, an eagle that was flying in the sky paused for a moment before speeding up.What awaited it was the Golden Crow which immediately devoured it.Such scenes continued to play out in this wilderness.Even though this bizarre fiend cultivator had displayed his talent to the extreme and used one host after another to try to escape, what awaited him was either the black iron stick that suddenly arrived, various creatures that had been parasitized, or Xu Qing.All of this caused his mind to be on the verge of collapse. Moreover, dying time and time again had exhausted him. Although the consumption wasn't great, he couldn't withstand these frequent deaths.This was especially so when he died to Xu Qing. Every time he died, he would feel that he was missing something important. In the end, when he revived in a coyote, he discovered that he didn't fuse into it immediately. Instead, there were some obstructions. He panicked."He's absorbing my talent!!"This discovery caused waves of emotions to surge in his mind.Hence, the instant Xu Qing grabbed it again and was about to absorb and refine it, he hurriedly spoke."I'll die completely in three times at most. If I die, you won't be able to find the mastermind!!"What welcomed him was Xu Qing's palm strike.With a boom, the coyote collapsed and the wisp of origin energy before it died was absorbed by the Golden Crow. Thirty breaths later, in the sky, a crow hurriedly spoke."You're from the Seven Blood Eyes. I can sense the energy of your cultivation art. I can reveal the mastermind, but I want to see Lord Sixth. I'll only tell him!!"The next instant, the black iron stick pierced through it. Xu Qing looked at the crow's corpse expressionlessly. After sensing again, he headed straight for the ground. His right foot stomped fiercely on the ground and the ground instantly split open, revealing a gap in which a pangolin was hiding.The pangolin trembled and despair appeared in its eyes as it transmitted a frenzied divine sense."Come, kill me. Don't even think about finding out the answer after I die. Bring me to see Lord Sixth. I'll only tell him!!"Xu Qing slapped it fiercely.The pangolin had a crazed expression. Although its mind was about to collapse and the danger of death enveloped it like never before, it still didn't speak.Xu Qing stopped slapping it. He held it in front of him and stared coldly.Only after a long while did Xu Qing retract his gaze. He grabbed the pangolin and walked toward the teleportation point that the captain had personally opened for him. That place wasn't far from here and it didn't take long for Xu Qing to reach it.This place was a valley. Xu Qing walked in expressionlessly. There was an abandoned teleportation array here. Standing on it, Xu Qing took out his identity token and pressed it, waiting silently.Not long later, the teleportation array started shining.However, the instant the teleportation array was activated, the pangolin in Xu Qing's hand suddenly trembled. Its body withered and it died. At the same time that it died, the teleportation array shone as though the teleportation had completed. Someone teleported away before Xu Qing.It was that bizarre fiend cultivator. He clearly had laid a trap earlier. His goal was to make use of the teleportation array to escape.Moreover, it was unknown what method he used, but it caused the location of his teleportation to be blurry. Outsiders couldn't know the exact location.A moment later, the teleportation light dissipated. Xu Qing was still inside.The other party had clearly escaped, but Xu Qing's expression didn't show the slightest surprise or anger. His gaze was calm as he lowered his head and looked at the pangolin's corpse in his hand, tossing it to the side.He closed his eyes and started sensing. After a moment, Xu Qing opened his eyes, revealing a deep glint."I'm in a hurry. I hope you can meet the person you're meeting soon."

Chapter 295 So It's You!
Not far from the Seven Blood Eyes and near the edge of the Forbidden Sea, a teleportation array that was originally abandoned started shining. A wisp of fog appeared on it and quickly condensed into a fog body.After walking out of the teleportation array, it immediately destroyed the array formation. Only then did it heave a sigh of relief and started laughing."In the end, your grandfather still managed to escape!" As the fog body condensed, it slowly transformed into the appearance of a middle-aged man. At this moment, his expression was filled with unprecedented smugness.Around the end, it could be said that he had let himself be caught by Xu Qing. He wanted to make use of the teleportation array and use the secret art given by his employer to escape.Everything went smoothly."I didn't waste much time either. The next step is to trade with the employer. I've completely memorized the second volume of the Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill. Only I know of it now. If they don't give me the item they promised me, they can forget about obtaining the formula."The middle-aged man sneered and quickly left.Under the moonlight, his body sped through the wilderness, but he didn't notice that an eye had opened in his shadow.Even though he was a bizarre entity, he still had a shadow. As long as there was a shadow, there would be Xu Qing's shadow.Xu Qing had let him go on purpose.As for the other party wanting to see Lord Sixth, Xu Qing didn't believe it. Since the other party didn't say anything even after so much torture and deaths, Xu Qing might as well let him think that it was safe. Only then would the bizarre fiend lead him to the mastermind!As for the range of the shadow eye, Xu Qing had already checked it when he was searching for the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts. It had an extremely large range, and currently, it was still within his perception. Although the vision was somewhat blurry because of the distance, it was not a big issue.Moreover, just knowing the location was enough.Xu Qing opened his eyes and adjusted the array formation, activating the teleportation array in the direction of his perception. As for the other teleportation array being destroyed, it didn't matter. After knowing the location, he could simply use other teleportation arrays nearby.At the next instant, Xu Qing's figure disappeared.At that moment, the middle-aged man formed by fog was moving extremely fast in the coastal area of the Nanhuang Continent. He took advantage of the darkness and sped all the way. During this time, he would look around frequently and even spread out his perception to investigate the surroundings.Even though he had repeatedly confirmed that no one was following him, he was still very cautious. However, the strangeness of the shadow was something he didn't understand, so he didn't know that there was an eye in his shadow.However, this bizarre fiend cultivator was still vigilant. He didn't head to the meeting place immediately. Instead, he moved randomly for an entire night before he arrived at a seaside and looked at a merchant ship that was docked in the distance."Come over. I've already got what you want."He then waited silently while observing his surroundings. However, he wasn't able to see the eye in the shadow that was slightly open and was watching him.Nothing happened even after a long while. The bizarre fiend cultivator turned and changed directions. Everything that had happened earlier was intentional. He was making sure that nobody followed him and that he was really safe.He finally felt at ease and a hint of smugness appeared on his face again. In the darkness of dawn, he moved in another direction and reached the seaside. He didn't hesitate to jump in.At the next instant, the body of a swordfish swimming in the sea suddenly trembled before speeding away in another direction. However… the shadow's eye had parasitized the main body of the bizarre fiend. Hence, even though the other party had a new body now, the shadow eye still existed.The strange abilities of the bizarre entities depended on their levels. The strangeness of the shadow clearly far surpassed that of the bizarre fiend. It could even be said to be a natural enemy. At the same time, the shadow also had some slight emotional fluctuations.It seemed to have discovered that it was more compatible with the Bizarre Fiend Race. If the one it parasitized back then wasn't Xu Qing but a bizarre fiend… At the thought of this, the shadow suddenly interrupted its thoughts and a hint of disgust surfaced.It felt that the bizarre fiend Race wasn't worthy of being compared to it, let alone Demon Xu. The bizarre fiend Race was only its food. Why would it have the thought of parasitizing food?The shadow felt humiliated by its own thoughts. At the same time, it felt a little frightened as it recalled its experience of being tortured by Demon Xu.Hence, it perked up and observed even more diligently while providing directions to Xu Qing.The cultivator from the Bizarre Fiend Race had no idea about all of this.Just like that, time flowed by. The swordfish he was hosting swam rapidly in the sea and traveled everywhere. During this time, he changed to seven to eight sea beasts. Finally, on the next night, he appeared in a starfish.As the waves rose and fell, this starfish was swept to a black beach that could be considered the territory of the Seven Blood Eyes.The seawater dissipated, leaving behind black water foam on the ground. The bright moon hung in the sky and the moonlight landed on the water foam, emitting a faint light.The starfish that was possessed by the bizarre fiend lay motionless on the beach.Time slowly passed and dawn arrived. The dawn of a new day… carried a dim black color. The moment the moon left and the sun had yet to rise, something silently approached.In the darkness of dawn, figures walked over from the darkness in the distance.There were a total of four figures.They were all wearing black Daoist robes that covered their entire bodies and heads, making it impossible to see their appearances. The wide Daoist robes also hid their races and gender.There were also no cultivation base fluctuations from these four figures. Clearly, they had concealed themselves extremely deeply, and there was even a faint hazy feeling around their bodies. This was a method to block the senses of the array formation and prevent divine sense from locking onto them. It didn't seem to be the power of a magic artifact, and was more like a race' innate talent.These four figures walked toward the beach step by step.They slowly arrived beside the starfish and stopped.The figure at the front didn't move. The three people behind him quickly spread out and each took out a circular disc and placed it on the ground, as though they were checking something.In just a few breaths of time, the check was over. The three of them turned around and stood respectfully.The sea breeze blew over and spread in all directions, bringing with it the fishy smell of the seawater. When it invaded the coast, the wind also landed on the robe of the figure standing beside the starfish, causing it to flutter.It also slightly lifted the hood that covered the figure's head, revealing… a strand of blue hair!As this hair fluttered, the figure lowered their head and a crisp voice came out."You're late."As her voice , the starfish on the ground responded with a low voice."I was almost killed in Purple Earth. You didn't tell me that I would encounter such a pervert. That guy is much more bizarre than me!""This matter has also exceeded our expectations, but we will compensate you properly. Now, give me the thing." As the voice rang out, the wind grew stronger, completely blowing away the corner of the hood that was already slightly lifted, revealing a beautiful and delicate face.Her long blue hair fluttered in the wind, her blue eyes were resplendent, and her fair skin carried a gentle light like jade. She was none other than… the princess of the Starfish Race who had come to visit the Seven Blood Eyes!Back then, this princess had given Xu Qing a conch when she first saw him at Port 176. After that, during the period of the Seven Blood Eyes, she visited Xu Qing many times to talk. Back then, there didn't seem to be any scheming in her innocent eyes. There was only admiration for Xu Qing in her gaze.She had asked many questions in her conversation with Xu Qing and if one were to combine her questions, they would definitely be able to tell that… what was hidden in those questions was a probe toward Xu Qing's personality and habits.When one grasped a person's habits and personality, they could target this person and make some traps. Clearly, she had long had her eyes on Xu Qing and was preparing for the future."Heh, there's no hurry. You've secretly captured so many heaven's chosen of the various races over the years. There should be quite a lot of them from the Seven Blood Eyes as well. Now, you should already have a lot of main ingredients. You have to change the remuneration you promised me. I also want a Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill!"The girl took a deep look at the starfish on the ground. At this moment, another black-robed person from the Starfish Race suddenly spoke in a low voice."Princess, it's about time. If we delay any more, the power of the elders will be more limited and we won't be able to hide from the array formation.""We can only give you the reward once we return to our territory. Since you're worried, just come with me." The girl didn't hesitate. After she finished speaking, she was about to pick up the starfish on the ground.However, at this moment…A cold and murderous voice echoed in all directions."So it's you!"As soon as this voice appeared, the starfish on the ground trembled. Without any hesitation, it self-destructed and chose to commit suicide.At the same time, the expression of the Starfish Race's young girl changed and she quickly retreated. The other three Starfish Race cultivators in the surroundings also shook and their cultivation bases spread out, protecting the young girl as she retreated.However, it was still too late. At the next instant, a figure whistled over from afar like thunder. This figure no longer hid its appearance and no longer looked like a middle-aged man. Instead, it transformed into Xu Qing.It was as though there was a continent burning in his body as its fire towered into the sky. The pitch-black dawn broke and under the illumination of the sea of fire in Xu Qing's body, the whole area instantly lit up.The killing intent in his eyes was even more monstrous.The gigantic mosasaur under his feet also appeared with malevolence and hatred. That was a continuation of Xu Qing's emotions. Behind him, the huge Golden Crow cried toward the sky and black tail flames spread in all directions, as though a god had descended.  𝕋𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕔𝕙𝕒𝕡𝕥𝕖𝕣 𝕦𝕡𝕝𝕠𝕒𝕕 𝕗𝕚𝕣𝕤𝕥 𝕒𝕥 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝-𝕓𝕚𝕟.𝕔𝕠𝕞 At this moment, Xu Qing no longer held back. The killing intent he had suppressed until now erupted completely!With his shocking aura, he headed straight for the four people from the Starfish Race."Xu Qing!!" The eyes of the Starfish Race's princess narrowed and her expression changed. It was too late for her to retreat. Xu Qing instantly approached and sent a palm strike.The world rumbled and the surroundings trembled as the ground directly exploded.A huge pit was formed inside, stirring up a violent aura, causing the four Starfish cultivators to vomit blood.Someone blocked in front and endured Xu Qing's anger. His body collapsed and shattered into pieces and they were absorbed by the Golden Crow.His soul was also captured by Xu Qing and suppressed in his magic aperture. He didn't use it as a fuel to open magic apertures, but burned it in his aperture.The hearts of the other three shook and their expressions changed drastically.The three of them didn't hesitate at all. The cultivation bases in their bodies instantly erupted. One was three fires, two were two fires!That princess had three fires, while the two clansmen beside her had two fires.However, their cultivation bases were completely useless at this moment. In fact, the life fires in their bodies were swaying intensely. The incomparable killing intent from Xu Qing was like a storm of endless anger as it surged toward them.

Chapter 296 Blood Dyeing Clothes
Xu Qing had already restrained his killing intent for a long time.From the moment he found out that Grandmaster Bai had been assassinated, it was as though a sharp blade was crazily rampaging in his body, wanting to break out and kill everyone.However, he didn't. He forcefully suppressed this monstrous killing intent and forced himself to calm down. He then headed to Purple Earth with a calm mind as he had to be even more careful there. Even if he caught the murderer, he couldn't kill him.He could only torture the bizarre fiend slowly to dig out the mastermind.After such a long time, he finally found the mastermind. Now, he was unable to suppress the killing intent in his heart anymore. Xu Qing immediately arrived before a Starfish Race cultivator.This cultivator was a female. As Xu Qing got closer, the two fires in her body swayed intensely. Just as they were about to be extinguished, Xu Qing had already stretched out his right hand. It was filled with incomparable hatred, astonishing madness, and a terrifying aura. His right hand instantly broke through the woman's stomach and reached in.He grabbed a life fire and squeezed it ruthlessly!Boom! A tragic cry came out from the mouth of the female cultivator. This was an intense pain she had never endured in her life. It was the torture of her life fire being extinguished forcefully.This wasn't the end. After Xu Qing squeezed it, he grabbed the other ball of life fire. He directly pulled out both balls of life fire. As blood splattered everywhere, as the life fires collapsed, all the magic apertures in the female cultivator's body were destroyed.An even more mournful cry rang out before it rapidly weakened.The female cultivator bled from her seven orifices. However, Xu Qing's violence wasn't over. He slammed his head against the female cultivator's forehead. The woman's originally beautiful face exploded like a smashed fruit.Xu Qing's body was covered in blood. He turned his head with a gloomy expression and looked at the remaining two Starfish Race members, especially the princess.Behind him, the Golden Crow let out a cry and sucked fiercely at the corpse whose head had collapsed to the side. However, it seemed like it didn't get much. As such, it turned its head and looked at the Starfish Race princess savagely.Under the moonlight, Xu Qing's entire body emitted a baleful aura like a ferocious god. The Golden Crow at the side was like a peerless ferocious beast with an earth-shattering aura."Xu Qing, about this…"The Starfish Race princess' face was pale and her eyes revealed horror. Just as she spoke, the last Starfish Race Dao Protector beside her let out a roar and rushed out. "Princess, leave quickly!!"As he spoke, the Starfish Race cultivator's entire body shone. He burned his life fires and all his magic apertures erupted; an aura of self-destruction spread out from his body. He even performed a series of hand seals and activated the three discs set up in the surroundings.The three discs emitted an astonishing aura that transformed into bolts of lightning, forming a large net in the air that suppressed and bound Xu Qing.Seeing this, the Starfish Race's princess gritted her teeth and suddenly turned around, heading straight for the sea. She knew that she couldn't return to the Seven Blood Eyes and had to leave as soon as possible.However, just as she was about to enter the sea, a huge sea turtle suddenly rushed out from under the sea. Its eyes were filled with horror and despair. She didn't know how it did it but it actually let out a sinister laugh and bit at her.At the same time, a black iron stick also rushed out from Xu Qing's side. It formed black lightning in the air and headed straight for the Starfish Race's princess.In an instant, the turtle and the Starfish Race's princess collided. The power of the black iron stick also approached and struck her.The instant the lightning net formed by the three discs landed and was about to envelop and restrain Xu Qing, the power of Golden Crow Refines All Life erupted.The Golden Crow behind him cried at the sky and rushed up. Its huge body, the phoenix's tail, and the black flames formed the shape of '弓' as it headed for the sky. 🅃🄷🄸🅂 🄲🄷🄰🄿🅃🄴🅁 🅄🄿🄻🄾🄰🄳 🄵🄸🅁🅂🅃 🄰🅃 🄽🄾🅅🄴🄻-🄱🄸🄽.🄲🄾🄼 It directly collided with the lightning net. Almost in an instant, the lightning net collapsed and tore apart. With cracking sounds, the three surrounding discs also shattered into pieces.They couldn't stop it at all!The combat strength Xu Qing erupted with at this moment was comparable to four fires. A mere two fires cultivator wouldn't be able to cause any damage even if he had a magic artifact.At the next instant, Xu Qing appeared in front of the Starfish Race cultivator who was rushing over with the intention of self-destructing. He pressed his palm against the person's forehead. Under the indescribable horror and despair in the Starfish Race cultivator's eyes, Xu Qing fiercely inhaled.The fiendish fire erupted and the soul was forcefully sucked over. The pain of having his soul extracted alive caused the Starfish Race cultivator's screams to be sharp and shrill. While his body trembled intensely, the Golden Crow sucked from the air.Immediately, this cultivator's body spasmed as a large amount of qi and blood flowed out from his seven orifices and rose into the air. His soul and qi and blood were being extracted. The entire process only lasted for two breaths of time before the Starfish Race cultivator turned into a dried corpse. After he fell to the ground, he shattered and turned into ashes.At the same time, the face of the Starfish Race's princess, who was stopped by the turtle and the black iron stick, was extremely pale.She looked at her clansmen who had died in a short period and at Xu Qing who was walking toward her with an endless baleful aura.She recalled the scene of Xu Qing fighting against the black-clothed girl from Dongyou Island. She thought of the reason why the name of the Homicide Department was spread in the Seven Blood Eyes during this period of time and also thought of the other party's peerlessly beautiful face when she visited many times previously.All of this intertwined, forming surrealism and indescribable fear. She wanted to retreat, but it was too late. She had lost control of her body and mind, giving a chance to the Diamond Sect's ancestor. He pierced through her stomach and quickly flew back to pierce it again.As a blood-curdling scream came out from the Starfish Race princess' mouth, the sea turtle at the side opened its mouth and tore off the princess' arm.As he chewed, madness appeared on his face. However, his eyes revealed deep fear and a hint of pleading.This sea turtle was none other than the bizarre fiend cultivator. After he killed the starfish, he revived on a sea turtle at the bottom of the sea. Just as he was about to escape, he quickly discovered that his body had lost all control.He was familiar with this feeling and horror filled his mind. He couldn't do anything but watch in despair as the sea turtle happily swam toward the shore.The Starfish Race's princess, whose abdomen had been penetrated repeatedly and whose mind was about to collapse, revealed a pitiful expression. Her eyes were pleading and her body was trembling as she started crying."Xu Qing… I have my… reasons for this. I also…"Before she could finish speaking, Xu Qing had already gotten close and slapped her. The right side of the young girl's face instantly bulged. Her teeth broke and cracks appeared on her skull. Her nerves were also affected as her limbs twitched involuntarily a few times.Two of the life fires in her body were directly extinguished by Xu Qing's slap.Before she could recover, Xu Qing slapped her again.The young girl let out a sharp cry. The left side of her face was also puffed up and her gums bled severely. Her entire skull seemed to be about to collapse at this moment.The last life fire in her body was also extinguished. Xu Qing didn't stop. He ruthlessly kicked the wound on the young girl's stomach.The young girl's body was thrown up and blood gushed out of her injuries. All the magic apertures in her body shattered under this force and her cultivation was completely crippled.This intense pain caused her to want to faint. However, Xu Qing quickly stuffed a pill into her mouth, extending her life and preventing her from fainting.As such, she could only let out blood-curdling screams while having to endure the intense pain. Her expression also distorted. Her eyes were no longer filled with despair but were mixed with madness and viciousness. Just as she was about to speak, Xu Qing punched her mouth, directly shattering it into a bloody mess.After that, Xu Qing coldly looked at the woman and took a deep breath. With a wave of his hand, the mosasaur opened its mouth and swallowed the sea turtle in one gulp. After that, it floated in the air while Xu Qing dragged the Starfish Race's princess by her leg and walked toward the sect.The sand and gravel on the beach cut against the flesh of the Starfish Race's princess like sharp blades, causing her to suffer not only the pain of the collapse of the magic apertures in her body but also from the thousands of cuts.Her blood-curdling screeches became inhuman.Just like that, Xu Qing walked all the way. Behind him, a shocking bloody trail was left.This blood trail grew longer and longer, and the screams became weaker and weaker. Not long later, Xu Qing walked into the range of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation and saw the majestic city in the distance. He then expressionlessly spoke."Xu Qing, the director of the Seventh Peak's Homicide Department, is reporting to the sect. The Starfish Race has rebelled. I ask for the sect's array formation to suppress all the Starfish Race members in the Seven Blood Eyes. Don't let them teleport or escape. Don't let them transmit their messages to the outside world and suppress them immediately!"As soon as he finished speaking, the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation instantly rumbled, as though it was rapidly screening him. At the next instant, an aged voice rang out from the Sixth Peak and spread in all directions with hurried breathing."Permitted!"Following the voice, the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation was activated and the suppression began immediately. At the same time, several figures flew out of the Seven Blood Eyes and headed straight for Xu Qing.The fastest was Lord Sixth, who walked out of the Sixth Peak. He crossed the distance with almost a step and arrived in front of Xu Qing. His Nascent Soul cultivation made him look like the sun, emitting heat and madness that distorted everything in the surroundings."Xu Qing, what did you find out!"Xu Qing took a deep breath and endured the discomfort from the Nascent Soul energy fluctuation. He then cupped his fists and spoke in a low voice."Lord Sixth, you'll know after searching her soul!"As he spoke, Xu Qing threw the princess behind him to Lord Sixth. Lord Sixth's breathing was hurried. If it was any other peak lord, they might not search the girl's soul because of Xu Qing's words. However, he was different.Lord Sixth didn't hesitate at all. He pressed his right hand on the forehead of the Starfish Race's princess and started to search her soul!Not long later, the captain and the others also arrived. When they saw this scene, their expressions turned solemn. They waited silently beside Xu Qing. The captain looked at the Starfish Race's princess who was screaming miserably and then at the expressionless Xu Qing whose murderous aura was still dense. He patted his shoulder."Little Qing, I'll shoulder this matter with you!"

Chapter 297 Extermination Edict
Xu Qing turned his head and stared at the captain with bloodshot eyes."Little Qing, life is a unique experience. There's bitterness, sweetness, sorrow, and joy. It's not a single color, nor can it be a single color.""This is something that even the god in the sky can't change. Because we are humans and not wild beasts, so… I understand your sadness and your urge to kill.""What I want to tell you is that you can do whatever you want and follow your heart to walk in the path that belongs only to you." The captain smiled. His smile was gentle and sunny.The light from his smile entered Xu Qing's eyes and his murderous mind, stirring up a fluctuation.Xu Qing fell silent. He rarely heard such words. The last two people who talked about life with him like this were Captain Lei and Grandmaster Bai.After a long while, Xu Qing seriously glanced at the captain and nodded heavily. He then looked at Lord Sixth, who was searching the princess' soul, and waited for his answer.He only handed the princess of the Starfish Race. As for the bizarre fiend, Xu Qing didn't hand it over. He hadn't tortured it enough and it knew too much about him.Moreover, now that the mastermind had been found, the information from the princess of the Starfish Race was enough.As the soul search continued, Lord Sixth's body slowly trembled and the veins on his forehead bulged one after another. His eyes gradually turned bloodshot and his breathing became hurried. He involuntarily let out huffing sounds that seemed to be filled with extreme grief and indignation.At the next instant, Lord Sixth seemed to have seen a key memory. His entire body trembled fiercely. With a boom, the Starfish Race's princess' body exploded into blood mist. Her soul was directly extracted by Lord Sixth and thrown into his mouth as he chewed fiercely.As he chewed, the redness in his eyes increased. Without saying anything, he performed a series of hand seals and pointed at the sky. Immediately, the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation rumbled. Streams of light descended from the dome of the array formation and headed straight for the main city.The main city quaked and the ground seemed to be churning. Miserable screams echoed from various areas as one figure after another was pulled into the air by the power of the array formation.From afar, the number of those figures was about 200. They were all cultivators of the Starfish Race and there were three Golden Cores among them. At that moment, these three people's eyes were filled with panic and horror.However, no matter how they struggled, it was useless. Under the mighty power of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation, they couldn't even put up a counterattack. In an instant, they were brought before Lord Sixth.Over 200 Starfish cultivators were held in the air before Xu Qing and the others. Because they were pulled too fast, many of their bodies couldn't withstand the force and exploded. The remaining cultivators screamed and cried.Lord Sixth's eyes revealed ruthlessness. He opened his mouth and sucked fiercely. Immediately, the color of the sky changed and the wind and clouds rolled back.The cultivators in the air let out ear-piercing screams. Their bodies withered at a speed visible to the naked eye and their souls were all extracted by Lord Sixth.One could see wisps of soul shadows rapidly spreading out of the seven orifices of these Starfish Race cultivators, heading straight for Lord Sixth. Among them were the three Golden Cores' souls.To Lord Sixth, there was no difference between Golden Core, Foundation Building, and Qi Condensation!In an instant, more than 200 souls were swallowed by Lord Sixth. As he chewed and obtained more information, the blood vessels in his eyes increased. Finally, amidst the mournful cries, Lord Sixth swallowed all the souls.He closed his eyes. A few breaths later, he opened his eyes again; this time, there was a monstrous killing intent in them. He took a deep breath and looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing endured the terrifying pressure and stared at Lord Sixth."Xu Qing, this old man owes you a favor. If Old Seventh doesn't accept you as his disciple, I'll accept you as my personal disciple!"After Lord Sixth finished speaking, he took out a blue voice transmission jade slip.This jade slip was different from other jade slips Xu Qing had seen. It didn't look like it was forged from spirit jade but something even more precious. In fact, it contained an aura comparable to a Golden Core.Holding this blue jade slip, Lord Sixth calmly spoke."Old Seventh!"In reality, he did not have to speak and could simply transmit his voice through his divine sense.However, he knew that Xu Qing was the one who found out about this and also knew the reason why Xu Qing had investigated in the first place. Hence, Lord Sixth simply spoke directly so that Xu Qing would know the cause and effect of this matter."This matter has been investigated clearly. Many years ago, the Starfish Race obtained the first volume of the Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill, so they began to secretly capture the heaven's chosen of various races. They did it very secretly and have captured many of them over the years. My son was one of them.""Their main medicine has taken shape but they lack the second volume, and this resulted in the assassination of Grandmaster Bai. They should have prepared for a long time for this.""As for the Starfish Race's visit to the Seven Blood Eyes this time, they were here to secretly provide support. On the surface, this matter looks like the Starfish Race rushed into danger and did such a huge thing because of their ambitions. Whether it was the order to capture heaven's chosen back then or taking the second volume of the pill formula from Grandmaster Bai, it was all personally ordered by the Starfish Race's patriarch.""However, the Starfish Race is weak. They don't even have a Nascent Soul cultivator. Even if their ancestor is hiding his cultivation base, it's impossible for such a race to have the guts to do such a monstrous thing. It's also impossible for them to do such a thing so meticulously that I didn't notice it all these years.""There must be another secret behind this matter. What do you think?" Lord Sixth said calmly.At the side, Xu Qing's breathing was hurried. Killing intent rose in his eyes and his baleful aura spread out. He heard that the mastermind was the Starfish Race's patriarch and also heard that there was another secret to this matter.Xu Qing believed that he would find out what the secret was soon. However, his strongest thought at this moment was to kill the Starfish Race's patriarch!Just as Xu Qing's heart was filled with killing intent, Old Master Seventh's deep voice rang out from the blue jade slip in Lord Sixth's hand."The Starfish Race betrayed the alliance and should be exterminated. Moreover, it has to be done quickly. However, I can't return now…""There's no need for you to return. Help me ask the ancestor if he can let me do as I please. I've been suppressing my feelings for many years and I want to kill." The killing intent in Lord Sixth's eyes was the same as Xu Qing's and they were both unable to restrain it.There was no sound from the jade slip. After about ten breaths, a gloomy and hoarse voice suddenly rang out."Six, listen up!""Ancestor!" Lord Sixth immediately greeted respectfully. Xu Qing, the captain, and the others also lowered their heads."It's been hard on you all these years… Go and exterminate the Starfish Race!"Lord Sixth lifted his head, his eyes revealing madness. Xu Qing also lifted his head, and killing intent erupted from his eyes."I follow the decree of the ancestor!" Lord Sixth took a deep breath and looked at the distant sky. He then laughed, but the laughter was filled with endless sorrow and madness. In the end, it was almost like crying.After that, he waved his hand. Immediately, the Sixth Peak in the distance quaked and stirred up countless dust and fog. This towering mountain actually rose into the air!!An earth-shattering sound shook the surroundings. At the same time, an indescribably huge pressure spread in all directions as the entire Sixth Peak arrived.Cave abodes opened one after another on the Sixth Peak. Many Sixth Peak disciples who were in seclusion walked out one after another. There were many Golden Cores and Foundation Building cultivators among them.Although most of the Sixth Peak's disciples had gone to the war with the Sea Corpse Race, to the Sixth Peak, they didn't lack magic artifacts and puppets. Hence, at the next instant, as the terrifying mountain rumbled, puppets flew out of the mountain and spread in all directions. There were thousands of them densely packed together.After that, large-scale war magic artifacts were activated on the Sixth Peak. 𝕿𝖍𝖎𝖘 𝖈𝖍𝖆𝖕𝖙𝖊𝖗 𝖚𝖕𝖑𝖔𝖆𝖉 𝖋𝖎𝖗𝖘𝖙 𝖆𝖙 𝖓𝖔𝖛𝖊𝖑-𝖇𝖎𝖓.𝖈𝖔𝖒  The incomparably huge Sixth Peak in the sky shone with boundless light and emitted a monstrous aura. The pressure even caused the sky to change color. It floated in the sky like a terrifying and vast war fortress!Lord Sixth took a step forward and headed straight for this war fortress. As he got closer, the entire Sixth Peak trembled. The thousands of puppets in the surroundings and the Golden Core and Foundation Building disciples guarding the peak knelt down one after another."Greetings, Peak Lord!"Their voices spread in all directions like a flood.Xu Qing's heart also trembled. The captain at the side also widened his eyes and muttered in a low voice."The old man said that the Sixth Martial Uncle was a heaven's chosen who was on par with him back then. It's just that he spent these few years in sadness and he didn't have the mood to cultivate… This is called not having the mood to cultivate? He f*cking refined the entire Sixth Peak. This is unprecedented. He didn't use this much effort even when fighting the Sea Corpse Race."In the sky, Lord Sixth stopped in his tracks and lowered his head to coldly glance at the captain. The captain shrunk his head and Lord Sixth's gaze shifted to Xu Qing. His expression softened."Xu Qing, this is for you." As he spoke, he picked up the wine gourd that he had been carrying around all year round. With a gentle shake, a blue light flew out and headed straight for Xu Qing. After it arrived, it transformed into a blue gem pendant that floated in front of Xu Qing.This gem pendant emitted a resplendent light that contained an astonishing defense. Xu Qing felt that this defense was infinitely majestic, causing his mind to be in turmoil."Nascent Soul protection!!" The captain's eyes were wide open as he exclaimed. His eyes revealed intense envy as he eagerly looked at Lord Sixth in the sky."Also, Xu Qing, go bring the ancestor's calligraphy. The ancestor's words contain divine power. You hold the ancestor's words and have my protection. Follow me to the Starfish Race and kill to your heart's content!!""The two of us will vent the pent-up emotions in our hearts!" Lord Sixth took a deep breath. After saying that, he headed straight for the Sixth Peak and stepped on it.Xu Qing nodded heavily. The killing intent built up in his body was extremely dense. He wanted to kill, kill all the Starfish Race members in sight, kill the Starfish Race's patriarch, and kill till blood flowed into rivers.Otherwise, it would be difficult for the pent-up emotions in his heart to dissipate.Otherwise, there wouldn't be enough people to accompany his teacher in death!"I obey Lord Sixth's decree!" Xu Qing cupped his fists and headed straight for the port. When he arrived at the museum, under the greeting nods of the two Golden Core elders inside, he took down the set of words the ancestor had sent and turned to head straight for the Sixth Peak.Finally, together with the captain who was waiting for him there, the two of them stepped onto the Sixth Peak. As the huge mountain peak in the sky rumbled again, the entire world distorted.The Sixth Peak tore through the air and headed straight for the Forbidden Sea.The mountain blurred and the whole mountain teleported!Toward the Starfish Race!

Chapter 298 Inferno Of Fury
The whole of Sixth Peak had long been refined by Lord Sixth and turned into a strategic fortress.Other than him, no one knew how many magic artifacts existed on this Sixth Peak and what shocking might they could display.This was the first time this war fortress was mobilized.Although it had yet to fully display its might, just the teleportation at sea was enough to cause waves in everyone's minds.This teleportation was not a simple teleportation. Being able to teleport the entire mountain was enough to display the astonishing powers this war fortress contained.At the next instant, this huge mountain appeared in the sky above the Forbidden Sea and sped forward. Wherever it passed, the sea below churned and spread. Countless sea beasts trembled at the bottom of the sea, not daring to approach the surface of the sea.The surrounding merchant ships swayed like leaves on the sea. When the cultivators on the ships saw the huge mountain moving above them, 'shock' wasn't enough to describe what they were feeling.Xu Qing was the same. Even the captain couldn't calm down. His eyes were red as he looked left and right.In front of the two of them was Lord Sixth, who was holding the wine gourd and looking into the distance.His expression was gloomy and there seemed to be bloody intent rising in his body. The intensity of his killing intent even affected the sky, causing thunder to rumble in the sky as the Sixth Peak moved forward. Bolts of lightning exploded in the surroundings like silver snakes."The Starfish Race is a small race. Not to mention the strength of our Seven Blood Eyes, it can't even compare to the Merfolk Race. There are only seven Golden Core cultivators in the sect. Now, three have died and there are only four left," Lord Sixth calmly said."The strongest, the Starfish Ancestor, is at the great circle of the Golden Core Realm. However, I suspect that he has broken through long ago and has been hiding his cultivation base. Other than him, the other three Golden Core Realm cultivators are all at the early stage.""These early stage Golden Cores also include the patriarch of the Starfish Race. He was only able to become the patriarch because he is the Starfish ancestor's son.""This is just a small race. For such a small race to have the guts to provoke the Seven Blood Eyes and other races, no matter how I look at it, something is fishy.""Therefore, Xu Qing, you have to be more cautious in this battle. The Starfish Race… might have some great secrets," Lord Sixth said calmly.Xu Qing nodded silently.The captain didn't speak. Taking advantage of the fact that Xu Qing and Lord Sixth weren't paying attention to him, he took a few steps back and touched the rocks on the ground. The light in his eyes grew even stronger. Clearly… he liked this treasure very much.However, before the captain could check for too long, the Sixth Peak buzzed again. Lightning flashed, thunder rumbled, and stars moved. The entire mountain teleported again. This time… it directly appeared in the air above the Starfish Race.The Starfish Race was located between the Seven Blood Eyes and the merfolk islands. They only had one island as their territory and it had the shape of a huge starfish if looked from above, but it had been confirmed that its appearance was a result of modification by the Starfish Race. There wasn't really such a huge starfish resting here.There were five main cities on the island. Most of the buildings were built from corals. The greatest characteristic was that there were countless coral trees growing on the islands!This was a type of tree that looked like a coral. Each of them was very tall and emitted five-colored light at night, while during the day, they were gray and dim.Many buildings were built on these huge coral trees. There were about a hundred thousand members in the Starfish Race. Because of the protection of the Seven Blood Eyes, they didn't face much turmoil over the years and looked quite prosperous.The appearance of the Sixth Peak immediately attracted the attention of the Starfish Race. Although they didn't recognize this huge huge war fortress, the experts in the race sensed the fluctuations of the Seven Blood Eyes' cultivation art.As such, almost the instant the Sixth Peak's mountain appeared, a divine sense spread out from the Starfish Race."Is it the Seven Blood Eyes? I wonder which senior has graced our land. Please forgive me for my negligence." Following the divine sense, an old man in a five-colored Daoist robe appeared.This old man was all smiles, and it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He rose into the air and cupped his fists toward the Sixth Peak.However, what responded to him was Lord Sixth's monstrous killing intent transformed into a finger.As his finger landed, the incomparably huge mountain of the Sixth Peak pressed down fiercely on the Starfish Race below like a stamp.Under this pressure, the world rumbled and the void shattered. A tremendous pressure descended on the Starfish Race, causing cracks to appear on all the mountain peaks of the Starfish Race's island. After that, they shattered and exploded.Even the ground was the same; many areas collapsed and caved in.The Starfish Race's ancestor's expression changed intensely."Lord Sixth, what are you doing!""What am I doing? You tell me what I am doing!!" Lord Sixth couldn't suppress the killing intent in his heart anymore. His body stepped into the air and directly arrived in front of the Starfish Race's ancestor. He then grabbed fiercely.The sky darkened, the sun and moon lost their light, and the void shattered!The Starfish Race's ancestor couldn't dodge and his head was directly grabbed by Lord Sixth. As Lord Sixth ruthlessly squeezed, his body exploded.However, as it exploded, a blood shadow in the shape of a starfish flew out and reformed its body in the distance. It spat out a mouthful of blood and rapidly retreated, its eyes revealing horror."Sixth Master, is there a misunderstanding?!"Lord Sixth coldly looked at the Starfish Race's ancestor who had gathered again."As expected, you hid your cultivation base and have already broken through to the Nascent Soul realm. However, it's fine. Only then will it be interesting… You made me suffer the pain of losing my son for so many years. I have to let you have a taste of the pain of your race, your territory, and everything of yours being destroyed in front of you."As Lord Sixth spoke, he lifted his right hand and performed a series of hand seals before pressing down.Immediately, the mountain of the Sixth Peak rapidly descended toward the Starfish Race island below.It didn't land completely but stopped about ten thousand feet in the air. Blue flames emitted from the mountain and instantly covered the entire island.From afar, the blue flames flowed like heavenly fire, enveloping the surroundings. It was also like a meteor falling to the ground, rumbling in the surroundings, causing the seawater to rise under the high temperature, causing countless buildings on the Starfish Race to instantly burn. Miserable cries rang out from everywhere."Refine!""I'll refine your race, your territory, and all your bloodline. I'll refine your Starfish Race alive and refine it into a candle that will be lit in front of my son's grave day and night!!"Lord Sixth spoke with madness. With a wave of his hand, rows of war artifacts appeared on the Sixth Peak and erupted in unison, forming beams of light that headed straight for the Starfish Race.There were also the puppets. All of them emitted intense killing intent as they rushed toward the Starfish Race and started killing.There were also the disciples and elders of the Sixth Peak who descended one after another.The Starfish Race's ancestor's expression turned gloomy. He was about to stop them, but at the next instant, Lord Sixth arrived before him.The Starfish Race's ancestor spat out another mouthful of blood. His eyes turned red and a silver line quickly flashed in his pupils. His aura soared and a vast storm formed outside his body, but Lord Sixth still suppressed him.At the same time, Xu Qing and the captain also leaped and headed straight for the ground.Xu Qing landed on a coral tree.The gray coral tree couldn't withstand the impact and collapsed. Xu Qing's eyes were bloodshot and the killing intent he had suppressed until now couldn't be suppressed anymore. He rushed toward the Starfish Race members.The captain didn't participate in the fight. After he landed, he silently followed Xu Qing. This was because he knew that the hostility in Xu Qing's heart was extremely heavy now. This hostility required a large amount of blood and killing to resolve.To him, the Starfish Race wasn't important. Regardless of whether it was Old Master Seventh's secret instructions to him or his friendship with Xu Qing, they all made him hope that Xu Qing would recover as soon as possible.Hence, he only had one goal for following him this time around, and that was… to accompany him."Kill, Junior Brother. In this chaotic world, killing is the only outlet. That was how I got through back then. If we don't destroy a few races, how can we make others revere us?" The captain muttered with madness in his eyes.As for Xu Qing, he had already started killing.The life fires in Xu Qing's body were ignited and the black iron stick outside his body was in a battle-ready stance. It would attack whoever Xu Qing's gaze landed on. For a moment, rumbling sounds filled the island. Xu Qing's attacks were swift and deadly. In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of a Foundation Building cultivator of the Starfish Race.Before the other party could react, Xu Qing had already ruthlessly collided with him. The Foundation Building cultivator's body exploded into pieces immediately.In his flesh and blood, there were some thread-like silver worms. At that moment, they were twisting in the flesh and withering as the Starfish Race cultivator died.Xu Qing swept his gaze over and headed straight for the ancestral temple of the Starfish Race in the distance. That was the place where the Starfish Race's patriarch usually meditated and refined pills.On the way here, Lord Sixth had told him all the information he had obtained from searching the souls. Their division of labor was clear. Lord Sixth wanted to take revenge on the Starfish Race's ancestor and refine the entire Starfish Race, while Xu Qing's target was the patriarch because it was the other party who had given the order to assassinate Grandmaster Bai.A continent seemed to be burning in Xu Qing's body as he sped toward the Starfish Race's ancestral temple.Wherever he passed, as the blue flames fell from the sky, all the buildings were burned. Countless members of the Starfish Race let out mournful and shrill cries in the flames.Under the high temperature, even the ground melted at a speed visible to the naked eye. Many depressions were filled with blue flames, as though they wanted to seep into the soil and refine it to a deeper level.There were also puppets from the Sixth Peak that carried Lord Sixth's will, and started killing everywhere. The Sixth Peak's disciples were the same and carried out Lord Sixth's orders.The entire Starfish Race was in chaos. Coral trees collapsed one after another and the pits formed in the ground. Three of the five main cities were now covered in a dense blue sea of fire.Xu Qing instantly approached a Starfish Race cultivator who was about to stop him and waved his hand. The Golden Crow let out a cry and in an instant, the cultivator turned into a corpse.Xu Qing didn't slow down. The Golden Crow followed behind him with its tail flames dragging behind like a cloak. A large amount of black fog also appeared around Xu Qing, forming a sinister face in the air. Inside were densely-packed little black bugs.The shadow and the black iron stick were also closely following behind.From afar, Xu Qing looked like a baleful god had descended into the world. Wherever he passed, all the obstructions would die!!
