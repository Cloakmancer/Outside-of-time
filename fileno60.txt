Under the twilight, the youth's figure caused Fire Crow's heart to be shaken.He was a well-experienced scavenger. If it was a newbie in his shoes, they'd definitely be shocked despite the fact that their cultivation level clearly surpassed the other party.Even he felt shaken, but that was quickly suppressed by the viciousness and fury of being injured. At this moment, his eyes revealed intense killing intent."B*stard, I'll pluck out your teeth one by one as my spoils of war."As Fire Crow spoke out in a deep voice, he tugged off his clothes and revealed a skinny upper body.Not paying any heed to the injury to his ear and chest, he performed a set of mudras with both hands. When his face flushed red, a fireball that was even larger than the ones earlier suddenly appeared.Upon seeing this, Xu Qing's eyes narrowed and he abruptly moved."Scatter!" Fire Crow let out a low bellow and the big fireball in his hand split into five smaller fireballs that headed straight for Xu Qing.After that, explosive sounds instantly resounded and flames covered the ground. Amidst all the burning, Xu Qing's figure dashed out once again. He launched two consecutive punches as he did before to shatter the barrier.Although his body would inadvertently be pushed back from the impact, in addition to suffering burns from the high-temperature flames, his speed didn't reduce at all. His killing intent also didn't slacken in the slightest.Just like that, using such a method that ignored his own injuries, he started a fierce battle in the jungle against Fire Crow.The battle became increasingly intense.It was true that Xu Qing wasn't a match for Fire Crow.Regardless of whether it was the spirit energy barrier or the fireballs, they were all very disadvantageous for Xu Qing. The former made it hard for him to perform close-range attacks, while the latter posed an extremely great threat to him.However, Xu Qing's recovery ability was astonishing, and it allowed him to quickly recover after he got injured. His injuries didn't affect his battle prowess.Besides, his stamina was as abundant as at the start of the fight. Although the prolonged pain from his body would form a mental torment, he, who grew up in the slums, had nurtured a tolerance that surpassed that of ordinary people.The most important thing was... the spirit energy that contained a high density of anomalous substances didn't have any influence on Xu Qing at all. However, to Fire Crow, it was completely different.It was still fine for the ear's injury, but the injury on his chest became increasingly aggravated. The most important thing was his spirit energy...Even though his cultivation base was at the fifth level of Qi Condensation, he was unable to withstand such a depletion. Hence, he could only passively absorb spirit energy to replenish his consumption.Moreover, the pressure Xu Qing brought him in the intense battle caused him to have no time to catch a breath at all. With that, the amount of anomalous substances in his body kept surging and accumulating.Very soon, the anger that Fire Crow felt in the beginning transformed into nervousness. In the end, anxiety actually appeared on his face.He had noticed that something was amiss with his body and that there was a problem with this young man!Anyone else at the third level of Qi Condensation, or even at the fifth level, wouldn't have been able to hang on for so long in the face of such fireball attacks. They would have turned into dried corpses long ago.He felt that even if he was in Xu Qing's shoes, he wouldn't be able to do what he did.However, this youth in front of him, despite his injuries increasing and looking serious, his speed and power didn't diminish in the least.This made the unsettled feelings in Fire Crow's heart grow increasingly intense.At this moment, the anomalous substances in Fire Crow's body kept on increasing, and he was getting close to mutation. This caused his breathing to become even more anxious. "Fire Crow, you trash! Hurry up and end the battle!!"In the far distance, the Bloodshadow Team Captain who was fighting Captain Lei had no choice but to be distracted as he spared some attention to the situation here. When he looked at this scene right now, he roared angrily.He wanted to help, but Captain Lei suddenly exploded forth with attacks to obstruct him, making it hard for him to leave. Right now, he could only feel anxious.Moreover, Captain Lei could already tell that Xu Qing's battle plan was to drag out the battle until Fire Crow mutated.Although he didn't know why Xu Qing was confident nor why he was able to perform as usual amidst his injuries and pain, everyone had their own secrets. Captain Lei understood this point. He had his own secrets too.Therefore, he had no intention to probe further. What he could do was to not allow the Bloodshadow Team Captain before him to go over to help.The battle continued.Fire Crow cast three other fireballs but was still helpless against Xu Qing. Hence, he, who was already anxious, now that he was scolded by his captain, the negative emotions in his heart completely erupted and turned into craziness.He abruptly raised his right hand and hammered his chest, spurting out a large mouthful of blood. After that, he quickly swung his left hand and caught some of the blood before the droplets fell onto the ground.As he chanted an incantation, the blood in his hand quickly turned black.At the sight of this, Xu Qing's eyes contracted and he felt an even more intense sense of crisis. He charged out and wanted to disrupt the other party's spell.However, this time around, Fire Crow's spell was cast extremely fast. At the instant Xu Qing moved, Fire Crow lifted his head abruptly and his expression became distorted. His gaze then flashed with cruelty as he waved his right hand.The black blood in his hand instantly swelled up to form a ball of blood that was the size of a human head.It seemed to be bubbling inside, and it flew toward Xu Qing with astonishing power."Die!" Fire Crow let out a low and sinister bellow.Perhaps because the spell this time was too exhausting and the anomalous substances in his body continued to increase, his legs were trembling weakly at this moment.On the other hand, the killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes abruptly intensified. Just like Captain Lei had thought, he was indeed prepared to drag out the battle until the other party mutated. However, it wasn't exactly correct either. Xu Qing had never given up on the thought of killing his opponent in his process of mutation. p1ease visi(t) nove1B(in).ne)t  Although he was no longer holding onto the dagger and iron stick, he still kept on looking for an opportunity to deal the killing blow.This chance finally appeared now when Fire Crow showed his fragility.Almost at the instant the black-colored ball of blood fired over, Xu Qing's advancing figure hastened his speed.He didn't dash toward Fire Crow in a straight line but shifted his direction slightly to where Barbaric Ghost's corpse was at.Barbaric Ghost's corpse was covered in burn marks from Fire Crow's large area of effect fireball attacks. But in this place, other than the corpses, there were also... Barbaric Ghost's weapons!Footnote:[1] A line from a poem by Li Shang.

Chapter 32 You Asked When I Shall Return, I Have No Idea (2)
There was a mace and two pieces of broken finesteel shield.However, Xu Qing's target was the bigger piece of the broken shield.His figure instantly got close, and he grabbed the heavy finesteel shield. After that, with his small and skinny body covered by the shield, he charged out instantly, heading straight for Fire Crow who was behind the black blood ball.A moment later, an explosive sound echoed out as Fire Crow's blood ball came into contact with Xu Qing, smashing onto the shield before transforming into endless jets of black blood that shot out.That finesteel shield also couldn't withstand the attack, instantly fragmenting. However, it still withstood most of the impact.This caused Xu Qing, who was behind the shield, to not suffer from a lethal attack despite being hit by some of the black blood. At this moment, he clenched his teeth tightly and didn't slow down, showing no hesitation at all as he sped forth like an arrow, closing onto Fire Crowd.Fire Crow's gaze revealed a look of mockery, and he didn't plan on dodging at all. As he performed a set of mudras with both hands, the scattered black blood behind Xu Qing quickly rose from the ground into the air. It seemed that it wouldn't be long before the blood would all levitate and transform into blood arrows that fired urgently at Xu Qing.All of this left Xu Qing with nowhere else to dodge, but he wasn't planning on dodging either.​ As he got close, his left hand clenched into a fist, but the punch being thrown out was done by his right hand instead.As a result, cracks appeared on the spirit energy barrier outside Fire Crow's body, and the inner part of Xu Qing's right fist became bloodied. Amidst the blood, there were also scaled pierces of flesh.Before Fire Crow could see clearly, Xu Qing's eyes turned bloodshot as he unleashed a second punch.With a bang, the barrier broke down into pieces and the tremendous impact wave spread out, pushing back Xu Qing's body. This was like what had happened previously, and he couldn't get close at all as the impact waves forced him back.The mockery in Fire Crow's eyes grew. However, at this moment...Xu Qing's body seemed to gain additional strength from nowhere.Amidst the impact from the shattering barrier, Xu Qing wasn't pushed back as he was previously.He charged out fiercely and withstood the pressure, stretching out his right hand as he fiercely grabbed at the bloody part of Fire Crow's chest, where the iron stick had pierced through previously.However, it was like the additional strength only allowed him to have enough energy to make this grab. Although he tore open Fire Crow's injury, he was unable to deal a lethal blow and could only choose to retreat rapidly at this moment.Fire Crow's countenance changed and he stumbled backward.After he discovered that Xu Qing's grab wasn't too much of a threat to him, he let out a sinister laugh and wanted to cast a spell to shoot the black blood.However, at the next instant, his countenance changed once again and he lowered his head abruptly.At the bloody part where his chest was... there were some shards of broken fangs as well as mushy flesh with scales on them.Right now, the flesh part of the injury corroded, and venomous blood flowed out. Wherever they passed by, his skin would rot rapidly.Unbearable pain gushed forth intensely at this moment, causing Fire Crow to let out an agonizing cry. A look of unprecedented terror appeared on his face.He then retreated unceasingly and saw Xu Qing crouching in the far distance. The latter opened up his right palm and threw out some broken pieces of flesh and crushed fangs that looked similar to the one on him.If one pieced these broken pieces of flesh and crushed fangs together, they'd form the shape of a snake head. It was the venomous snake head Xu Qing had used to deal with the corpses.Moreover, his left hand was shivering slightly and slowly opening up. As the shattered amber pieces fell, it revealed the ghostface scorpion's tail that pierced deeply into his palm!The former let his palm contain intense venom, while the latter caused him to have the additional strength to attack despite facing the barrier's impact!"You..." Fire Crow trembled, unable to say a word amidst his howls, let alone cast a spell.His gaze revealed intense dread in the face of death, and he struggled to wipe off the venomous blood on him. However, a tremendous amount of venomous blood gushed out, causing his stamina and vitality to seep rapidly.Xu Qing took a deep breath. The recovery effect shown by the purple crystal in his fight with Fat Mountain allowed him to know that he could neutralize poison.His right hand, which had been tainted by the snake venom, didn't corrode. This made everything clear.This was the killing blow he had prepared for use against Fire Crow.Right now, he stood up and ran straight for Fire Crow.After that, the horror in Fire Crow's gaze turned into despair as Xu Qing got closer. He struggled and retreated as he wailed in agony."Captain, save me!"This tragic scene caused the eyes of the Bloodshadow Team Captain, who was currently fighting with Captain Lei, to open wide. He wanted to go and save Fire Crow, but Captain Lei's attacks kept obstructing him, making it hard for him to go over. p1ease visi(t) nove1B(in).ne)t  He could only watch as Xu Qing's figure rapidly closed in on Fire Crow.As Xu Qing moved closer, Fire Crow's injuries and the breakdown of his mental state caused the dense anomalous substances that had accumulated in his body to not be suppressed any longer.Before Xu Qing completely got close, Fire Crow's body stiffened up fiercely amidst his despair. After that, anomalous substances spread out in his entire body and with an explosive bang... he turned into blood mistSome people left behind greenish-black corpses when they mutated, while others exploded into blood mist.Xu Qing halted his steps and looked at the spot where Fire Crow had turned into blood mist. After that, he turned and looked coldly at the Bloodshadow Team Captain.The sun was setting, but the dusk in the sky was different compared to the past. The dark night didn't come, but instead, the sky had a strange red glow covering it.Under this redness, Xu Qing's figure was also dyed red. He stood there, covered in wounds, and his cold and sharp gaze emitted an indescribable pressure.This pressure caused the mentality of the Bloodshadow Team Captain, whose cultivation surpassed his, to tremble intensely.Fire Crow's death was too tragic and this dealt an extremely great blow to the Bloodshadow Team Captain's inner heart.He had failed to take down Captain Lei despite fighting for a long time, and in addition to how bizarre Xu Qing was, all of these factors caused the Bloodshadow Team Captain to feel great unease. At this moment, his gaze flickered, and the instant when Xu Qing glanced over, he blasted back Captain Lei with a punch and rapidly retreated with no hesitation.He didn't wish to continue with the fight any longer.

Chapter 33 You Asked When I Shall Return, I Have No Idea (3)
 Captain Lei wanted to pursue, but when he raised his head and saw that smear of strange redness in the sky, his expression suddenly changed. His emotions then fluctuated, and he coughed out fresh blood as his body turned increasingly greenish-black. Clearly, he was on the verge of collapse.Xu Qing approached hastily and supported Captain Lei.As Captain Lei was panting, Xu Qing sat him under a large tree and looked up into the distant jungle where the Bloodshadow Team Captain was speeding away. His eyes flashed with murderous intent."You're alone, don't pursue him. With the Bloodshadow Team destroyed, he cannot amount to anything. In addition, this redness in the sky… I think I have seen it before…"Captain Lei grabbed onto Xu Qing as he looked up and stared unwaveringly at the blue dome of the sky."He's a lurking peril," Xu Qing said slowly.He didn't like any type of hidden perils and within this jungle of the forbidden zone, Xu Qing felt confident. Like how he had dragged Fire Crow to death, he would drag this Bloodshadow Captain to his death as well. However, he instinctively looked up at the blue dome upon hearing Captain Lei's words. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  At that moment…A wave of faint and ethereal-sounding singing drifted from within this jungle.All of the mutated beasts' roars in the forbidden zone's jungle disappeared at this instant.In the silent jungle, the singing became clearer.It sounded as though a woman was holding a hidden bitterness about her husband's departure. Following the reverberations, waves of faint red mist appeared from where the Bloodshadow Captain had sped toward.It swept up everything in the surroundings and filled the air.Xu Qing's body trembled suddenly. Captain Lei, who was sitting below the large tree, also shuddered in that instant. Both of them instantly looked toward the origin of the singing voice.It was just that the former was incomparably vigilant, while the latter… seemed to be in a trance.The singing continued to drift endlessly and when the voice entered Xu Qing's ears, it caused an indescribable coldness to fill his body. It felt as though he was under the icy blood rain in the ruined city from before.Even though he was currently at the third level of Body Refinement, he still couldn't handle it. His teeth started chattering and he lost the mobility of his body.Xu Qing's mind was in a rumble. He couldn't help but recall what Cross had said about the forbidden zone's taboos when they first entered.At the place they were staring at, the Bloodshadow Captain stopped as well. His body was shivering uncontrollably.It was as if there was something invisible approaching him at the moment, causing him to lose all strength to escape.Xu Qing personally saw wisps of white mist flowing out of the shivering Bloodshadow Captain's seven apertures, blending into the blood fog that pervaded the air.And in this process, the Bloodshadow Captain's body swiftly withered and decayed until it turned into a dried corpse and shattered into dust.The fog covered the ground where it was and started spreading through the air toward Xu Qing and Captain Lei.With the nearing of the fog, Xu Qing's body trembled. Finally, he saw the cause of the Bloodshadow Captain's death. It was… a pair of bright red woman's boots, and they looked very tattered."This is…" Xu Qing panted and his eyes were wide open. He saw the pair of boots appearing in front of the distant fog, moving on its own on the soil and walking toward them step by step.There was nothing above the boots… Only the singing voice with hidden bitterness, coming closer and closer.It was as though there was an invisible body of a woman wearing this pair of red boots, singing as she walked over.The voice became increasingly clear. The blood-colored boots walking on the soil were heading toward Xu Qing.This strange scene made Xu Qing's pupils constrict intensely. His body wanted to move, but it couldn't do so.It was as if the cold had frozen his entire being, making even his teeth rattle. He could only watch helplessly as the pair of blood-colored boots stepped closer until it was half a zhang away from him…The threat of death covered all of Xu Qing's emotions in that instant. He wanted to step back, but he was powerless. Only the large amount of blood veins appearing in his eyes divulged his violent struggle at that moment.Just when the pair of blood-red boots was about to take another step nearer to him, at that very moment… A trembling voice drifted over from beside Xu Qing. It was Captain Lei."Red Peach… Is that you…" The voice was hoarse and trembling with a hint of uncertainty.At that moment he spoke these words, the strange singing came to an abrupt stop.At the side, the boot that was lifted in the air stopped for a moment before changing direction unexpectedly. It was like the woman who was standing there had turned her body at that moment and looked at Captain Lei.Upon seeing this scene, Captain Lei's body trembled, and his breathing became unprecedentedly hurried. But at that moment, his exhausted body burst forth with leftover energy. There was an unprecedented glimmer in his eyes as he stared unwaveringly at the space above the pair of boots. It was as if in his eyes, he could see someone incomparably important to him, a woman that was as important as his own life, standing there.She was separated from him by a void, by the world, by yin and yang, as they looked at each other.The strong Captain Lei had tears falling uncontrollably at that moment."You… Have you returned…" His trembling body lifted a hand, as though he wanted to grab something. That pair of red boots slowly lifted as well and walked up to Captain Lei. They then bent over slightly.The invisible woman seemed to have squatted down gently in front of Captain Lei's body, letting his trembling hand touch her face.However, Captain Lei's hand swept across the void and couldn't touch anything. As his efforts proved futile, his tears… fell even more.Only his murmurings existed, basking in this desolate sadness.After a long time, it was as though the sound of the woman's soft sigh came from nothingness. That pair of red boots then slowly straightened and gradually stepped back.It only adjusted its direction after it had retreated by three zhangs. It bypassed Xu Qing and walked into the distance with the red fog following.…"You asked when I shall return, I have no idea.Asking about a return date which seems uncertain.The fog hid the cruelty of the situation and the fog of singing distanced itself."…The singing continued. With the hidden bitterness, the voice seemed to be filled with more agony and melancholy as it walked further away.Not only so, but the blood-colored fog also bypassed them. It seemed as though it was roiling and floated toward the distance.Only when the singing voice became weaker did the fog disappear completely. The voice then slowly dissipated as well.Xu Qing's body finally regained its mobility. He panted heavily and his eyes were filled with horror. The first thing he did was to turn around and look at Captain Lei who sat there.At that moment, Captain Lei was staring blankly into the distance. There was a dazed look in his eyes, and the tears still continued flowing silently.Xu Qing was silent. Whatever he wanted to ask, he couldn't get it out at that moment.After a long time, Captain Lei mumbled softly."Do you find it strange?"Xu Qing nodded quietly."Before, Cross told you that I'm one of the few who have heard that singing voice." Captain Lei looked into the distance and spoke slowly in a low voice."Do you know that the singing voice in this forbidden zone is really strange? Most of the people who heard it had died and only very few could survive."But if the person was able to survive it, then they would receive a 'gift' from this forbidden zone. The next time the person hears this singing voice, it will let them… see the person they miss the most in their entire life."I originally thought this was just a legend, and it was because of this legend that I've waited silently at the campsite for decades until my hair turned white…"And today, I finally saw it."When Captain Lei spoke to this point, his entire being seemed to age by a lot. The wrinkles on his face stacked, and there was a sense of fragility emanating from his body."Do you also have someone separated by yin and yang*, and have someone you want to see… If you do, then don't learn from me, don't wait here…"Even if you see them, it's still futile in the end…" Captain Lei muttered bitterly. He closed his eyes, and the tears streamed down the folds of his face ceaselessly, dripping on his lapels.Xu Qing was silent. He lifted his head toward the place where the voice disappeared to. In the depths of his eyes, recollection of his memory gradually emerged.There was someone he wanted to see too.Someone he really, really missed.[1] The yin and yang here refers to the separation between the yang realm (mortal world) and the yin realm (underworld)

Chapter 34 What Are You Exactly? (1)
Perhaps it was because of the singing voice, but within this jungle of the forbidden zone, the howling of the mutated beasts still didn't appear. It was as though the source of the singing voice was this forbidden zone's ruler. After its appearance, everything had to be silent.Captain Lei sat there quietly, still watching the faraway place. It was pitch-black and there was nothing there.Xu Qing had a complicated expression on his face. After a while, he swept his gaze across his surroundings, and it ultimately landed on Barbaric Ghost's mace and shattered shield fragments.Barbaric Ghost's corpse, like all the other corpses here, had turned into dust when the singing fog departed. It was as though they never existed in this world.And in many cases, scavengers didn't have many relatives. Hence, there might not be many who cared about their disappearance.Even if there were, they would eventually be forgotten with the passage of time. Thousands of years later… nobody would know or remember.Xu Qing suddenly thought of the teacher who had treated him rather well back in the slums. During his latter days, before he died of sickness, he said something to a bunch of children."To have someone you can't forget is a kind of suffering, but to be remembered by someone else is a type of blessing."Xu Qing didn't understand it at that time, but as he watched Captain Lei now, he could somewhat understand the meaning behind it. Hence, he didn't interrupt but walked quietly to the area where Barbaric Ghost's corpse had been previously. He then took his dagger and began digging the ground.Even if he didn't have a close relationship with Barbaric Ghost, or more accurately, they only knew each other for days and didn't speak much to each other, the other party still imparted his knowledge of the jungle to him. They had also fought and walked out of the life and death crisis against those wolves together. Ultimately, it was with the help of Barbaric Ghost's item that Xu Qing had stopped the black blood.So, Xu Qing thought he should do something.Just like how he had cremated the corpses of the entire city before he left the ruined city, he diligently dug a hole in the earth and deepened it into a pit eventually.He then buried the Barbaric Ghost's mace and shattered pieces of the shield. novel online free at ｎｏｖｅｌｂｉｎ  During the process, Xu Qing was very serious. He didn't notice that Captain Lei had retracted his gaze toward the jungle and was now watching him from behind.There was a hint of astonishment on his face, just like when he first saw Xu Qing in the ruined city previously. When he saw Xu Qing burying Barbaric Ghost's weapons and looked like he wanted to make a tombstone, Captain Lei spoke up."Scavengers don't need tombstones."Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. This is the life of a scavenger. While living, they struggled with the world, and after death… there was no need to offer sacrifice either. Peace would suffice."As Captain Lei said this, his breathing got weaker. With the serious injuries, the accumulation of anomalous substances, and the exhaustion of his mind, he was unable to hold on any longer. Gradually, the world turned fuzzy and he lost consciousness.Xu Qing stepped closer and took out some of the seven-leaf grass from his pocket before stuffing it into Captain Lei's mouth.He didn't know if it would be useful but thought that since the item was a necessary ingredient to make the white pills, it should have some effects in alleviating anomalous substances.After that, he carried Captain Lei on his back and used the clothes to tie them tightly together. Only then did he take a deep breath. In the night, he traversed the jungle at full speed.When he went past the spot where the Bloodshadow Captain had turned to dust, Xu Qing spotted a leather bag. He picked it up but didn't see any medicinal pills inside, only various miscellaneous items. As such, he took it and instantly sped away.When the weak Captain Lei regained his consciousness, an hour had already passed.He could vaguely feel himself being carried by a small body. With the motion of the movement, he slowly opened his eyes and saw the side of the youth's face in front of him.He fell silent.Xu Qing probably sensed that Captain Lei had awakened. Softly, he started to speak."Are you feeling better? There are a few hours to go, so you can continue sleeping. We should be able to get out of the forbidden zone before daybreak."Captain Lei didn't say anything. His frail body wasn't able to mask his old age. He tried to lift his head to see the pitch-black sky, but his vision slowly grew fuzzy. Just as he sensed that he was about to pass out again, he muttered."Kid, do you know why I proposed to take you away twice in that ruined city?"Xu Qing's body didn't stop moving. He shook his head."Then, do you remember the scene when we first met?" Captain Lei's voice was a little weak."I remember." Xu Qing's body moved and he leaped over a huge tree. After that, he lifted his right hand and grabbed the area next to him, capturing a mutated lizard that hid there and was rushing at them at great speed. Seizing the opportunity, he threw it toward the ground ahead.With the bang, following the lizard's descent, a large number of vines on the ground twisted and swiftly twined around it. During the struggle of the lizard, its leathery armor was punctured and its flesh was devoured.Xu Qing took this opportunity to leap up and avoid the danger before proceeding further ahead.At that moment, the mumbling of Captain Lei behind him was weak. Even with their close distance, it was difficult to hear him."I saw the silhouette of you cremating the corpses. At that time, the fire illuminated you while you were standing beside the blaze. You looked like you had fused with the fire. It made me feel as though I have seen… a trace of warmth in this cruel world."Xu Qing's footsteps then stopped in his tracks and he fell silent. At this moment, Captain Lei fell into unconsciousness once more.After a few breaths, Xu Qing quietly lifted his feet and continued speeding through the jungle, traversing past trees rapidly.Time went by and very soon, two hours passed.Xu Qing avoided all danger, and the distance toward the boundary of the jungle became shorter and shorter.At this moment, when the sky was at its darkest, the gloomy cold from the forbidden zone invaded the surroundings. Fortunately, Xu Qing was moving rapidly and the heat generated by his body instinctively resisted the cold slightly.However, as he moved forward, the cold became increasingly intense. After the amount of time it took for an incense stick to burn out, Xu Qing stopped abruptly. His expression was somber as he looked ahead.

Chapter 35 What Are You Exactly? (2)
In front of him, fog emerged from the jungle.The fog was extremely thick and had spread out into the distance. However, it wasn't the same as the blood fog Xu Qing had seen before. The sense of oppression didn't seem too intense.It was just that, as far as the eyes could see, everything within the area that was shrouded by the fog was blurry. It was impossible for Xu Qing to see anything in the surroundings clearly.Especially since it was currently dark, it made the cover of the fog even more intense. Xu Qing wanted to avoid it, but after running for a long time, he saw that the fog was still approaching.He knew what this was.Cross and Luan Tooth had mentioned this when they just entered the forbidden zone. This was one of the dangers within; it was a type of fog known as the labyrinth fog.When engulfed by this fog, a person would lose their sense of direction and ultimately lose their way.And once the fog formed, it would usually take a long time for it to disperse on its own.Xu Qing felt that he might be able to endure until the fog dissipated, and the amount of anomalous substances in his body wouldn't skyrocket. However, the weak Captain Lei wouldn't be able to. If he was trapped in it, it wouldn't be long before he died from mutation.This gave Xu Qing no choice but to retreat, attempting to circle around the fog by going further out of its range.But... the fog was too heavy. No matter how quick he was, he was still caught in the situation where the fog surrounded them in all directions. There was nowhere to hide as they were drowned by the fog.However, very soon, the fog that drowned the area around Xu Qing thinned out gradually until it ultimately revealed a bewildered Xu Qing once again.He lowered his head and looked under his feet.There were no shadows at night, but Xu Qing could feel the fog around him. It was rushing rapidly into the space beneath his feet at that moment.It was like the shadow that couldn't be seen had formed a vortex and devoured its surrounding fog.The speed of this devouring wasn't quick. It also seemed to have had its fill after a while and stopped absorbing. This allowed the fog to drown the silhouette of Xu Qing yet again.However, after the shadow was done swallowing, a force seemed to pour into Xu Qing's body, converging at his eyes. The thick fog as far as the eyes could see became transparent in his vision.Or perhaps it couldn't be described with sight but perception!The fog was clearly there and was incomparably thick. However, with his perception, it was only slightly fuzzy, far from the stage where it would obstruct sight and make someone lose their way.This caused Xu Qing's breath to hurry. He lowered his head and looked at the missing shadow."You, what exactly are you…" Xu Qing muttered.After a while, he lifted his head and sensed his surroundings. Following a moment of silence, his body started moving immediately without reducing speed. Within the fog, he was like a ghost speeding past.Not long later, as Xu Qing was speeding through the thick fog, he saw living people.It was two scavengers.Xu Qing could vaguely remember seeing them at the campsite. These two people were currently holding each other's hands. Within the thick fog, they were like blind people as they slowly probed and moved forward.However, with Xu Qing's perception, he could see that they were going in circles as they moved forward. It was evident that they had each realized it as well. The perspiration on their forehead and the heavy breaths revealed their anxiety and despair about their future.After taking a glance at the two persons, Xu Qing retracted his gaze and wanted to turn and depart.He didn't have an overflowing amount of sympathy. Living in this cruel world, he had seen too many examples of people saving others without motive, in exchange for backlash against themselves.However, for those whose vision had been obscured, their sense of hearing would be extremely sharp. As such, Xu Qing's footsteps as he was leaving were still detected by them.The two looked nervous immediately. They couldn't distinguish the sounds of a human from a beast. So, one of them bellowed to express savageness, as though wanting to intimidate a beast.The other shouted for help. To show their sincerity, they even took out the white pills and spirit coins from their leather bag, verbally promising to give them out for a chance of survival. Xu Qing paused for a moment, turning back to look at the white pills in the person's hand as he considered Captain Lei's poor health.After some thought, he rummaged through the leather bag and found a candle to light. It illuminated the surrounding with a glow. However, the fire was weak, and with the suppression of the fog, it was slowly becoming dimmer.Under the cover of the light from the candle, Xu Qing retreated some distance away and looked at the two people in the near distance. Then, he spoke slowly.p "Go right and walk straight for seven steps, then ten steps to the left..."As Xu Qing's voice came through, the two scavengers trembled. Their faces donned a look of ecstasy and with hastened breaths, they followed Xu Qing's instructions.Very soon, they circled left and right under Xu Qing's successive instructions and avoided the spots where there was danger. The fog in front of them thinned as they got nearer to the lit candle.It lasted until they walked into the range of the candle that was about to be extinguished. The path around here was illuminated by the flames. Like a blind man who had regained sight, they fell beside the candle in an instant. They were agitated, their emotions intensely boiling over.As for Xu Qing, he was hiding at the edge of somewhere dark. Even with the illumination of the fire, his figure was still blurry. Watching the agitation of the two persons with a poker face, he spoke flatly."Give me white pills."  Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ One of them trembled. After surviving the calamity, he didn't have the slightest hesitation. He threw the leather bag containing the spirit coins and white pills to Xu Qing immediately and thanked him repeatedly.The other person was just about to take out his pills, but as his gaze swept across Xu Qing's silhouette, his excitement vanished.At the dark spot where Xu Qing was standing, the fog lingered thinly. Hence, in that person's eyes, although they couldn't make out Xu Qing's face, they could see his petite body and that he was carrying an unconscious person on his back.As such, there was a gleam in his eyes. However, he wore a smile on his face and displayed a sincere demeanor when he spoke."Little brother, I have eaten all the white pills that were on me, but don't worry, when the fog has cleared or if you have a way to escort me out, I will doubly repay you."With that, there was a glint in his eyes as he looked toward where Xu Qing was, with an eagerness to try an idea out.The companion next to him grew a little annoyed at the moment, feeling as though he had given his pouch too quickly.Xu Qing then stared deeply at the scavenger who had yet to give the white pills, but he didn't speak.With a wave of his right hand, a gust of wind blew and extinguished the candle's light in that instant. The surrounding plunged into pitch-black darkness and labyrinth fog once more.As a result, a cry of surprise came from one of the two scavengers. Xu Qing then approached them in a flash and plucked the leather bag from them. Following that, a serene voice echoed all around."There's no need anymore. You can stay here.""Wait, wait. I was wrong, I was really wrong. I'll give you the white pills, I…"The man was suddenly in a hurry, seemingly wanting to grab onto something. However, his body tripped over a tree that was in the way, and he fell.When he got up, his calls were even more anxious, and the deep regret he felt filled his body and mind."Little brother, listen to my explanation, I…"Xu Qing didn't bother about the man's shouts and approached the other scavenger who had given him the white pills.His expression was one of horror. Getting caught in the labyrinth fog once again filled him with panic. Without detecting it in the slightest, Xu Qing had passed by him and spoke quietly."Follow the sound of my footsteps."With that, Xu Qing didn't turn back and continued walking. As for the person, when he heard Xu Qing's words, his breaths grew hurried and he immediately listened for the footsteps and followed. At that moment, in the depths of his heart, he was exceptionally grateful for the speed of his repayment earlier.It was especially so after he heard the anxious wailing behind him turning quickly into a frenzied cursing after failing to call for help. The despair in that tone made his heart tremble. Toward the owner of the footsteps ahead of him, he held them in greater awe.

Chapter 36 Grandmaster Bai
Xu Qing didn't pay attention to the person following him. As Xu Qing walked with Captain Lei on his back, he took out the white pills from the leather bag and fed them to the latter.Perhaps it was the effect of the white pills, or maybe it was the efficacy of the seven-leaf grass, Captain Lei's complexion gradually stopped turning greenish-black.It was just that the anomalous substances in his body were too dense and even with Xu Qing's white pills, it couldn't be completely suppressed at this moment.As such, Captain Lei was still in a state of unconsciousness. It was apparent that what he experienced on this journey to the forbidden zone had affected him greatly.Hence… On the way back during this dark night, when Xu Qing encountered more scavengers who were in despair from being trapped within the labyrinth fog, he allowed them to follow behind him at the expense of white pills. They would then follow the sound of his footsteps to move forward.Of course, among them, there were still some 'blind' people. However, they ultimately became a reference for the grateful followers behind Xu Qing and caused them to revere him even more.Most of them speculated that he must be one of those who were born innately with great mental energy. Because only such a person would not be confined by the labyrinth fog.And with regard to this type of people, Xu Qing had heard about them from Luan Tooth previously. It was also what he thought about when he saved the first person in exchange for white pills. Hence, it became a cover-up, and he didn't worry about exposing his secret.His accumulations soon surpassed ten white pills, and this finally caused Captain Lei's complexion to recover, turning from the greenish-black to merely green. His breathing was evidently smoother by a lot as well.At the same time, Xu Qing discovered that the feedback from his shadow couldn't be sustained for a long period.Following his journey forward right now, the perception of the fog ahead was less transparent than before and gradually turned fuzzy. It seemed like it wouldn't be too long before his sight became the same as others.It was fortunate that the remaining distance to the outside world wasn't that far.Hence, as his vision started to turn blurry, Xu Qing hastened his speed, and the darkness in the sky dissipated when the early sun rose. The first rays of the morning sun spilled over the ground at that moment. He, who was carrying Captain Lei on his back, finally passed through the small crack between the branches and leaves and saw the outside world in the near distance.Xu Qing's mood fluctuated. His body leaped toward the boundary in an instant and headed out of the jungle in strides.The moment he stepped across the cold boundary, the breeze from the outside world carried the warmth of the sunlight, falling onto Xu Qing's body.Because the sun rays were too bright, he couldn't help but squint his eyes. As he stood there, he took a deep breath of the air.At that moment, the followers behind him also regained their sight one after another when they neared the edge of the boundary.Each of them held the agitation of someone who had narrowly escaped death, and they rushed out.As they stepped past the boundary, they became incessantly spirited. An old man even knelt on the ground and gently kissed the soil of the Earth.At that moment, they could finally take in Xu Qing's appearance and Captain Lei whom he was carrying on his back.  Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Not many people knew of Xu Qing, but there was no one who didn't know Captain Lei.Hence, when the sight of Xu Qing and Captain Lei reached their eyes, their recollection of Xu Qing surfaced one after another as well."Kid!""Captain Lei"The four or five followers were shaken, but as Xu Qing's gaze swept over them, they instinctively shut up.To be honest, the coldness Xu Qing had displayed toward those scavengers who harbored ill-intentions had long since intimidated them.After that, Xu Qing didn't bother with them and retracted his gaze. He was about to make a beeline for the campsite when two figures whizzed over at that moment, approaching swiftly.It was Cross and Luan Tooth. They had returned but didn't wait at the campsite. Instead, they were anxiously waiting outside.They had discussed it among themselves that if Captain Lei and the others didn't return that day, they would head back in again to search and rescue them.Hence, when they saw Xu Qing's silhouette from a distance, the two of them swiftly approached him.And when Cross noticed Captain Lei on Xu Qing's back, his pupils narrowed intensely, but when his gaze landed on Xu Qing's body, it softened.There was a change in Luan Tooth's expression as well, with her murderous intent spreading immediately. She looked toward the people who followed Xu Qing out.As a result, the breathing of those people grew hurried one after another. They all grew alert."It has nothing to do with them. We were also fortunate because of them, or else Captain Lei might not have been able to press on."Xu Qing spoke up, dissolving Luan Tooth's murderous intent. After that, those who followed him out let out a breath of relief. Now, when they looked at Xu Qing, it contained gratitude on top of awe. They then cupped their fist in the other hand as a sign of respect and left separately.After they left, Cross stepped forward to help Captain Lei off Xu Qing's back, but he was stopped by Xu Qing."Let Captain Lei sleep a while more. I can still carry on." Xu Qing took a deep breath."Alright, let us return to the campsite first and bring the leader to the doctor." Cross nodded and took a white pill to feed it to Captain Lei. With Luan Tooth, they escorted from each side, and the three of them sped toward the campsite.On the way, there were many times when Luan Tooth wanted to speak. But in the end, she still couldn't help but ask."Where's Barbaric Ghost? Are the Bloodshadow Team still pursuing and attacking?"Xu Qing stayed silent and spoke softly after a long while."Barbaric Ghost mutated and died in battle."That sentence stopped Cross and Luan Tooth in their tracks. They were speechless. Even if they were mentally prepared, there was still an intense sadness growing. Luan Tooth was even a little despondent.It was Xu Qing's second sentence that shook them, making them look at Xu Qing in disbelief."Bloodshadow Team, completely annihilated."Xu Qing lowered his head and slowly said while walking."Is that why leader's injuries and anomalous substances are so serious…"Luan Tooth muttered as though she had an answer. To their side, Cross's expression was a little odd; he thought perhaps that was not the case. As such, he stared deeply at Xu Qing but didn't ask about the details. Xu Qing didn't explain nor mention the incident with the singing voice. That was Captain Lei's secret, so whether or not it should be divulged wasn't up to him.Just like that, the three of them dashed the whole way, and it wasn't long before they reached the campsite. They then headed immediately to the carriage convoy from outside, where the doctor who had gained much popularity during this time was located.The people in the queue felt the somberness of the Thunder Team's members from their appearance. Spotting the unconscious Captain Lei, the person at the front of the queue outside of the doctor's tent cleverly gave way.This allowed everyone from the Thunder Team to step into the tent very quickly.The tent was huge and filled with a strong medicinal scent. In addition to a few guards in iron armor, there was also an ill-looking scavenger visiting the doctor.The person who was attending to the sick was a meager old man. He wore a set of ordinary but cleanly-washed gray long robes. Although wrinkles scattered around his face, there was vigor in his eyes. It seemed wise and farsighted, like the stars, as if it could see through a person's heart.On either side of the old man sat a young man and a young lady respectively. The man was a youth who seemed similar in age to Xu Qing. He wore a blue-colored long gown from silk with a black-colored jade headband on his head. Moreover, there was a jade pendant engraved with a dragon figure hanging by his waist, with a gold tassel scattered at the edge of the round cushion.The young man was handsome with a well-kempt appearance, but it seemed like he was still not fully awake. One of his hands supported his chin and he held a medical book in the other. He didn't seem like he had the energy to read it and was yawning from time to time.On the other side was a young girl, about sixteen or seventeen years old, in a long dress. Her long hair cascaded down like a waterfall, and she had a standard oval face. Her skin was snow-white, and she appeared refined and elegant.She had a pair of bright eyes that were as clear and bright as the multitude of stars. At that moment, she noticed the young man dozing off beside her and cracked a faint smile. Then, she lowered her head toward the pharmacopeia in her hands.In that smile, her eyes curved like a crescent moon, and it seemed as if her charm was overflowing.And between this frown and a smile, she revealed her elegance naturally. One couldn't help but gasp at her sharp and elegant radiance.The pair of golden boy and jade maiden* had a clear spirit that scavengers rarely saw. It made Luan Tooth feel inferior and even Cross took a few glances.As for Xu Qing, he looked at the medical books in their hands and his expression revealed envy. Soon, however, he retracted his gaze and placed more focus on the doctor in front of him.At that moment, the doctor was giving the scavenger who visited some instructions. After the scavenger left in gratitude, he washed his hands with the copper basin by his side and lifted his head to look at Xu Qing and his companions.His gaze swept past them and landed first on Xu Qing. His eyes seemed to be filled with some deep meaning behind them. Then, he looked at Captain Lei who was on Xu Qing's back as he spoke slowly."Put him down."Xu Qing didn't know why, but under the old man's gaze, he felt a little nervous. It was like he was back in the slums and was facing the sir who had taught them.As such, with the help of Cross, the two of them put Captain Lei down carefully, letting him lay flat in front of the old man.And it was at that moment that Captain Lei slowly regained consciousness. He started when he saw the tent and also spotted the doctor, Xu Qing, and the others. Just as he was about to get up on his feet, the elderly doctor spoke indifferently."Lie down properly."Those words made Captain Lei turn toward the doctor. As they looked at each other, Captain Lei still continued to get up without a word. After that, with Cross stepping forward to lend his arm as a support, Captain Lei bowed to the doctor."It's just a few injuries, but they still sent me here. I won't trouble Grandmaster Bai. I'm fine.""You know who I am?" The elderly doctor was puzzled as he looked over at Captain Lei."I've seen Grandmaster Bai once from a distance, many years ago." Captain Lei nodded respectfully.Grandmaster Bai stared deeply at Captain Lei and said slowly."Your recent injury isn't too serious, and the anomalous substances in your body are also suppressed, so it's not a major issue. As for the exhaustion of your state of mind, it is obvious that there was an undue fluctuation in your emotions lately, which hurt your heart meridian."Although the combination of all these is a little troublesome, it is still alright and treatable. But… this is not the main point."The main point is that there is an internal injury to your body that was incurred many years ago. I'm guessing someone crippled your foundation in your early years and your current cultivation was rebuilt from scratch. To be able to reach this level of cultivation after having your foundation crippled is not easy."It's just that, with all these mixed together, you've overused everything. It is difficult to treat them with ordinary medication, so I am also powerless. I'll give you a set of medications. To what extent it would be able to heal, will depend on your fate."But you must remember at all costs that from now on, you cannot continue your cultivation breathing technique. Otherwise, when the anomalous substances increase and cause the internal injury to relapse, then… you'll meet certain death."Hearing Grandmaster Bai's words, Cross and Luan Tooth fell into silence. It was apparent that they knew Captain Lei's foundation had been crippled before. However, Xu Qing didn't know about it and looked toward Captain Lei, suddenly recalling the singing in the forbidden zone and that pair of red female shoes."Is there no other way?" Cross asked slowly."There is. If you can find the heavenfate flower, which belongs to the category of heavenly ingredients and earthly treasures, then you can naturally continue to cultivate for another generation. It was said that one of such stalks once appeared in the forbidden zone near here."Cross went silent and Luan Tooth looked anxious. At this moment, Xu Qing looked at Captain Lei. Compared to them, Captain Lei looked calm and smiled slightly."It's not that serious. It's all chronic illnesses. We won't disturb Grandmaster Bai any longer," Captain Lei said and bowed to Grandmaster Bai. After that, he called out for Xu Qing and the others to leave.The three people, including Xu Qing, respectfully thanked Grandmaster Bai in succession and left with the medication in hand.However, Xu Qing, who had something on his mind, wondered if he was imagining things. When he took his leave after expressing his gratitude, he felt that the gaze Grandmaster Bai held toward him was one of scrutiny.The Thunder Team stayed quiet the whole way.When they were back at Captain Lei's residence, Cross and Luan Tooth looked as though they had something to say, but they were sent away by Captain Lei.It was only after they had left that Captain Lei took out some tobacco from the residence and a pipe from the leather bag. After loading it, he lit it and sucked a deep breath from it.As he exhaled, he let out a long and relaxed sigh. Looking at Xu Qing's concerned expression, he waved the pipe and laughed."I didn't think about smoking while in the forbidden zone, but taking a puff upon returning is truly comfortable. This thing is more effective than any medication."Xu Qing was just about to speak."What do you feel like eating today? I will make a meal for you… Accompany me for a drink." Captain Lei didn't let Xu Qing speak, as though he didn't wish to listen. Hence, Xu Qing looked at him quietly and nodded his head after a long while."I want to eat snake."[1] Golden boy and the jade maiden (金童玉女) are from Chinese mythology. In novels, they are often used to describe attractive and well-matched couples.

Chapter 37 Fireworks In The Human World
Within the scavenger's campsite, apart from the necessities for survival, meat was the next thing they had in abundance.This was due to the proximity to the forbidden zone. Some scavengers headed there every day, which was why there were several stalls selling edible meat.Captain Lei's wrinkled face broke into a restrained laugh upon hearing that Xu Qing wanted to eat snake meat.He understood that the reason why Xu Qing said snake meat was because of what he said back then. It was obvious that the kid in front of him had committed it to memory.As such, he stopped Xu Qing when he was about to head out to buy the meat."Those bunch of people in the campsite are all deceitful. You are not that knowledgeable about the mutated beasts from the forbidden zone. It'll be easy for you to get scammed and find yourself in a situation where you are being coerced to buy. It's still better for me to go instead." Captain Lei said as he stood up.Upon hearing the words, 'coerced to buy', Xu Qing subconsciously touched the iron stick and answered seriously after some thought."They won't."Captain Lei glanced at the iron stick and couldn't help laughing. Without speaking, he walked out of the courtyard.Watching Captain Lei's figure, Xu Qing deliberated, then walked into the side room. He washed the pans and bowls meticulously, then arranged and cleaned the table. Finally, he prepared three sets of bowls and chopsticks and placed them on top. Looking at the additional set, Xu Qing suddenly understood something."That is for a person who would never come." The words Captain Lei had once said surfaced in his mind. In his silence, he placed the third set of a bowl and chopsticks beside Captain Lei's set.He did the same for the chair.After doing these, Xu Qing turned his head and looked at the courtyard outside the house. At this moment, the sky had turned into dusk. There was a little chilliness in the breeze and within that, there were some indistinct snowflakes.During the end-of-March season for the eastern part of the Nanhuang Continent, while the weather was beginning to warm up again and everything was coming back to life, the winter days didn't seem to be resigned. From time to time, there would still be snowflakes falling, as though to tell all things that it hadn't left yet.At that moment, the snowflakes swayed in the overcast sky, blown down by the wind.They seemed to fall from Heaven to the human world. They then got scattered across the world, then swiftly melted from the warmth as well.Ultimately, you could see that it was just a land full of mud.No matter how prestigious a place it came from, no matter how clean it was, when it was in the human world, it would still be mixed with sludge. Blending together, indistinguishable from each other.There was no telling if it was the wind that held the snow, causing it to be icier. Or, was it the snow that infected the wind, causing it to be even more chilly?At the moment, as it was gusting through the earth, through the campsite, through the bamboo courtyard and residence, Xu Qing felt a little cold.Even though he was a cultivator, in the depths of his memory, there was still the fear of cold which had accumulated for years, and this made him feel somewhat uncomfortable in this freezing cold.It was until he saw an unsteady silhouette in this cold gust, shielding against the blizzard as they walked from afar and opened the door in the courtyard. The moment the figure was revealed, their voice which was laced with laughter penetrated the blizzard."Kid, you're in for a treat today. Look what I managed to buy. This is a redflower snake. The quality of meat on this snake can be regarded as premium. I'll show off my abilities for you in a while."Captain Lei carried the body of the snake and walked into the side room in large strides.Noticing the tidiness within the side room, the arrangement of tables and chairs, the bowls and chopsticks, and especially the two sets which were placed side by side, Captain Lei's wrinkled-filled face broke into a smile and stared deeply at Xu Qing."Do you want to learn how to cook a snake?" Captain Lei asked."I do." Xu Qing's eyes lit up. He was thirsty for everything that he didn't possess the knowledge of, especially the snake that Captain Lei cooked. It was delicious.Captain Lei laughed and called Xu Qing to his side. He introduced as he made it."Logically, you'd have to behead and remove the tail of this snake but those people don't know that the reason you must remove its tail was because of excretion. However, as long as you have removed the venom in the snake head, it could lift the flavor of the snake meat on a whole, enhancing its freshness."Captain Lei was delighted when he spoke about cooking.Xu Qing listened attentively from the side as well. Watched as Captain Lei cleaned the snake, skinned it then remove the internal organs and other junk from the body. He then chopped it into pieces before placing it to the side."Kid, you have to remember, whether there will be an aftertaste or not is still dependent on the soup."With that, Captain Lei began to slow boil the soup in a clay pot and added many medicinal ingredients to it. At last, the snake head which had been treated previously was thrown into the mix as well.After doing these, following the aroma which permeated the whole place, Xu Qing gulped. Witnessing this, Captain Lei laughed out loud and retrieved a clean wok. He then began to stir-fry the snake meat at high heat.In that instant, the pitter-patter sounds of the oil reverberated. Wafts of heavy fragrance assaulted the senses in waves, spreading out in the side room as it drifted out.It was as though it had dispersed all of the cold, making Xu Qing's stomach rumble uncontrollably. Looking at the boiling snake meat, even his eyes became straight.Very soon, following Captain Lei's fire, the stir-fried snake meant was also added to the pot. As he covered the lid, he looked toward Xu Qing."Have you learned it?"Xu Qing stared at the clap pot and nodded his head vigorously. He watched the entire process and didn't think it too difficult.Captain Lei smiled a little and left the side room. When he returned, he carried two alcohol flasks. He threw one of it to Xu Qing and held onto the other, exclaiming with praises when he took a gulp."There is no lack of meat in the campsite but this alcohol is a rare commodity."Xu Qing lifted the flask and looked into the turbid liquid. He had never drunk alcohol before.Just as Captain Lei said, this was considered a rare commodity. There was none of it in the slums, only some of the important figures in the cities would be able to taste it.But looking at the enjoyment on Captain Lei's face after drinking it, Xu Qing hesitantly placed it to the corner of his lips. After drinking a sip, his brows furrowed. He felt as though his entire mouth was filled with spiciness, but he still swallowed it.A stream of heat emerged from his throat as it flowed down his esophagus and into his stomach. Then, it exploded violently and heat spread throughout his entire body. It turned into a breath that gushed to his mouth, causing him to open it and let out an alcohol-laced breath."It's not pleasant." Xu Qing looked at Captain Lei.Captain Lei burst out into laughter when he heard that and pointed to Xu Qing."You're still too young and can't taste the flavor of alcohol. When you've grown older, you'll surely like it."With that, Captain Lei was about to take the alcohol flask from Xu Qing's hands but the latter dodged it."I will try some more." Xu Qing replied seriously and then took another sip. He was still frowning but at the same time, he got used to the strange taste.Not long after, under Captain Lei's good-natured teasing towards Xu Qing, the snake meat was done cooking.When he served the clay pot, the aroma diffused the moment he opened the lid. Xu Qing's adam apple involuntarily twitched and he put down the flask. He waited for Captain Lei to pick up a piece before he stabbed into one and wolfed it down. He still couldn't change the habit of wolfing down his food ravenously when eating.Just like that, while the wind and snow mingled outside, inside the residence, the old and young drank as they ate the meat, the feeling of warmth gradually suffused the atmosphere.Watching Xu Qing's awkward posture as he exerted his strength when using the chopsticks, Captain Lei's eyes revealed some gentleness behind them. He muttered in his heart."After all, he's still a child. It's a pity… that he lived in such a cruel world."When the blizzard gusted from outside, as there were gaps in the residence's structure, it managed to slip in through the cracks. Despite being covered in perspiration from eating the hot food, Xu Qing had some resistance to the cold wind as it landed on him causing him to merely curled his body slightly.That small gesture was caught by Captain Lei. He looked pensive but he didn't speak.After a long while, Xu Qing mimicked Captain Lei in taking another big gulp of alcohol and exhaling an alcohol-laced breath. The former watched the old man who brought him out of the ruined city and settled here, then spoke up abruptly."Your injuries…""No matter. I've already lived with it for so many years, why would I die this easily? It's fine."Xu Qing went silent. He wanted to question Captain Lei about the crippling of his foundation but when he recalled the scene in the forbidden zone, he didn't ask in the end.They ate the meal for a long time. Only after the alcohol flask in Captain Lei's hands was empty did he stand up. His eyes looked a little hazy as he returned to his room.Looking at his figure, Xu Qing could clearly feel that the vigor Captain Lei used to exude seemed to have dissipated a little after their return from the forbidden zone.Xu Qing was quiet and only got up after a while. He tidied up the dining table and cleaned the pots and bowls, before placing them neatly. Only then did he return to his room.Sitting on the bed plank, he raised his head towards the blizzard outside. He curled his body and retrieved the leather bag he picked up from the Bloodshadow Captain when he was in the forbidden zone.Even though there were no alchemy pills in it, there were a lot of spirit coins. There were also several miscellaneous items that Xu Qing checked through.Finally, he took out a black glove. The texture of it didn't feel like leather, more like metallic.When he tried it on, Xu Qing realized the item was very tough. It provided an impressive amount of protection. So, he struck a few punches with it on and thought it was not bad. Only then did he take it off and meditated with his eyes closed, starting his breathing technique.It was a night of silence.At dawn, the flurry of snow continued falling but it was warmer by much. After a night of freezing cold, the snowflakes which fell to the ground could finally exist for some time.Hence, when Xu Qing stepped out of the room, he saw traces on the snow.Xu Qing held his clothes tighter around him and glanced toward Captain Lei's residence. After exiting the courtyard, he thought he ought to do something. For example, buying some white pills for Captain Lei.As such, after heading out, the snow that Xu Qing stepped on let out a crunching sound as he walked toward the general store.When Xu Qing passed Grandmaster Bai's carriage fleet's tent, he could hear the faint sound of the young man and lady studying. That sound made him stop in his tracks and there was a look of envy in his eyes as he glanced over.After a while, he turned his head without speaking and continued towards the general store.As he neared, he could see the general store from afar as well as the little girl who was diligently clearing the snow tracks outside of it. Her garments were something thin, her tiny hands were red from the cold and there were clouds of vapor coming from her mouth.After days of not seeing her, the little girl seemed to have adapted a little to the life at the campsite. Though it was tiring, she was still earnest in cleaning up.Even though the snow was still falling, she still continued to sweep. It was just that the scar that ruined her face was a little obvious under the morning sun.When Xu Qing neared, the little girl seemed to sense it. Raising her head, her eyes lit up when she saw Xu Qing, revealing a joyful smile."Morning.""Morning…" Xu Qing was not used to such greetings. He nodded and then looked inside the general store.Perhaps it was because the sun had just come up, or maybe it was due to the weather, but there was no one inside. Not even the shop owner."What do you want to buy? I'll get it for you." The little girl smiled. n0(𝕧(e)lbi𝕟.n(et  "White pills." Xu Qing looked at her.At the sound of that, the little girl leaned the broom in her hands against the wall to her side. After she brought Xu Qing into the store, she ran to the back of the counter and rummaged through some things. Very soon, she took out a few leather bags as she opened them, and put them back.It was quite a while later before she a bag out and handed it to Xu Qing."The boss dictated we can only sell five a day, so I can't sell you more." The little girl was apologetic as she looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing could understand it. He took the leather bag and opened it to check. After that, his gaze froze slightly.He noticed that the white pill in this leather bag had a quality that was a lot better than what he bought previously. Among them, there were three which didn't have a smear of green and there was even a faint medicinal fragrance wafting from them.He thought back to the little girl's actions and then raised his head towards her."It's nothing. It's within my scope of authority." The little girl blinked and smiled.Xu Qing stared deeply at the little girl."Thank you.""You don't have to thank me for such a trivial matter. I'm the one who owes you my thanks. If it's not for you, I might not have survived until now."The little girl's smile was radiant and there was a glimmer in her eyes. After saying that, she seemed to have remembered something and whispered to Xu Qing as she escorted him out."I heard the boss talking about it yesterday. Recently, there were a lot of young people disappearing from the campsite and according to his expression, it seems like he didn't think it was caused by the dangers of the forbidden zone. More like it was caused by humans… Keep an eye out for yourself."There was concern in the little girl's eyes and Xu Qing was not used to such a gaze. He retreated a few steps and nodded, leaving after saying his thanks.He didn't walk too far before he turned his head. He stared at the figure of the little girl who continued to sweep the snow, and at the scar on her face under the sunlight. He suddenly remembered what Captain Lei said before, that there was a stone that could remove scars in the temper cluster at the forbidden zone."If there's a chance, I'll go find one for her." Xu Qing muttered in his heart then turned and left.The young man walked away, leaving a trail of tracks in the snow. The wind and snow behind him… grew even heavier

Chapter 38 Home? (1)
Amidst the wind and snow, Xu Qing returned to the courtyard. However, before he could even enter, he already heard the joyous laughter of Captain Lei from outside.Following that were the sounds of dogs barking. Pushing aside the gate, Xu Qing saw more than ten wild dogs in the courtyard.They all lay there and stared coldly at Xu Qing. However, Xu Qing swept his gaze past them without any ferocity. It was just a simple look, but the fur of those wild dogs stood, and they retreated slowly.A soft cry of surprise echoed from Captain Lei's room.As the gate opened, Cross and Luan Tooth walked out. They looked from Xu Qing to the tens of dogs, and then Cross cracked a small smile."Kid, the dogs are saying that there's a really strong baleful air coming from you." Luan Tooth squatted down and softly caressed the head of a wild dog by her side, smiling as she told him this.Xu Qing didn't say anything but looked at Captain Lei who had walked out of the room.Captain Lei was wearing a thick leather coat and carrying a tobacco pipe in his hand. When he stepped out, he pointed toward Luan Tooth and spoke exasperatedly."Luan Tooth, this girl, thinks I'm injured and worries about my safety at the campsite. So, she insisted on sending these dogs to guard the house and protect the yard."It was a simple sentence, but Xu Qing understood the meaning behind it. Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Captain Lei didn't tell them about the incident involving Xu Qing, just like Xu Qing didn't mention the singing voice. He let Captain Lei make his own decision, and Captain Lei also left the right to divulge that incident to Xu Qing.Xu Qing nodded. He then retrieved the leather bag with the white pills and passed it to Captain Lei.Captain Lei took it and swept a glance. He then laughed and didn't stand on ceremony."Alright, I do need these things but don't buy them anymore in the future. I have a lot of them saved up. I even have enough to sell." With that, he looked at Cross."Cross, the kid is back too. Whatever it is, you can talk about it now."Cross stopped smiling and his expression turned solemn as he slowly spoke."I came here today for two matters.""The first is about Captain Lei's medicine. Luan Tooth and I have purchased them, and it is about a month's worth of medication. Afterward, we'll purchase again when you're done with it." With that, he took down a leather bag by his waist and placed it to the side."Then, the second thing. Due to the elimination of the Bloodshadow Team, even though other scavengers also participated in the harvesting of seven-leaf grass, none of them harvested as many as ours."Luan Tooth and I handed it over to the camp leader yesterday and received the reward. However… As per the camp leader's habitual deductions, he didn't give us three clear dust pills. There was only one." As Cross said this, he looked at Luan Tooth.​ Luan Tooth took out four leather bags and placed them to the side. She retrieved a wooden box after that. In front of everyone, she opened it and revealed a green alchemy pill, the size of a pigeon's egg.The medicinal fragrance spread out. It was evident that this was much better than the white pill."Barbaric Ghost didn't have any relatives, so I took the liberty to distribute his share among us. These four leather bags contain our respective portion of spirit coins, and about this clear dust pill…" At that, Cross looked at Captain Lei and awaited his allocation."Let's give it to the kid," Captain Lei said quietly. At that moment, some of the imposing manners he had as the leader of the Thunder Team returned.Cross nodded. Luan Tooth was stunned for a moment then fell into deep thoughts. When they asked Captain Lei about what had happened in the jungle earlier, he didn't reveal it. However, with this allocation, the answer was obvious."About Barbaric Ghost… It was right to distribute his share. We are his relatives."Captain Lei sighed softly and picked up his share. Cross and Luan Tooth then picked up their respective portions as well. Xu Qing didn't make a noise and similarly picked up the leather bag.Regarding the clear dust pill that Luan Tooth passed over, Xu Qing took a look at Captain Lei after taking it. There was a sternness in Captain Lei's eyes that made Xu Qing understand the meaning behind it. Hence, he quietly kept it.The four conversed for a while, mainly between Cross and the other two persons. As usual, Xu Qing was reticent and listened quietly from the side.Yet, regardless of Cross or Luan Tooth, none of them neglected Xu Qing's existence. They would occasionally ask for his opinion.Just like that, as the time passed, noon came quickly. Following the temporary halt of the wind and snow, Cross and Luan Tooth chose to leave. Before they left, Cross whispered to Xu Qing."Kid, Luan Tooth and I have accepted a mission and will need to head out for a trip. During this time… the leader is in your care." As he said this, he took out a dagger and passed it to Xu Qing."Your dagger is full of rust. Use this instead, it's very sharp."Luan Tooth passed him a whistle as well."Kid, although you are strong in combat, you'll still need eyes and helpers, right? This whistle can easily control the wild dogs on the campsite. If there's a need, you can blow it. They are very smart and will know what to do."After a round of urging from the two of them, they cupped their fists with the other hand and took their leave.Looking at their silhouettes, Xu Qing kept the whistle and stuffed the dagger Cross gave into his boots. However, he didn't throw away the original dagger he had.Thereafter, he raised his head and stared at their figures until Cross and Luan Tooth disappeared from his vision. Xu Qing then turned his head and looked at Captain Lei's room.It was only after some time did he decide to walk through the wild dogs and into the residence.He then closed his eyes and sat cross-legged in meditation.The wind was strong outside and it made a whimpering noise. As it blew across the earth, the snow on the ground was mixed with the snow falling from mid-air. It then entered through all the gaps in the entrance of the tents and houses, alarming the people inside.It also reached the body of Captain Lei who was resting in the house. For someone who was long used to it, he didn't mind the cold wind.However, in his mind, the image of Xu Qing curling up in the cold surfaced. As such, he turned his head in the direction of Xu Qing's room, and after a moment of silence, he took his leather hat and left the residence.

Chapter 39 Home? (2)
Time flew by and it was three days in a blink of an eye.In those three days, it was like the blizzard was using up its last remaining power and scattered its leftover chill, causing snow to fall ceaselessly. The snow on the ground hadn't had time to melt before it accumulated a thick layer.Even though the weather was bad, for scavengers, survival was more important than the cold.As such, there were gradually more people at the campsite; some continued to seek treatment for their illnesses, while the others headed toward the forbidden zone.At the same time, as the Bloodshadow Team didn't return for a long time, it slowly led to discussions among the scavengers. It wasn't known where the rumors came from, but they said that the Bloodshadow Team had completely perished in the forbidden zone.Not many believed this at the start. After all, the members of the Bloodshadow Team couldn't be underestimated.Especially the Bloodshadow Captain, who was one of the strongest among the scavengers on the campsite. A person like that had visited the forbidden zone countless times, so the possibility of the entire team being wiped out was slim.However, two more days went by and there was still no sign of anyone from the Bloodshadow Team. This made the scavengers from the campsite believe in the rumors one after another.In addition, they recalled the day when Captain Lei returned in his unconscious state.And they also made the connection with Barbaric Ghost's disappearance. Everything seemed to have been answered.No matter if it was true or false, without Bloodshadow, the Thunder Team was now the strongest on the campsite.Hence, when Xu Qing headed out these days, what he saw most was the respectful gazes from the scavengers all around.He knew that what these people respected was the Thunder Team and not him personally. But he didn't mind it. Nowadays, he was puzzled about Captain Lei who always left early in the morning but returned late at night. He didn't know what the latter was busy with.However, Xu Qing understood that everyone was independent and so he didn't see a need to disturb him. Besides, there were a lot of things he had to do as well. For most of the time, Xu Qing stayed alone in the residence and cultivated quietly.With his diligence, his cultivation base improved slowly, and his strength and speed steadily increased.Regarding his shadow, Xu Qing looked into it many times as well.However, it seemed like the shadow still didn't have any changes apart from absorbing the anomalous substances. Everything was just like before, and it also caused the mutation point on Xu Qing's arm to vanish completely.The purity in his body caused Xu Qing to feel that his cultivation progress was evidently much faster than before.In the afternoon two days later, Xu Qing sat cross-legged and meditated. He prepared to first stabilize his cultivation from the past few days before attempting a breakthrough to the fourth level of Mountains and Seas Art. But at this moment, he frowned slightly and opened his eyes.The stray dogs were barking outside and someone was knocking on the bamboo gate.Xu Qing walked out of the residence and noted that Captain Lei wasn't back yet. He then looked to the other side of the bamboo gate and saw a scavenger with a look of hesitation on his face standing there.Xu Qing had seen that person before. He was one of the seven or eight people he had rescued before he returned from the forbidden zone.As the scavenger noticed the appearance of Xu Qing, he promptly clasped his hands."Brother Kid, it's me. I'm Bone Blade.""What's the matter?" Xu Qing donned a poker face and asked flatly."This…" Bone Blade had some reservations, but after a quick thought, he still gritted his teeth and then continued."Brother Kid, I wish to use five white pills in exchange for your insurance." With that, he threw a leather bag toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing didn't catch it and looked at Bone Blade suspiciously. Hence, the leather bag that the person threw landed on the ground. The stray dogs at the side went to take a look but didn't dare to approach it.Sensing Xu Qing's suspicion, Bone Blade, who was outside the bamboo gate, hurriedly gave his account of what he meant. And after listening to what he had to say, Xu Qing began to understand the meaning of this so-called insurance. Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ According to Bone Blade, he wanted Xu Qing to head toward the forbidden zone's Venomous Dragon Swamp area if the former didn't return in three days and rescue him just like before."Brother Kid, I'm not worried about the mutated beasts in the forbidden zone; it's my fate to die in their mouths. What I'm worried most about is the labyrinth fog. I'm truly not willing to die to it."Xu Qing had a strange look on his face, not expecting the other person to make such a request. Hence, he thought about it and asked."What if there is no fog in those three days, or if you make an early return?""You don't have to return the alchemy pills then. I'm just buying for peace of mind." Bone Blade bowed lowly to Xu Qing with a pleading look. Xu Qing stayed silent as he regarded the leather pouch. With a hook of the tip of his foot, he picked it up and checked its contents.There were five white pills in it. Although he did not need it, this was the campsite's currency. And so, after some thought, he figured that this request was feasible.Hence, after pondering, Xu Qing nodded.Seeing as Xu Qing agreed, Bone Blade let out a breath of relief. With gratitude, he cupped his fist and left.Xu Qing took the leather bag and squinted his eyes. He was naturally vigilant, and it wasn't like he completely believed the person's words.However, he didn't think that there was a huge possibility of it being a trap.If the fog didn't rise, then he could choose not to go. And if the other person could accurately estimate the timing of the fog three days in advance, then with such an ability, there was no need for him to play tricks on others.Even so, Xu Qing remained vigilant and planned to make a decision only when the time came.Thus, he turned and returned to the residence and continued with his meditation. A night then passed.The next morning, Xu Qing had just completed his cultivation when he raised his head and looked out of the room. He heard the dogs outside barking.When he stepped out, he witnessed a strange scene. Captain Lei was currently packing up. He tied big bags and small parcels on the stray dogs' bodies one by one, causing them to stick out their tongues. Some of them were about to collapse on their stomachs from the weight."You're done cultivating? Let's go, I'm bringing you somewhere."Captain Lei wiped his perspiration and smiled as he spoke. After that, he patted the stray dogs by the side and opened the bamboo gate. He then waved to Xu Qing.Xu Qing was confused. He followed over with those stray dogs trailing behind. Just like that, the two people and a pack of dogs strode through the campsite.From the center-ring region to the inner-ring region. There were a lot of shops here, and the houses were largely made of bricks. All of them looked very solidly built.They walked until they reached a huge courtyard with four independent brick houses in it. Each one of them was much better than all the places Xu Qing had resided before. They were much sturdier and denser in comparison.After he looked at this, Xu Qing turned toward Captain Lei."This will be our new home from now on," Captain Lei said with a smile."New home?" Xu Qing was stunned. The word, "home", gave him a familiar sense of unfamiliarity."I have been busy for half my life and saved a lot. Since my body is giving way now, I might as well move to a bigger house and enjoy life."Captain Lei laughed and walked ahead. After that, he took the baggage from the dogs and began to get busy.Xu Qing stood there and slowly began to enter only after a while. He looked at the bricks on the floor and at the houses in front of him as he fell into a trance. Even after Captain Lei called him to help out, he still hadn't gotten used to it.After that, it was half a day of hustle and bustle. When the night arrived once more, the cold wind still gusted outside. The blizzard was still there, and while the whistling sounds of the gale filled the atmosphere, Xu Qing and Captain Lei sat beside a stove in the house. The warmth gushed toward them and filled the air in the whole room.There were no cracks in the wall here, so the ice-cold wind couldn't enter at all. Xu Qing quickly realized this and felt his body was comfortably warm."Not cold anymore, right?" Captain Lei had a smile on his face."Mm. Not cold anymore." Xu Qing nodded. Under the light of the stove, there seemed to be a glimmer in Xu Qing's eyes when he looked over at Captain Lei.He was indeed not cold anymore. In this warmth, Xu Qing even felt a fluttering in the depths of his heart.After a long time, when Captain Lei returned to his room, Xu Qing was sitting near the stove on his own and muttered."Home?",m At that moment, in the house by the side, Captain Lei who returned to his room had the remnants of a smile on his face. However, his face soon turned somewhat red.He covered his mouth and coughed a few times. After a while, he swallowed the fishy taste down his throat. With a soft sigh, he stood beside the window and lifted his head as he looked toward the forbidden zone. Memories surfaced in his gaze as he mumbled."I really want to... go there and take a look again."

Chapter 40 Thirst For Knowledge
That very night, Xu Qing had a dream.This was the first time in over six years that he stayed in such a luxurious house and didn't feel the chill from outside. At the same time, it was also a rare night where he had dreams.In the dream, this world wasn't a cruel one. The sky didn't have the fragmented face of the god, and his parents were also beside him. He even had an elder brother.Also, he was living a worry-free life and going to school with a group of play companions. After school, he returned to his warm house and ate the piping hot dinner together with his loved ones, enjoying a beautiful sleep later at night.However, all his loved ones in the dream had somewhat blurry appearances.He really wanted to see them clearly, but there was always a layer of mist shrouding them. The dream lasted all the way until morning arrived. Xu Qing who was lying on his bed finally opened his eyes.He stared at the ceiling and rested for a moment as though he was completely awakening from the dream before he silently stared at the surroundings…Inside this grayish-black room constructed from bricks, not only were there a table, chairs, and a bed, but there was even a bathroom with lingering warmth on its floor. This warmth was something left behind by the heat of the stove last night.On the floor, there was a mat weaved from straw, and there was an empty bookshelf at the side.This place looked simple, but in Xu Qing's heart, it was already very luxurious.Xu Qing took a deep breath and walked toward the bathroom. He then carefully stretched out his hands and placed them inside the water. As he watched his dirt-covered hands slowly reverting to their normal color from the water, he swiftly lifted them up.He lowered his head and stared for a moment before wiping them on his body and getting them dirty again. After that, he glanced up and looked at his reflection in the mirror.A large leather coat, a head full of messy raven-black hair, a dirt-covered little face, and that pair of clear eyes.After some time, Xu Qing turned and gazed toward the windows. The clarity in his eyes was then replaced by indifference.The wind and snow had stopped in the world outside the window, and sunlight streamed down. This was the final snow of winter, and the snow on the ground was slowly disappearing.On the trees in the distance, as the remnants of snow melted, green buds could be seen. It was as though they were telling everyone that spring…had truly arrived.Xu Qing walked out of his room and habitually cast a glance at Captain Lei's residence. As for the over ten wild dogs in the courtyard, they didn't even lift their heads. They merely swept their tails across the ground in greeting."What should I do?" Xu Qing silently mused as a hint of determination appeared in his gaze.Hence, he pushed the courtyard gate open and walked out. His target was clear. It was none other than the tent where the doctor of the carriages was in.During the early morning, there weren't many scavengers at the campsite.As Xu Qing moved closer to the fleet of carriages, all the guards there swept their gazes over to him, and Xu Qing could faintly hear the sounds of studying drifting from the tent the doctor was in.,m He hesitated for a while before he quietly stood outside the tent, waiting in silence.The guards around the convoy all looked at him with scrutiny. After observing for some time, half of them retracted their gazes, but a few were still observing him closely.Xu Qing wasn't bothered by these. This was because he could hear the sounds of studying drifting out from within. As he listened, he gradually fell into a daze. He also discovered that there wasn't only the sound of people studying inside the tent; the teacher inside was testing his students too."Goldturn grass, also known as the three-leaf pearl or the coldscatter grass. It is the white water sedge that belongs to the cyperaceae-class of plants and would only be birthed after many years. It grows in forests under the hillsides and in spacious wet areas. They can be found in Lingyou, the southern part of Nanhuang, and the two continents of Guangling. Its effects consist of soothing the lungs and stopping coughs, mild detoxification, dispersion of bruises, and curing venomous snake bites or injuries from a fall. It can be matched with…"The young girl's voice that was originally filled with confidence started to have some hesitation as she continued speaking. Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Match with what?" In the tent, Grandmaster Bai's imposing voice was filled with strictness."It can be matched with the rhino-fire flower to be concocted in the medicine. Borrowing yang to transform yin, it can become a drop of poison-avoidance liquid, which is one of the basic ingredients for the Great Transformation Pill." The young girl seemed to be a little afraid. Her speed of speaking increased by quite a lot, and she even heaved a sigh of relief after she finished speaking.Xu Qing stood outside the tent and grew increasingly serious as he listened to these."Whiteback root, also known as…eh. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae-class, the root of a plant named 'turn-in-the-wind'. Its taste is slightly bitter. It can be found in…and the effects are treating something of the five inner organs…" That youth began to hesitate as he spoke and at the end, he directly stopped. Evidently, he had forgotten it.Inside the tent, the youth who sat together with the young girl now had a look of nervousness on his face. He was very anxious, but he simply couldn't recall. Hence, he glanced pleadingly at the young girl.The young girl beside him clearly knew the answer, but she didn't remind him no matter what. In the end, the youth could only have a depressed look on his face.And in front of them was Grandmaster Bai. At this moment, he turned his head and glanced outside the tent. The guard there immediately looked over and immediately asked with his eyes if Grandmaster Bai had any requests.Grandmaster Bai thought about it before slightly shaking his head. After that, he coldly snorted at the stammering youth."Tonight, you shall copy the Grasswood Scripture ten times!"This time around, the youth really wanted to cry, but he didn't dare to make any rebuttal. Hence, he could only hang his head depressedly and silently wailed.After Grandmaster Bai finished testing his two disciples, he calmly continued and spoke about the lesson today. His voice was slightly louder than before and also much clearer.The youth didn't notice this, but the young girl was meticulous by nature. Hence, she felt a little puzzled and blinked her eyes while casting a glance at the tent entrance. As she looked over, she could see a small and skinny figure standing near the tent under the reflection of the sun.Xu Qing, who was outside the tent, listened even more seriously. Every word and sentence spoken by Grandmaster Bai was deeply remembered by him as he was afraid he might forget even the slightest bit. To him, knowledge was something extremely valuable that he thirsted for.Just like this, time slowly passed. Today, the duration of Grandmaster Bai's lesson also exceeded the norm by almost twice. Only after the sun was high up in the sky and there was a long line of scavengers waiting for treatment queuing up did Grandmaster Bai end his lesson. A hoarse-sounding voice then rang out."The youth outside, you can enter."Xu Qing quivered and was awakened from his state of learning, which he didn't want to end. He then took a deep breath and carefully pushed the tent's flap open guiltily. After he entered, he stood silently at the side, feeling somewhat ill at ease.Originally, he wouldn't be like this, but he had come here to make an inquiry today and he had even eavesdropped for such a long time outside. In the slums, such behavior would easily inspire disgust from others.As though Grandmaster Bai could see the youth's nervousness, he slowed his pace of speaking and calmly spoke. "What's the matter?"As his voice rang out, the young girl at the side surveyed Xu Qing with curiosity.She had some recollection of this kid. She remembered that several days ago, this kid had carried an old man here for medical treatment."I greet Grandmaster Bai." Xu Qing lowered his head and imitated what Captain Lei did, dipping into a deep bow toward Grandmaster Bai.After that, he hesitated for a while before saying that he wanted to inquire about the heavenfate flower.After he spoke, he took out five white pills from his pouch and placed them before Grandmaster Bai.The usual fee was a single white pill, but Xu Qing felt one white pill was insufficient given that he had listened to a lesson from the other party. In fact, even five white pills were not enough.He then took out another 10 spirit coins and placed them together with the white pills.Only after doing this did his heart settle down.Grandmaster Bai cast a deep glance at Xu Qing before turning to the young girl at the side as he slowly spoke."Yu Ting, you will answer his question."The girl sat up straight and had a solemn look on her face as she confidently spoke."The heavenfate flower, also known as the life-extension blaze and the divine spirit grass. It is a mutated variant of the divine-class plant, compound wood. According to records, there are a total of 73 variants, but only the first variant can be used in medicine. It grows in any area within a forbidden zone, but there are no rules to dictate where it might be found. It is extremely rare."Its effects consist of allowing broken limbs to regenerate, even capable of reigniting one's lifeforce. Other than soul injuries, it can cure everything." As she spoke, the young girl swiftly took out a book from the side. After flipping a few pages through it, she revealed the picture on the page."Its appearance looks like this."What was seen in the picture was an ordinary stalk of herb that didn't seem to have any marvelous aspects about it. Only the jagged edges at the side of the grass were a little obvious. At the same time, there was a strange symbol formed by a silk thread in the middle.Xu Qing looked at it attentively. After memorizing it, he bowed deeply at both Grandmaster Bai and the young girl. He then turned and prepared to leave.Before he left, he heard the calm voice of Grandmaster Bai behind him."This herb can only be acquired by luck and not actively sought after. There are always powerful mutated beasts around it. You should know your limits."Upon hearing this, Xu Qing bowed again. After he left the tent, he rapidly sped through the campsite.After he used his greatest speed to return to his residence, he immediately took out a piece of bamboo from his leather pouch and used a bamboo stick to engrave everything the young girl had spoken about the heavenfate flower as well as the picture down.After some contemplation, he also recorded the content of the lesson he had heard today.Finally, he glanced at the bamboo piece that was densely filled with countless tiny words as he felt very satisfied in his heart. He then kept it well carefully like it was a precious treasure."How good would it be if I could continue to listen," Xu Qing muttered in a low voice. He started to think of ways to listen to the lessons. After some time, he refocused and started to cultivate.During that night, after Captain Lei returned, he told Captain Lei that he wished to make a trip to the forbidden zone. When Captain Lei heard this, he wanted to stop Xu Qing but hesitated.Eventually, Captain Lei still nodded and told Xu Qing about his experiences.Just like how the elderly at home would be worried about their own descendants venturing out, Captain Lei's stories were extremely detailed.He only finished telling Xu Qing about his experiences when dawn almost arrived. After Xu Qing remembered them, Captain Lei gave him another leather sack that contained the various types of medical powder Luan Tooth left behind.After understanding their specific uses, when morning came, Xu Qing bid farewell and left the campsite. He traveled rapidly through the wilderness and arrived outside the forbidden zone not long later.The instant he stepped into the boundary, the warmth of the sunlight outside seemed to be isolated, and a sinister chill drilled into his body. Xu Qing's eyes narrowed with vigilance as he 'transformed' into a fleeting shadow as he sped into the jungle.His figure vanished completely after a few breaths of time.This was his second time entering the jungle in the forbidden zone. Xu Qing's familiarity with this place was already different from the past.But the more it was so, the more cautious he became. As he leaped forward, he also paid attention to the flowers and herbs in the surroundings. Very soon, he arrived at the location where the silt was found back then. He copied Luan Tooth's previous actions and smeared the silt onto his body before he continued to advance.Time flowed by and an entire day soon passed.When he arrived here this time around, Xu Qing didn't encounter the fog. And although there were powerful mutated beasts, due to Xu Qing's cautiousness, he managed to avoid them all.On his way, he also paid close attention to the flowers and herbs around him as he searched for the heavenfate flower.At this moment, he encountered the place where they had met the black-scaled wolf previously. He surveyed the surroundings, and he could still see traces of their previous arrangements. It was just that the majority of the wolf corpses on the ground then had now transformed into rotting bones.He attentively observed the rotting corpses and discovered that there were no signs of them being bitten, but they had rotted naturally. Xu Qing then heaved a sigh of relief.This indicated that most probably, no mutated beasts had come here.Hence, he found a nearby area in the surroundings and decided to spend the night there before continuing after the sky turned bright.Very soon, night descended and the jungle fell into darkness. Xu Qing was now hiding inside a tree crack and staring in the direction of the Seven-leaf Grass Canyon. Further down that direction was the group of temples.This time around, other than wanting to find the heavenfate flower in the forbidden zone, he had another thought. He also wanted to help the little girl find a stone that could remove scars."Let's go and take a look," Xu Qing mumbled.
