"Junior Brother, my name is Xu Yanhong. I'm from Team Nine of the Earth Division. It just so happens that I'm on duty today. It's also fate between us." Xu Yanhong brought Xu Qing along as they walked through the Homicide Department. She then attentively pointed to various buildings and introduced them to him."This is the deputy director's office. There's one there too.""Senior Sister Xu, may I know how many deputy directors there are?" Xu Qing asked after some thought."We have one director and four deputy directors in our Homicide Department. We are divided into the Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow Divisions. Each division has nine patrol teams under them. You are going to the Black Team Six.""Your luck isn't bad. Your Black Division's deputy director is in closed-door cultivation all year round and we rarely encounter him. That way, you'll have a lot more free time." Hearing Xu Qing calling her senior sister, the female disciple smiled again and explained.Not long later, under her lead, Xu Qing was brought to the location of the Black Division. The entire Black Division was located in the southwest direction of the Homicide Department. There were more than ten small buildings there and many cultivators were entering and exiting them busily.It seemed that there were some taboos between the various branches, so Xu Yanhong didn't enter. After she sent Xu Qing over, she exchanged voice transmissions and left.Here, Xu Qing met the captain of Team Six.This wasn't the first time he had seen this person. He was none other than the youth he had encountered on the way last night who had given him a sense of crisis. This coincidence caused Xu Qing to be on his guard once again.When the young man saw Xu Qing, he first swept his gaze across Xu Qing's face a few times before quickly recognizing him. However, he didn't seem surprised by Xu Qing's arrival.This scene caused Xu Qing to fall into deep thought. He then calmly took a few steps back."I was the one who talked to the director this morning and specifically asked you to come over. I didn't expect that after you wiped your face clean, there would be such a huge difference from yesterday." The captain of Team Six didn't hide anything and directly exposed him."Greetings, Captain." Xu Qing glanced at the captain as he grew even more vigilant."You're not surprised?" The captain of Team Six smiled faintly."I am surprised." Xu Qing nodded."Why are you so calm then?" The captain of Team Six asked in surprise.Xu Qing wasn't good with words but he felt that what the other party said made sense. Hence, he thought about it and squeezed out a surprised expression."‚Ä¶" The captain of Team Six was silent for a long time before he spoke."The reason why I asked for you is because quite a few of my team members have died in the past few days and we are short of manpower. Also, the following missions are very heavy." After saying this, the captain of Team Six looked at Xu Qing.When Xu Qing heard that several of his comrades had died, his heart sank. However, he didn't ask about it. Instead, he looked at the captain and waited for him to continue.Seeing Xu Qing like this, the captain of Team Six smiled in satisfaction. "Not bad. You're stronger than those newcomers from before. Xu Qing, this is your first time here today, so you're still not familiar with it. How about this, I'll bring you on a patrol and tell you in detail about the duties of the Homicide Department." no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The captain was also a decisive person. After he finished speaking, he didn't introduce the other team members to Xu Qing and directly left with him, walking on the streets.On the bustling streets, the captain led Xu Qing as they strolled forward. From time to time, they would greet the shops in the surroundings, appearing very gentle. However, Xu Qing had seen the viciousness in the other party's eyes last night and knew that this person wasn't as gentle as he seemed on the surface. Hence, he maintained a certain distance and was on guard.He also made a judgment about the captain's cultivation level. He felt that the captain should be at the ninth or tenth level of Qi Condensation.The strength of the disciples at the ninth or tenth level of Qi Condensation from the Seven Blood Eyes had already surpassed that of Xu Qing's."Don't keep a straight face all day. Here, you have to learn to have two faces. Otherwise, you won't live long." The captain of Team Six looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing fell silent and pondered for a moment. He felt that these words made sense, so he tried his best to adjust his appearance. However, after seven years of experience, it was hard for him to change completely in a short period of time."Forget it, you can take your time to adjust." The captain of Team Six smiled helplessly. He felt that he had recruited a freak, so he bought a few apples from the side but didn't give them to Xu Qing.Xu Qing took a look and bought two as well."I'll tell you about the responsibilities of our Seventh Peak's Homicide Department. We only do one thing and that is to kill people." As he spoke, the captain of Team Six saw a homeless man by the roadside.He casually tossed two spirit coins over. The homeless man was very grateful.Xu Qing glanced at the homeless man. The other party wasn't a cultivator. Hence, he recalled the captain's words and asked."Kill people?"The captain of Team Six took a bite of the apple and swallowed it with a crunch. He looked very sweet as he casually spoke."Protecting civilians from the invasion of disciples and evil forces and making them work hard to earn money and pay residency fees to maintain basic public security is what the Patrol Department has to do. However, when they encounter things that they can't handle, such as facing fugitives and savage cultivators who have crossed the line, they will require our Homicide Department to act.""That's why the missions we face are all extremely dangerous missions that cause us to suffer great losses. In front of you, the team has changed countless times. Some died on missions and some were secretly killed. So, you have to be careful from now on.""However, there are also benefits to being here. The treatment is not bad and it's the only department that can exchange wanted criminals for money." After saying that, the captain took another bite of the apple.Xu Qing looked at the apple in his hand and fell silent for a moment before asking seriously:"What about the ownership of the other party's items after killing them?""Hmm?" The captain of Team Six turned his head and sized up Xu Qing seriously for the first time. A smile then appeared on his face.

Chapter 92 The Strange Captain (3)
"Interesting. You're the first newbie to ask such a question after hearing my introduction. In that case, I'll talk a little more with you. After you kill a desperado and a savage, the spoils of war will be yours. If everyone attacks together, the spoils will naturally be distributed.""Also, if you see some people in the main city, it's best to avoid them. You can't afford to offend them." As the captain spoke, he pointed to the distant street. There was a youth wearing a light purple Daoist robe there. He was walking proudly through the crowd and stepped into a shop. The shopkeeper of the shop respectfully went out to welcome him.When everyone in the surroundings saw the Daoist robe he was wearing, they all had respectful expressions and lowered their heads. Even some of the patrolling disciples were the same.It was as though this person's appearance was like a divine son who had entered the mortal world. No one dared to look at him directly.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed."You have to remember that in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, the people in dark-colored Daoist robes and those in light-colored Daoist robes cannot be provoked. The former‚Ä¶ are Foundation Building seniors on the mountain and you can't afford to offend them. As for the latter, they are core disciples who can stay on the mountain. Their cultivation levels aren't at the Foundation Building realm but they are lucky.""It's not a big deal if a hundred of us die but it's a big deal if one of these lucky core disciples dies."Xu Qing fell silent and lifted his head to look at the seven peaks of the Seven Blood Eyes in the distance."Just be envious. Live well and cultivate well. When you advance to the Foundation Building Stage, these core disciples will have to lower their heads when they see you." The captain chewed on an apple with a normal expression."Also, let me remind you again. On the surface, the sect doesn't allow us gray-robed disciples to kill each other but it's only on the surface. So, you have to learn how to deal with corpses. It's best if you take the other party's contribution points and spirit stones and let him return to zero to be expelled by the array formation‚Ä¶" The captain coughed and gestured with his chin toward the street on the other side."Just like that person."Xu Qing followed the captain's gaze and saw a gray-robed youth lying there. This youth was on the verge of death and his entire body was covered in injuries. At this moment, his eyes were filled with resentment and grief.However, his mouth was smashed and his limbs were broken. He couldn't say a word, let alone move. The identity token on his chest had returned to zero.Very soon, Xu Qing witnessed with his own eyes that the time limit for the youth to leave had passed. As a beam of black light descended from the sky, his figure twitched intensely and his body and spirit were destroyed, turning into ashes.His vitality seemed to be sucked away, merging into nothingness and disappearing.This scene caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow. As for the pedestrians in the surroundings, they seemed to be used to this. They didn't even take a look and continued to leave in a hurry with indifference."This person has committed many acts of murder and robbery against fellow disciples. It's normal for him to be killed by someone now." The captain smiled and was about to continue speaking when his expression suddenly froze as he looked not far away.Xu Qing, who was at the side, turned his head almost at the same time as him and looked at the alley not far away. There were fluctuations of anomalous substances there.The place they were at was considered a bustling city but this alley was very dark and out of place. Most of the people on the road avoided it."How dare this happen in broad daylight." The captain of Team Six sighed."Junior Brother, wait for me for a while." With that, he took the apple that was almost finished and walked toward the alley not far away. Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he watched the captain enter the alley. In just over ten breaths of time, the figure of the captain of Team Six walked out of the alley while eating an apple.A faint smell of blood permeated the air.Xu Qing glanced at the alley."There's an unlucky fellow who had a problem with his mutated beast organ transplant and turned into a mutated beast. I advise you not to take this path in the future. Although it can quickly increase your cultivation, there will be endless trouble in the future." The captain of Team Six smiled gently with a harmless expression as he continued walking.Xu Qing fell silent. The person he killed last night also had mutated beast organs transplanted. Before this, Xu Qing didn't know that this could be done.At that moment, he nodded and looked at his captain eating the apple happily. Hence, he picked up the portion he bought and took a bite as well. It was indeed very fragrant.Just like that, the two of them ate the apple as they walked through the city. Time slowly flowed by. The captain of Team Six ate quickly while Xu Qing ate slowly.At the back, the captain looked at the other apple in Xu Qing's hand many times. Xu Qing also looked at him and took another bite.The captain rubbed his nose and took out an orange from his pocket to eat."I'll tell you about the recent missions. Our main goal these days is to search for the remnants of Night Dove.""Night Dove?" Xu Qing's eyes narrowed."Night Dove is a very mysterious and huge organization in the Nanhuang Continent. They specialize in selling children and cultivators to be treasure-nurturers. It's fine if they do such dirty things outside but they actually came to my Seven Blood Eyes to do such a thing recently, causing the commoners to be anxious. If this continues, those big shots on the mountain will be unhappy when they see that their income is low.""You saw it last night as well. One of their leaders has been killed by the director. The remaining survivors need our Homicide Department to move out together and eliminate the root of the problem."When Xu Qing heard this, a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He immediately thought of the old man from the convoy whom he had killed. His eyes slowly narrowed as he nodded lightly. no(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The captain of Team Six was a smart person. He swept a glance at Xu Qing and seemed to have seen something. However, he didn't ask about it. Instead, he brought Xu Qing around the city and introduced him to the patrol team.On the way, Xu Qing saw a wandering child. Hence, he thought of his captain's previous actions and gave him a spirit coin.,m "Eh, is this also your informant?" The captain blinked and looked at Xu Qing with a spurious smile.Xu Qing started and understood. He didn't say anything but he felt like he had been played.Soon, when the sun was about to set, they arrived at the harbor.As they walked in, an honest voice rang out from afar at a place where a large number of goods were being transported and piled up into small mountains."If you say another word, I'll tear your mouth apart."Xu Qing lifted his head and looked over. He immediately saw a Seventh Peak's disciple squatting beside a pile of goods not far away. This person was a middle-aged man. He looked ordinary and honest.He was the one who said those words.In front of him was an old man dressed in luxurious clothes. At that moment, his expression was filled with anger. Clearly, he had gotten into an argument with the middle-aged man earlier."Whose mouth do you want to tear apart? Zhang San." The captain of Team Six finished the orange in his hand and took out another pear. After taking a bite, he walked over.Upon seeing the captain of Team Six, the expression of the old man changed and he hurriedly left. As for the middle-aged disciple who was sitting there, he turned his head and smiled foolishly at the captain. After greeting him, he smiled foolishly at Xu Qing as well."This is Xu Qing, a new member of our Homicide Department." The captain of Team Six introduced with a smile. After that, he pointed at the middle-aged disciple and spoke to Xu Qing."His name is Zhang San. He used to be a member of ours. Later on, he was afraid of death and was transferred to the Transportation Department. Don't be fooled by his simple and honest appearance. The pirate rogue cultivators who died in his hands‚Ä¶""You can fill this place up." The captain of Team Six gestured toward the majestic goods.Xu Qing immediately became vigilant. What made him even more focused was that he didn't sense any strong fluctuations from the other party's body. If what the Team Six captain said was true, then there was clearly something strange about this ordinary-looking Zhang San."How could that be? It's all rumors. I only killed a few petty thieves. Sigh, I still feel pity for them even now." Zhang San helplessly rubbed his hands and continued to smile foolishly.Xu Qing fell silent. He didn't see any hint of pity on the other party's face."Junior Brother Xu Qing, don't listen to the captain's nonsense. Please take care of me in the future." As Zhang San spoke, he flipped his body and handed Xu Qing a piece of beast bone."A meeting gift."

Chapter 93 Newbie Of The Homicide Department (1)
The shape of this beast bone was like a hook. It was the size of a palm and was completely red in color. It shone with a strange light.Upon closer inspection, one could see some natural patterns on the surface.These patterns seemed to contain some Dao accumulations and could absorb the spirit energy from all directions on their own. They then transformed into wisps of wind that surrounded Zhang San's palm."The Immortal Fish Bone of the Flying-Winged Fish? With the help of the array formation, this thing can boost the speed of the magic boat quite well. Zhang San, why are you so generous today?" The captain of Team Six ate the pear in his hand and squatted beside Zhang San. He nudged Zhang San with his shoulder and smiled."It's Junior Brother Xu Qing's first time here. No matter what, I have to show my gratitude." Zhang San said honestly.Xu Qing didn't accept the gift. Instead, he looked at the captain and sought his opinion. He felt that the reason why Zhang San acted this way wasn't because of him but because of the captain.Seeing Xu Qing's gaze, the captain smiled."Take it. He gave you this to tell you that you should stop coming here to hunt for criminals in the future."When Xu Qing heard this, he glanced at Zhang San, who smiled honestly.Xu Qing nodded. He took the fishbone and examined it curiously before putting it into his pocket.After thinking about it, he imitated his captain and squatted at the side but he maintained a certain distance.Seeing Xu Qing like this, Zhang San's smile became even more sincere."Zhang San, have there been any abnormalities here recently?" The captain finished the pear in his hand and took out another peach to eat.Xu Qing immediately paid attention and looked at Zhang San.Zhang San took out a pipe and placed it in his mouth to smoke. After that, he tapped it on the ground. After the ash fell, it transformed into a picture of a human face and a line of words on the ground."There are many new faces at the south pier recently."The captain of Team Six fell into deep thought. He then patted Zhang San's shoulder and smiled at Xu Qing."Junior Brother, you can go back first. You're off duty today. Remember not to be late tomorrow."When Xu Qing heard this, he knew that these two people had something to say. Hence, he nodded and cupped his fists toward the captain and Zhang San before turning to leave.At that moment, it was the setting sun. The orange sunlight scattered on his body, illuminating the dazzling colors of his gray Daoist robe. As he left, the two people squatting behind him raised their heads and stared at him.  Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé The captain smiled and spoke after Xu Qing had walked far away."How is this newbie? It's rare for you to be so generous today.""Newbie? Where did you find such a fellow? When this kid saw me, his first reaction was to look at my neck. How can I not be magnanimous when facing such a person?!" When the captain heard this, he laughed out loud."You're still laughing? What kind of habit would develop the instinct to look at someone's neck?"Zhang San smiled bitterly and touched his neck. He still felt a little uncomfortable and took a deep puff of his pipe."Of course it's someone who's used to cutting throats." The captain of Team Six smiled happily. After he finished the peach in his hand, he took out another peach and took a big bite."This kid is beautiful but his murderous aura is too strong. Although he tried his best to hide it, I can still sense it, especially his eyes." Zhang San's expression was somewhat solemn."Have you noticed? That's a pair of eyes with a vengeful personality. It seems that to him, there's nothing he can't kill as long as it conforms to his principles...""It's fine if you use such a person well but if you don't, be careful of backlash. I can faintly sense that many people have died in his hands and he also gives me a very dangerous feeling.""If I encounter them at sea, I definitely won't provoke him easily. I don't want to die." Zhang San looked at the captain of Team Six seriously."An interesting little junior brother." The captain of Team Six smiled as he looked in the direction Xu Qing had gone. It seemed that the more Zhang San said this, the happier he was.Zhang San sighed helplessly at the side, thinking to himself that he had forgotten about this fellow. He was just as abnormal and his actions were incomparably treacherous.While the captain and Zhang San were talking about Xu Qing, Xu Qing was already walking on the streets of the harbor. At that moment, it was almost dusk and the crowd on the streets was slowly thinning. Most of the pharmacies were closed, so Xu Qing returned to his berth.,m After he returned, he didn't immediately take out the magic boat. Instead, he carefully inspected it.Yesterday, someone had come here with killing intent. Hence, when Xu Qing returned today, he did a detailed check and even sprinkled some poison powder into the sea. After confirming that there was nothing wrong, he took out his magic boat and stepped onto it.As the magic boat's protective barrier instantly rose, Xu Qing, who had entered the cabin, felt a little more at ease.After he sat down cross-legged, he didn't cultivate immediately but pondered over everything that had happened today.Xu Qing couldn't see through the captain but he remembered everything he said. His intuition told him that what the other party said should be true.On Zhang San's side, Xu Qing could faintly sense that the other party seemed to be hiding some sort of emotion, as though he was a little afraid of him.There was also the disciple who had lost all his contribution points and couldn't leave on his own. He looked at the sky in despair and was eventually killed.What he saw today made Xu Qing realize that the majority of the disciples who could survive in the savage environment of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city weren't simple. One couldn't just look at the surface.For example, if the captain or Zhang San were to be thrown into the scavenger campsite, they would probably be able to toy with them and take their lives.In Xu Qing's eyes, the entire Seven Blood Eyes was like another forbidden zone. Hence, he needed to work harder in his cultivation.This was especially so when he thought of the young man in the light purple Daoist robe he had seen earlier in the day. The other party was only at the Qi Condensation Realm, but his noble status and the way the people around him lowered their heads caused Xu Qing to feel a familiar difference in their statuses.

Chapter 94 Newbie Of The Homicide Department (2)
He had seen many similar class differences since he was young and knew how to handle them.Also, due to his vigilance, Xu Qing didn't ask the captain about the specific information regarding the person who gave him the token.If the other party wanted to appear, he would naturally appear. If he didn't want to appear, Xu Qing wouldn't force the answer."It shouldn't be because of Grandmaster Bai's care." Xu Qing took a deep breath, closed his eyes and began to cultivate.Two hours later, the sky outside had completely darkened. In the silence, Xu Qing opened his eyes, revealing a hint of hesitation.He could sense that his cultivation speed was much slower than yesterday and he also knew the reason.If his body was compared to a container, then most of the containers yesterday were empty. Hence, he didn't have to expend any effort to absorb more spirit energy. However, now that the container was filled to the brim, he had no choice but to increase his absorption ability during his cultivation to absorb spirit energy from the outside world."Unless I don't have to expend any effort to absorb it and allow spirit energy to flow in. However, this requires the density of spirit energy in the outside world to be high." Xu Qing lowered his head and muttered to himself. After that, his right hand formed a seal and he pointed to the deck at the side.Immediately, wherever he pointed to, rays of light would appear and fill the entire boat. It was like an array formation.At that moment, the array formation was clearly in operation, causing the spirit energy from the outside world to flow over continuously despite being slow. This was also the reason why one's cultivation speed would be faster when cultivating on the magic boat compared to the outside world.This was because this array formation was the Spirit Energy Gathering Array."I have to increase my power source." Xu Qing seemed to be in deep thought. Through the jade slip on the magic boat, he knew that other than the enhancement from biological materials, there was another important point to the boat's improvement.That was the power source.That was the core of a ship. Like a heart, it determined the power of the ship. It could climb endlessly and was the most expensive part of the exchange.At the start, the power source of all the Seventh Peak disciples' spirit boats was only a spirit energy gathering array. They could slowly absorb the spirit energy in the surroundings and store it as a substitute power source.If a disciple felt that the power wasn't enough, they could also place spirit stones on their own to increase the motivation and the might of the array formation.Other than that, the hearts of some powerful mutated beasts were often the best materials for power sources. The stronger the power, the greater the might of the spirit energy gathering array. At the same time, regardless of whether it was the speed of the ship or its defense, they could be released to the greatest extent.Otherwise, if the power source level wasn't high enough, no matter how good the external configuration was, it would be very difficult to unleash its full potential.At the thought of this, Xu Qing gritted his teeth and took out one of the ten spirit stones he had and placed it on the array formation. The next moment, the spirit stone disappeared and Xu Qing's magic boat vibrated.As the light from the array formation dazzled, the spirit boat seemed to have turned into a vortex. The spirit energy was denser than before and was forcefully absorbed from all directions.Xu Qing immediately cultivated. This time around, his cultivation speed was clearly much faster.When dawn broke, Xu Qing abruptly opened his eyes and the purple light in his eyes flickered."Sea Transformation Art, the sixth level!" Xu Qing took a deep breath and sensed the 600-foot-long spirit sea in his body. Although it only seemed to be 100 feet longer than before, this 100-foot-long spirit sea covered way more area and contained an even greater depth.Hence, in terms of quantity, it was much larger. The most important thing was that there were many more species and their might that could be transformed."If this continues, in a few more days, the Sea Transformation Art will be able to reach the same realm as the Mountains and Seas Art." Xu Qing was very satisfied with this speed. The only thing he sighed about was that the consumption of cultivation was too great.In just one night, one spirit stone was used up.At that moment, the sky was already bright outside. Xu Qing tidied himself up and walked out of the magic boat to head to the Homicide Department to begin his work for the next day.Working in the Homicide Department was both a responsibility and a salary. According to the information on the identity token, one would be rewarded with 3,000 contribution points every month. Hence, Xu Qing was very serious. Not long after the sun rose, he arrived at the Homicide Department. He walked all the way to the Black Division and saw the captain and team members of Team Six.There were more than 20 people in the entire team. There were men and women and they all had different appearances. Every one of them had extraordinary cultivation fluctuations. They also saw Xu Qing but most of them were cold and wary of each other.Xu Qing wasn't good at socializing. Hence, he remained silent at the side and maintained a distance from everyone. Very soon, the captain of Team Six walked out of the room lazily while eating an apple."Today's mission is still to go out and search for the remnants of Night Dove.""Therefore, you all shouldn't keep an eye on those wanted criminals. Although there are many rewards, Night Dove is the key to us in the near future. Remember, if you find any clues, don't alert the enemy. When you return, inform the department. The department will arrange for others to investigate the authenticity of the information and make a comprehensive plan.""Now, everyone, get to work!"After the captain finished speaking, the members of Team Six dispersed. This time, the captain didn't bring Xu Qing along. Instead, he gave him a jade slip that recorded the wanted criminals and allowed him to act alone. Xu Qing didn't have any objections to this arrangement, so he quickly left the Homicide Department. He checked the jade slip as he patrolled the city.He didn't know where to patrol, so he imitated what his captain had done yesterday and walked through the port area. He was still vigilant the entire way and even took off his badge. Most of the time, he would appear in dark and inconspicuous locations.In the dark, he looked at the people on the streets who were in a hurry and the various shops that were filled with people. Xu Qing also gained a deeper understanding of the prosperity of the main city.It was only when he saw someone selling candied hawthorns on the way that Xu Qing recalled the yearning he had when he was young. Hence, he went forward and bought a stick of candied hawthorns. After confirming that it was normal, he then ate in the dark while moving forward.  Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé He had finished reading all the wanted criminal's jade slips and understood why the captain had reminded the members of Team Six not to keep targeting the wanted criminal. The rewards inside were extremely generous. The lowest reward was ten spirit stones and the highest reward was several hundred spirit stones.It was late in the morning when it was already noon. Xu Qing, who was eating very slowly and had yet to finish his candied fruits, suddenly stopped and looked at the crowd in the distance.As far as the eye could see, there was a woman in very plain clothes but it couldn't hide her graceful figure. She was skillfully taking two bags from the passing crowd.She seemed to be very confident in her skills. After walking out of the crowd, the corners of this woman's mouth curled up as she revealed a complacent smile. However, when she saw Xu Qing's expressionless face in a corner not far away, her smile froze slightly.Very soon, she put on a shy expression and lowered her head while blushing. She was about to leave when she noticed from the corner of her eyes that Xu Qing was walking toward her.This made her very vigilant but she still couldn't recognize Xu Qing. However, the instinctive sense of danger caused her to quicken her pace and sway, wanting to enter the crowd to avoid him.However, Xu Qing recognized her.This woman was the one who framed him a few nights ago and took the opportunity to escape.This caused him to have no choice but to kill on the first day.Hence, Xu Qing finished the last bite of the candied fruit in his hand. With a swing of his right hand, the bamboo stick instantly shot out like a bolt of lightning, whistling through the air as it headed straight for the woman.It was so fast that the woman's expression changed drastically and she couldn't dodge in time. Before her body could enter the crowd, her right foot was pierced by the bamboo stick. With a bang, her delicate body was pinned to the ground.A blood-curdling scream immediately rang out from the pale-faced woman's mouth. Accompanied by cries for help, the weak-looking woman seemed to have been bullied by a bully. This caused the surrounding crowd to be overwhelmed with horror and quickly dispersed.At the same time, Xu Qing's cold voice entered the ears of the trembling woman."If you shout one more time, I'll tear your mouth apart."Xu Qing's learning and imitation abilities were just as good as his memory√¢¬Ä¬¶

Chapter 95 Giving One Spirit Coin
What happened that night made Xu Qing very angry. He didn't want to kill on the first day he arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes but the other party had forcefully framed him. If it wasn't for the fact that Xu Qing's cultivation and combat strength were sufficient, if it was anyone else, they might have died during the framing that night.Hence, at that moment, his attack was incomparably swift. As his voice rang out, the woman who was screaming suddenly fell silent. Her entire body was trembling but she knew the advantage of being a woman.She also understood that to a man, a frightened woman would more or less cause others to feel pity for her. Hence, she exaggerated her fear.Xu Qing was expressionless. As he chewed on the last candied fruit in his mouth, he walked toward the other party. At the same time, he didn't forget to be vigilant of the surroundings to see if the other party had accomplices. As he walked over, the passersby in the surroundings had already distanced themselves.Even a few cultivators among them wanted to interfere when they saw the miserable state the woman was in. However, after noticing that Xu Qing's aura wasn't ordinary, they quickly dispelled the thought.Seeing Xu Qing walking over, the woman who felt intense pain from having her foot penetrated intentionally trembled even more. Sweat covered her forehead as she recognized Xu Qing's voice.In reality, ever since she framed Xu Qing that day and sensed the other party's gaze as well as the viciousness of his attacks, she had been very vigilant. She was very clear that she had provoked a terrifying existence.Hence, she had been hiding for the past few days and didn't go out. Today, she felt that the limelight should have passed. That terrifying existence most probably left. It shouldn't dare to act rashly during the day.That was why she came out. However, no matter what, she didn't expect to meet the other party.It was fine if she encountered him since she was confident that she could escape. After all, she was a commoner. With the Patrol Department in charge of public security, she was safe under the rules.However, at this moment, as she looked at the figure who squatted down beside her, she suddenly had a feeling that she might die here before the Patrol Department arrived.Hence, she fully displayed the pity she felt as a woman amidst the trembling of her body and the fear in her eyes. She wanted to stall for time."Stop pretending." Xu Qing squatted in front of the woman and removed the bamboo stick from her footboard.The intense pain and the fact that the other party had seen through her thoughts caused the terror in the woman's eyes to become real. She also noticed that the other party was very close to her at this moment. She struggled for a moment in her heart and her clenched right hand moved but she still didn't dare to spill the poison powder in her hand.At that moment, whistling sounds could be heard from the distant streets. A group of patrolling cultivators seemed to have noticed the situation here and were rushing over at high speed.Hope instantly appeared in the woman's eyes.However, very soon, as Xu Qing took out the badge of the Homicide Department, the group of patrolling cultivators turned their heads and left. The hope in the woman's eyes was replaced by despair and she suddenly spoke in a low voice while trembling."What happened last time was my fault. I'm willing to make amends. I... I know a clue about a wanted criminal!"She didn't bargain with Xu Qing. As someone who walked in the dark all year round, she knew very well that she didn't have the qualifications to bargain with someone who was stronger than her and could crush her. Obedience was the only way to survive.Hence, she didn't wait for Xu Qing to speak and quickly revealed the clues."That wanted criminal is the abandoned disciple of the Spirit Cloud Sect, Qing Yunzi. He has been staying at Panquan Road for the past few days, in the inn we met last time.""Wanted criminal?" Xu Qing took out the jade slip his captain had given him. After checking it, he found Qing Yunzi's name. After a glance, the reward was around 20 spirit stones."Also, I heard that your Homicide Department has been investigating the Night Dove. I also know of a Night Dove stronghold." In this huge crisis, the woman had given it her all in order to save her life. She hurriedly continued to speak and told him the location of the stronghold.After Xu Qing heard this, he cast a meaningful glance at the woman and thought of the captain's informant. Hence, he took out a spirit coin and passed it to her."If there are such clues in the future, wait for me here."The woman was stunned and hesitated for a moment. She was very clear about the meaning of this sentence. Very soon, she gritted her teeth and nodded fiercely. She then took the spirit coins and limped away rapidly under Xu Qing's gaze.After the woman's figure disappeared from the crowd, Xu Qing stood up. He didn't verify the authenticity of what the other party said about Night Dove's stronghold. He only needed to report it to the higher-ups and someone would verify it.Hence, after another round of patrolling in the city, Xu Qing went to the inn he stayed at when the sun was setting.During the day, the inn was also open but almost no one entered.Xu Qing swept his gaze from afar and recalled how strange the old man from the inn was. However, he didn't act rashly. Instead, he returned to the Homicide Department and reported the clues he had obtained before leaving.As for whether the woman would agree on the surface and disappear afterward, Xu Qing didn't care. This was because she had accepted the spirit coin and it...was poisonous.Three days later, he needed to detoxify the poison.On the way, he met a few members of Team Six. When they saw Xu Qing, they coldly swept their gazes over him but didn't say anything. Only a middle-aged member laughed and invited Xu Qing to join them for a drink.On the surface, it was forbidden for the Seven Blood Eyes to kill each other but they were secretly plundering each other. Such an invitation was a little abrupt and it made Xu Qing even more vigilant. He calmly rejected it.Today was a special day. He didn't want to kill anyone and wanted to be alone.Also, he planned to make a trip to the medicinal shop.He wanted to buy some medicinal herbs that could be used to refine white pills. After attempting to refine them, he would sell them for money. At the same time, he didn't have much poison and black pills left, so he needed to replenish them. Also, he had even more ideas regarding poison that he wanted to verify. According to the map in his mind, Xu Qing soon found a medical shop.This medical shop was very large and there were many people coming and going. They were all dressed in gray Daoist robes.The disciples of the various peaks needed items like medicinal pills.Xu Qing's entrance attracted the attention of some people due to his handsome appearance. However, most of them only glanced at him. Their expressions wouldn't be obvious.Xu Qing's expression was calm. He also swept his gaze across the crowd in the shop and silently walked toward the counter.At the counter, other than a shopkeeper-like old man, there was also a little fatty.This little fatty had an ordinary appearance. His gray Daoist robe was very tight on his body, making him look round. His fair and chubby face had some freckles, and he looked to be around 16 or 17 years old. He was also a customer.At that moment, he was yawning as he placed the medicinal herbs piled up on the counter into the huge pockets he carried with him.There was no pattern to his movements. Outsiders might not be able to tell but Xu Qing could tell at a glance that the other party didn't understand medicinal herbs.There were some that couldn't be placed together that he casually stuffed into his pocket."Shopkeeper, the amount of medicinal herbs this time is a little low. Is that all?" As Xu Qing got closer, he heard the little fatty's dissatisfied voice."You come here every day and you've bought everything. How about tomorrow? The goods from the boss will arrive tomorrow." The shopkeeper was clearly very familiar with the little fatty. After he took out all the medicinal herbs the other party had bought, he looked at Xu Qing who was walking over."Junior Brother, what medicinal pills do you want?""I need ten-year-old butterfly bone flowers, 30 stalks of golden-winged leaves, 10 stalks of exquisite branches, 10 stalks of seven-leaf grass of any age, and 100 stalks of golden-button grass," Xu Qing calmly said."I also need a rhinoceros fire flower with roots, as well as spirit condensation leaves. Add 10 stalks of white roots to that.""Also, do you have any decomposing cloud soil and black rose thorns?" After some thought, Xu Qing added a few more snake venoms and poisonous grass. After he finished speaking, he looked at the shopkeeper.The shopkeeper's eyes narrowed as he carefully looked at Xu Qing. The people he usually met here were all disciples who bought pills. Occasionally, he would meet some disciples who bought herbs but most of them were from the Second Peak. There were also those like Little Fatty who didn't know anything.As for the youth in front of him, he spoke so clearly and he also looked unfamiliar. It was very rare to see someone who wasn't a cultivator from the Second Peak.This was especially so when the other party's medicinal herbs were mostly used for white pills. This caused the shopkeeper to be lost in thought. He cast a deep glance at Xu Qing before shaking his head."Everything else is available. There's a total of 380 spirit coins but he bought the last 100 portions of spirit condensation leaves. You'll have stock when you come over tomorrow." The shopkeeper pointed at the little fatty who was packing.Xu Qing nodded. Although spirit condensation leaves were important, it didn't matter if it was just one more day. As for the price of the herbs, it was reasonable. If he succeeded, he would be able to refine about a hundred white pills and a few pieces of poison powder.Just when he was about to purchase it, the little fatty at the side lifted his head and surveyed Xu Qing before asking curiously."Spirit Condensation Leaf? You want this thing too? What's the use of this thing? I asked the shopkeeper several times but he didn't tell me.""You ask a lot of questions every time. If I told you every one of them I wouldn't be able to do business with others..." The shopkeeper sighed helplessly.Xu Qing glanced at the little fatty and thought of how he had once thirsted for knowledge as well. Hence, he spoke softly."There are two main uses for spirit condensation leaves. One of them is to catalyze other medicinal herbs, causing them to mutate in the direction they want. The other is to nourish the skin very well."When the little fatty heard this, he came to a realization and generously took out a bunch of spirit condensation leaves. There were about seven to eight stalks and he generously placed them in front of Xu Qing."Thank you, brother. These are for you." After saying that, the little fatty carried the bag and walked out happily. To him, giving some herbs to others was just a trivial matter.Xu Qing was stunned. He hesitated for a moment and was about to refuse but the little fatty had already rushed out of the door. He even took out a jade slip and seemed to be transmitting his voice.The shopkeeper smiled and spoke."This little fatty's name is Huang Yan. He's a disciple of the Seventh Peak and is also an infatuated weirdo. I don't know which female disciple charmed him but he came to my place to buy medicinal herbs for many years. If he continues to buy like this, the money he spent all these years will be enough for him to become my boss. However, this kid isn't simple either. He's so high-profile yet he can still live until now."Xu Qing cast a deep glance in the direction that the little fatty left in but didn't say anything. He then left after purchasing the remaining medicinal herbs in the medicine shop.He returned to his berth and checked that there were no problems as usual. After that, Xu Qing walked into the magic boat and immediately activated the protective barrier. Only when the protective barrier appeared did he heave a sigh of relief.Compared to the outside world, the magic boat gave Xu Qing a greater sense of security. At this moment, he entered the cabin and sat down. He then took out the medicinal herbs he had bought and sorted them into different categories before placing them properly. The formula for the white pills then surfaced in his mind.Although he hadn't managed to gather all the medicinal herbs needed for the white pills previously, Xu Qing didn't slow down in concocting the medicinal pills. Hence, after he had completed the concoction of these medicinal herbs, he pondered for a moment and began to refine them.Time slowly passed and midnight arrived.

Chapter 96 A Person's Birthday
At that moment, the night wind blew and the seawater flowed gently, patting the surroundings of the small boat and squeezing out a lot of grayish-black water foam.It also caused the small boat to sway slightly and emit creaking sounds.In the black tent, Xu Qing was seriously refining pills.As he took out the medicinal herbs one by one, he either plucked the leaves, squeezed the juice, or extracted the stamens. He cooked them skillfully and gradually and there was more and more medicinal liquid in the stone bowl.After checking the ratio and adjusting it, Xu Qing began to put in the seven-leaf grass. Just like that, when midnight arrived, Xu Qing carefully dripped the juice of the spirit condensation leaf into the black medicinal liquid.Waves of ear-piercing sounds rang out as green smoke spread out. Xu Qing waved his sleeve and dispersed it. The medicinal liquid in the stone bowl directly turned into a white semi-solid state and there was a faint stream of light within.It was a one-time success.After a careful inspection, Xu Qing took out these medicinal liquids and kneaded them one by one, turning them into medicinal pills. He then placed them at the side and dried them. Looking at these medicinal pills, his eyes revealed satisfaction."I've finally refined a white pill!"Xu Qing mumbled as scenes of him learning from Grandmaster Bai appeared in his mind. The scene of the scavenger campsite was also reflected in his heart.All of this caused the youth's heart to slowly become restless on this special day.After a long time, Xu Qing sighed softly and looked out of the ship. It was pitch-black.Only the bright moon hanging high above the sea shone brightly.  Latest Chapters at‚Äã ÔΩé0ÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé The surroundings were silent. The sea breeze blew over and there was a hint of shade in the humidity, causing his hair to flutter."Grandmaster Bai should have returned to Purple Earth long ago.""Cross and Luan Tooth, I wonder how they are now‚Ä¶""Also, could there be weeds at Captain Lei's grave‚Ä¶" Xu Qing whispered softly."As for me, I haven't found the heavenfate flower yet."Even though he was used to being alone and had adapted to his new environment, Xu Qing was still a youth after all. He sat there silently and in his memory, he returned to the residence of the scavenger camp and ate snake meat with a familiar old man.He listened to the other party talk about the trivial matters in the scavenger campsite and watched as the other party smoked a pipe and drank wine.The image of the memory was very clear.Xu Qing's eyelids drooped."The teacher in the slums said that when a person starts to recall the past, it means that his age is growing‚Ä¶" Xu Qing muttered and took out a flask of wine from his leather pouch.He had bought this during his patrol during the day.Holding the wine pot, Xu Qing raised his head and looked at the bright moon in the sky. After a long time, he slowly raised it and toasted the bright moon before drinking it in one gulp.From afar, the youth on the boat drank one cup to the bright moon and the other cup to himself.The wine in the main city was even stronger than the scavenger campsite. When it entered his mouth, it was extremely hot. When it fused into his stomach, it was as though there was a flame burning his entire body, causing Xu Qing's breathing to become slightly hurried. After a long time, he drank another large mouthful."I wish Captain Lei a safe journey in heaven.""I wish Grandmaster Bai good health and longevity.""I wish myself‚Ä¶ Happy birthday."Xu Qing mumbled and drank it again.Today was a special day. It was his birthday.Xu Qing, who looked to be 16 or 17 years old, had actually just turned 15. However, compared to his peers who had grown up safely, his experiences forced him to mature.Today, just like every other day for many years, he silently blessed himself.However, this year, there was more alcohol.Hence, after drinking the entire pot, Xu Qing thought of his family.With his memories, even though he tried his best to recall them, they were still blurry. This blurriness made Xu Qing feel very uncomfortable. He didn't want it to be blurry but‚Ä¶ there were some things that couldn't be controlled.A long, long time passed."Are you guys alright‚Ä¶" Xu Qing lowered his head and asked.The sea breeze blew over, lifting his hair and blowing it on his face, scattering everything. That trace of shade also gradually pulled Xu Qing back from his memories, causing his eyes to become sharp again and the expression on his face to become cold again."Live.""If I can live a little better and have the chance to see my parents‚Ä¶ that would be even better.",m "Therefore, I have to become stronger!" Xu Qing slowly lifted his head. The figure of the youth under the moonlight was like a lone wolf as he stared into the distance.After a long time, he turned and walked back to the cabin. He sat cross-legged and began to cultivate. Time passed.After his birthday, Xu Qing's life was on the right track. In the next few days, other than patrolling, he spent his time refining pills and cultivating.Although the cultivation of the Sea Transformation Art was enhanced by spirit stones, his cultivation still gradually slowed down. Now, he had just broken through from the sixth level to the seventh level.The further he went, the slower his cultivation became. However, this was only in comparison. In reality, compared to others, Xu Qing's cultivation speed was already extremely astonishing.At the same time, after reaching the seventh level of the Sea Transformation Art, Xu Qing could clearly sense that his combat strength was almost the difference between heaven and earth. Now, he was 100% confident that he could kill him within thirty breaths of time before he came to Seven Blood Eyes.Although there was still a gap between him and the Diamond Sect's ancestor, Xu Qing was confident that he could deal with him head-on."When I'm stronger, I'll go and kill the Diamond Sect's ancestor." If he didn't kill the Diamond Sect's ancestor, Xu Qing would have a thorn in his heart and would always feel uneasy. He felt that although the other party couldn't personally deal with him because of the Seven Blood Eyes' rules, it was inevitable that he would use others to kill him. Hence, he had to hurry up and increase his cultivation to eliminate this threat.In addition, Xu Qing's research on the magic boat was also extremely thorough. He analyzed the contents of the jade slip very thoroughly. After he completely understood it, his control over the magic boat also reached an extremely agile level.As for the direction, he also made a decision and chose Fortitude!He wanted to start with sturdiness and defense to increase the level of the magic boat. The reason for this was on one hand, it was to increase sturdiness and defense so that it wouldn't be easily depleted. If it wasn't depleted, it meant that there was no need to repair it and the expenditure would be reduced.On the other hand, in this Seven Blood Eyes main city that was filled with danger, the magic boat was Xu Qing's only relatively safe place. He needed such a place to cultivate, rest, and refine pills.Therefore, such a place had to have sufficient protection.At the same time, Xu Qing had also refined quite a number of medicinal pills these few days. This was the case for white pills and black pills.According to his previous method, not only did he refine black pills but he also refined a lot of poison powder that he had used before.Every time he refined pills, Xu Qing would be extremely focused. Herbs and medicine were survival skills that he had learned very seriously back then. He cherished what he had learned and had long engraved it into his bones.As for the remaining medicinal herbs after each refinement, he carefully sorted them out and placed them in the cabin. This caused his small boat to be densely packed with various medicinal herbs.Among them, because there were too many people in the main city, it wasn't convenient for him to try to innovate. Hence, Xu Qing didn't refine a new poison but he had accumulated a lot of materials.He planned to find an opportunity to go out and find a secret place to refine it together.As for the work of the Homicide Department, as Xu Qing continued to head there for a few days, he gradually became familiar with it. Over the past few days, the entire Homicide Department was still searching for Night Dove's stronghold. Every day, a large number of clues would be reported.Xu Qing could sense that the department wasn't far from closing the net.Today wasn't supposed to be his night shift but Xu Qing chose to take the initiative to apply and swap places with someone else.The duty of the Homicide Department included patrolling at night. Every disciple would have their turn. However, every time they were on duty at night, everyone would be extremely vigilant.Hence, when the sky gradually darkened in the outside world, Xu Qing tidied his clothes and placed the poison powder in his sleeve pocket. He then placed the dagger and iron stick down and walked out of the magic boat.Outside, the sun had already set and dusk was about to disperse. The sky was dark and the ground had also lost its light. Drops of rain slowly sprinkled down on the main city.Xu Qing's figure moved in the darkness. In the rain, his entire person seemed to have fused with the night as he sped forward.At that moment, the wind blew over and landed on Xu Qing's long robe, causing it to rustle. This wind was cold and when one took a breath, it would make one feel very refreshed.It also dispersed the heat in the city but it couldn't disperse some special smells in the air.As he sped along, his clean boots stepped on the bluestone tiles that were sprinkled with rain, producing a series of hurried tata sounds. From afar, it seemed that with every step he took, the water stains on the ground would ripple like flowers, as though lotuses would bloom with every step he took.Very soon, the sky turned completely dark and the rain became even heavier. Xu Qing's figure quickly passed through various alleys and closed shops, avoiding some killing scenes. He arrived at Panquan Road at midnight.Looking at the inn in the distance, Xu Qing stood in a corner under the eaves in the rain and waited silently.Many days ago, his informant had mentioned a wanted criminal named Qing Yunzi.The wanted jade slip stated that this person came from a small sect called the Azure Cloud Sect. He was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation and was ruthless and lascivious. In the sect he was from, he killed several female fellow disciples and was chased all the way. He even slaughtered many villages and raped and plundered.However, Xu Qing didn't choose to capture him because he had no feud with him.In this cruel chaotic world, everyone had their own way of living. Xu Qing couldn't care less.However, the other party had done something wrong.Xu Qing's informant should have appeared two days ago at the bustling city where the two of them had met for the second time, looking for him to detoxify the poison. However, she hadn't appeared.Hence, Xu Qing went to search during the day.Although the wind was strong, it couldn't disperse the unique smell of the poison powder on the spirit coins. Hence, Xu Qing easily found the woman's residence and also saw the traces of fighting inside. Following the traces of the poison powder, he found this inn.After waiting for an entire afternoon, he saw someone who was tainted by the strong smell of poison powder enter the inn.The other party's appearance was identical to the wanted jade slip. It was Qing Yunzi.Hence, Xu Qing swapped the night shift with someone else and came here to wait silently.He naturally had to take care of his informant.

Chapter 97 Lonely Night In The Rain (1)
As time passed, the wind and rain grew heavier.The howling wind sounded like it was crying as it reverberated in the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes. It roamed every street and alley, meeting the rain in the sky time and time again and hugging each other.It also landed on the Panquan Road and around Xu Qing.The rain knocked on the bricks at the side, producing a tata sound. The wind wasn't to be outdone either, blowing his long robe and causing it to flutter.As for Xu Qing, who was standing under the roof, it was as though he wouldn't be disturbed by the wind and rain. His entire person melted into the darkness like a hunter, not moving at all as he coldly stared at his prey.He was very patient. His breathing was even and unhurried.Just like that, another two hours passed. When the lights of thousands of households were extinguished, the entire city fell into darkness and silence. Only the rustling of the rain could be heard. In the inn, a figure slowly revealed his head.It was a middle-aged cultivator in a red robe. His body under the robe seemed to be very muscular and his shoulders were extremely wide. Standing there, he gave off an oppressive feeling. It was Qing Yunzi.The spirit energy fluctuations on his body were also very extraordinary. He seemed to have reached the ninth level of Qi Condensation and seemed to be very strong.However, this kind of strength was only relative to small sects and small forces. To the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes, the difference in cultivation techniques had already increased the foundation of both sides. To be able to grow in the cruel environment of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, one only needed to be at the seventh level of Qi Condensation to suppress a ninth level cultivator like him. Hence, this made him very cautious in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city.At that moment, at the inn's door, he first stuck his head out and scanned his surroundings. After confirming that there was no danger, he tried to take a step forward. The instant he stepped out of the inn, his entire body suddenly swayed and he was about to leave in the rainy night.However, after taking less than five steps, Qing Yunzi's expression changed. It was as though he had a talent for identifying danger. Although he didn't see Xu Qing, he seemed to have sensed danger. He suddenly turned around and headed straight for the inn.Xu Qing frowned slightly. He originally planned to wait for the other party to run a little further before attacking. However, the other party's vigilance was too high. At that moment, a cold glint flashed in his eyes as he walked out.His speed was so fast that he was like a bolt of lightning, shuttling through the rain.The falling rain became incomparably slow in front of him. At that moment, a sonic boom rang out in the entire street.As the rain continued to dissipate, Xu Qing's figure was like an arrow that had left the bow, heading straight for Qing Yunzi outside the inn with irresistible force.Qing Yunzi's expression changed drastically. He saw Xu Qing and sensed the terrifying speed. He also sensed the aura of the forbidden sea from the spirit energy in the other party's body, suppressing his entire body and causing his spirit energy to stop circulating. His heart instantly trembled violently as a life-and-death crisis erupted at this moment.  please visit n(0)ve1b(in).ne)t  His eyes instantly turned red. He bit the tip of his tongue and seemed to have activated a secret technique. He forcefully circulated his cultivation and caused his speed to increase explosively. He was about to rush into the inn's door.At that moment, the old man smoking a pipe appeared at the entrance of the inn. Under the illumination of the fireworks, he looked at Xu Qing who was rushing over.In the next instant, Qing Yunzi's eyes were bloodshot and he was only half a step away from the inn's entrance. Just as he lifted his right foot and was about to step in, a black light approached at an even faster speed. With a cold light and dense sea-restricting spirit energy, it broke through Qing Yunzi's cultivation protection and suddenly passed through his raised right calf.The speed and impact were so fast that Qing Yunzi let out a miserable cry in the silent night.He couldn't land his right foot and his body was knocked to the side by the impact. As he staggered, he found it difficult to steady himself. When he had no choice but to take a step back, a second black light whistled over. It was a dagger.There was a bang.The speed of this dagger was astonishing. In an instant, it pierced into Qing Yunzi's left arm. Terrifying spirit energy erupted in his body. As it destroyed his meridians, it ruthlessly nailed his body to the ground. His face landed on the ground and he was only an arm's length away from the inn's entrance.As he screamed, the veins on Qing Yunzi's forehead bulged. He struggled to pull out his dagger and crawl toward the inn but it was too late. Xu Qing's figure had already closed in and he stepped on Qing Yunzi's back.This kick was extremely powerful. With a crack, the spine on his back broke. The intense pain caused Qing Yunzi's entire body to tremble violently and his screams became even more miserable.Amidst his misery, the old man in the inn put down the pipe in his hand. At that moment, he seemed to emit a dangerous aura as he coldly looked at Xu Qing who had appeared at the door."Are you going to break my rules?"His two eyes had turned yellow. One could see tentacles burrowing out from them and cracks appeared between his brows. It was as though there was something in his body that was about to crawl out. It was a shocking sight.At the same time, in his inn, a strange sound rang out. A huge python as thick as three people actually hung down from the roof beam of the inn. Its vertical pupils revealed coldness and bloodlust as it stared at Xu Qing.Not only that but a large number of centipedes also crawled out from the ground. All of them were incomparably pitch-black and contained extreme poison. They all assumed an attacking posture and sharp auras spread out from the surrounding houses. When they locked onto Xu Qing, ropes hung down from the roof.These ropes seemed to have a life of their own. At this moment, they were spinning slightly, as though they could wrap around Xu Qing in the next instant. An endless aura of death exuded from them, as though countless people had died on these ropes.They were staring at Xu Qing.Xu Qing stood at the door and stepped on the back of the person who was screaming. He then raised his head and looked at the old man in the inn.

Chapter 98 Lonely Night In The Rain (2)
Their gazes met.Xu Qing didn't seem to notice the mutated beasts in the inn, the auras from the surroundings, or the ropes. He only looked at the old man.The shadow behind him transformed into a pitch-black ghost that was ready to attack.At the same time, Xu Qing circulated the Mountains and Seas Art at full force. Every single part of his flesh and blood was prepared to completely erupt at this moment.The Sea Transformation Art was the same. The rain in the surroundings stopped in midair at this moment and surrounded Xu Qing, resonating with the spirit sea in his body.It seemed like he could form a killing technique at any time.It was the same for the poison and his shadow. At that moment, it was silent and undetectable. It had already spread to the inn and reached the feet of the strange old man.This was especially so when an illusory long saber surrounded by water droplets appeared above his head. It was faintly discernible and seemed to contain vast might. Now that it was compressed, it could slash the ground like a heavenly saber at any time.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and looked at the old man in front of him. He wasn't intimidated by the tentacles in his eyes and his forehead that was about to split open. He knew that the other party was very strong but he also had a way to escape unscathed. Hence, his expression was calm as he spoke seriously."He didn't step in. It's not considered breaking the rules."The old man's eyes flickered with a dark light. After staring at Xu Qing for a long time, he suddenly smiled."You have a point."The moment he smiled and his words echoed, all the auras that were locked onto Xu Qing outside the inn instantly disappeared. The pythons in the inn also retreated into the roof beams. The centipedes on the ground rustled and dissipated into the ground.As for the ropes, they were also blurry and soon disappeared. As for the old man himself, the tentacles in his eyes and the crack on his forehead disappeared completely. He returned to his ordinary-looking old man appearance and picked up the pipe to smoke."Are you selling the corpse?"Xu Qing shook his head and grabbed Qing Yunzi's hair. As the other party trembled, he spoke calmly:"Where's the woman you captured two days ago?"Qing Yunzi's hair was disheveled and his face was covered in blood. He was in an extremely sorry state.At that moment, he was trembling. However, he seemed to want to be stubborn and wanted to vomit blood at Xu Qing. However, Xu Qing pressed his head to the ground and wiped it seriously.When the screams became even more mournful, Xu Qing raised his hand and pressed it on Qing Yunzi's right arm, crushing all the bones bit by bit. He then switched to his other arm. This intense pain caused Qing Yunzi to tremble and he couldn't cry out.Xu Qing's expression was calm as he carefully checked. He then punched Qing Yunzi's dantian and destroyed his cultivation. After confirming that the other party was no longer a threat, he stood up and kept his dagger and black iron stick. He then grabbed Qing Yunzi's leg with one hand and dragged him forward.When his flesh and blood touched the ground, even with the rain as a buffer, the feeling of his flesh slowly shattering and rolling caused Qing Yunzi's screams to become even sharper.As Xu Qing moved forward, the screams continued. A trail of blood slowly appeared on the ground. Although it was rapidly washed away by the rain, traces could still be seen.This scene caused the old man's eyes to narrow fiercely. He looked at the youth who left in the rainy night and listened to Qing Yunzi's inhuman screams. After a long time, he muttered.‚Äã "This kid is ruthless..." p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Just like that, Qing Yunzi's screams continued all the way. When everyone who was walking in the dark saw this scene, their hearts trembled. They had an extremely deep impression of the expressionless youth. Even some of the patrolling disciples rushed over when they heard the commotion. After seeing it, they recognized Qing Yunzi's identity and their expressions changed as they looked at Xu Qing.To be able to kill or capture alive or torture someone at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, although he was only a miscellaneous cultivator from a small sect, was impressive. From this, one could see his combat strength and ruthlessness. No one was willing to rashly provoke such a person.This battle allowed Xu Qing to gain some fame in the main city.As for Qing Yunzi, after persisting for two hours, he completely lost his will. While he was unconscious, he told Xu Qing a location and also told Xu Qing about the secret of that informant.That informant was actually a spy raised by Qing Yunzi. He didn't know that the other party had told Xu Qing about his whereabouts but he had a habit. Any spy would cripple him after some time.This time, it was the spy's turn.According to the address provided by Qing Yunzi, after Xu Qing went there, he carefully checked to ensure that there were no ambushes before he truly stepped in. Finally, he saw the informant who was on the verge of death in a sealed dungeon that was mixed with countless smelly auras.After losing the spirit coins, the smell of the remaining poison powder on his body was mixed up. Moreover, it was sealed in this sealed place, so Xu Qing couldn't find it.However, she wasn't dead yet. She was surrounded by rotting corpses. There were men and women.The way these people died was extremely miserable. Clearly, they had been cruelly tortured when they were alive. Moreover, there seemed to be an array formation drawn on the ground, as though their deaths were some kind of ritual.Xu Qing's arrival caused this informant to weakly open her eyes. When she saw the unconscious Qing Yunzi at the side, she suddenly had the strength to go crazy. She didn't care that Xu Qing was at the side and pounced on him like a wild beast, biting him until the unconscious Qing Yunzi woke up. He let out a shrill cry and in the end, she bit Qing Yunzi's neck again and again.It was only when Qing Yunzi's body was badly mangled and his body convulsed that he stopped breathing. Only then did she stand there in a daze. She instinctively lifted her head and looked at the expressionless Xu Qing.In her eyes, Xu Qing, who was dressed in a gray robe, had a tall and straight figure. His handsome face revealed a coldness that was difficult for her to grasp. The aura he emitted also made her feel a little suffocated.Hence, the madness on her face was slowly suppressed. After she calmed down, she gradually revealed an obedient expression under Xu Qing's gaze. Her body instinctively trembled as she seemed to have thought of something and hurriedly rummaged through the room.In the end, she found a jade slip and lifted her head to look at Xu Qing. She then slowly knelt down and handed it to Xu Qing with both hands as though she was submitting.Xu Qing took the jade slip. There was an evil array recorded in it. It described that after the ritual was activated, an inconceivable power would descend.However, the conditions to activate this array formation required the emotions of living beings, including joy, anger, sorrow, and other extreme emotions.He silently looked at the miserable state of the human world in the dungeon. After a long silence, Xu Qing dragged Qing Yunzi's corpse and left. Before he left, his voice echoed in the woman's ears."You have to be my informant seriously in the future."Following the voice was another spirit coin and an antidote.The woman took the spirit coins and antidote and stared blankly at the departing Xu Qing. His back view was gradually engraved in her soul as she lowered her head and agreed.At that moment, it wasn't far from dawn outside. Xu Qing took out a black paper umbrella and dragged Qing Yunzi's broken corpse along the streets silently.The layers of clouds in the sky seemed to reflect some of his emotions. After he sent Qing Yunzi's corpse back to the department and left under the shock of his colleagues, Xu Qing looked at the rising sun in the sky and the remnant face of the gods in the distance. His eyes revealed tenacity."In this cruel chaotic world, only by becoming stronger can we avoid... becoming meat on someone's chopping block!"

Chapter 99 Don't Enter Unless You're Invited
Heavenly lightning exploded!A rumbling sound echoed through the world. The layers of clouds in the sky were thick and heavy, as though there were living beings from outer space constantly bombarding each other.Sometimes, there was a muffled thunder and sometimes, there was a series of loud bangs, causing all the residents in the main city to wake up from their sleep.Bolts of lightning tore through the sky and shockingly tore through the night. The sun that was covered by the clouds seemed to have a chance to catch its breath at this moment. It tried its best to bring the light along with the rain and surge towards the human world.In the morning, the rain was even heavier.The wind outside was also much more violent than at night. It was like the roar of a giant that spread in all directions, as though it was fighting against the lightning in the sky. It echoed in the sky and didn't dissipate for a long time.On the street in the rain, the figure moving under the black paper umbrella gradually blurred.One could only see the rain pouring down outside the umbrella. As for the part that hit the umbrella paper, it let out crackling sounds. At the same time, it seemed like the mission wasn't completed and it wasn't willing to be blocked. Hence, it flowed along the edge of the umbrella and turned into rain.They scrambled to land and gathered together with their companions on the ground.The ripples formed by their reunion completely washed away the blood on the ground last night but it couldn't wash away the sins of humanity in this cruel world."Everyone's heart is locked with sin. It's just that the chaotic era made this lock very easy to open." This was what Captain Lei said with emotion during a meal.Xu Qing felt that it made sense.The rain became more and more ferocious and the heavenly lightning rumbled more and more. Xu Qing's emotions slowly calmed down under the roar of the heavenly lightning and wind.Unknowingly, he returned to Port 79. On the violently churning sea, he habitually checked and put down his magic boat.After stepping in, as the protective barrier rose and the magic boat swayed greatly, Xu Qing sat cross-legged in the black tent.The activation of the protective barrier prevented the rain from falling. As for the swaying ship, Xu Qing, who had already adapted to all of this, didn't feel any discomfort.On the contrary, under the shaking, the rumbling outside and the rain that filled the sky, his heart became increasingly calm. He lowered his head and began to refine pills.During this period of time, Xu Qing had gone to the medicine shop many times to buy medicinal herbs. The number of white pills he refined also increased. Not only that but the number of black pills and poison powder also rose.As for the small compartments in his black-canopied cabin, there were also more of them. In the dense crowd, one could see a large number of medical herbs and evil herbs."I have to find a time to go out and search for a place to refine poison." Xu Qing swept his gaze across those small squares. He then raised his right hand and grabbed. A bunch of medicinal herbs flew over and he continued refining amidst the wind and rain in the outside world.Just like that, time slowly flowed by. During the entire day, the rain became heavier and heavier, as though it was about to turn into a storm that would set off astonishing waves.Countless waves crashed onto the shore of the port, causing a large number of boats to shake violently. Fortunately, the boats in the port were all magic boats. After the protective barrier was activated, they could resist the waves. However, from afar, they were like fallen leaves on the surface of the sea, constantly swaying.It was also because the wind and rain were so heavy that there were no foreign boats entering the port, let alone those who went out. Hence, most of the departments stopped operations and the disciples also stayed in their respective residences.The entire Seven Blood Eyes Port District stopped operating in this increasingly shocking storm.Only the killing‚Ä¶ was still ongoing.When the next night arrived, when the wind and rain in the outside world became even stronger and the heavenly lightning completely fused into the wind, Xu Qing suddenly opened his eyes from the cabin of the magic boat that was shaking violently.A sense of danger surfaced in his mind.This crisis didn't come from the weather outside but from the shore outside the boat.Although the wind and rain were violent and blew away many of the poisonous powder that Xu Qing had set up in the surroundings, there was always the aura of some poisonous powder that could last longer in the wind and rain. This was the first warning Xu Qing had prepared for himself.Once someone got close and was tainted by the aura of his poison powder, if they stepped onto his magic boat, they would fuse with the other poisonous gasses that Xu Qing had set up in the magic boat and turn them into fatal poison.Other than that, the increase in his mental strength during the entry test and the continuous improvement in the Sea Transformation Art during this period of time had caused his perception to far surpass his peers and be even sharper.Hence, under this double vigilance, Xu Qing knew that outside‚Ä¶ someone was approaching. Furthermore, this person was outside the magic boat.The cold glint in Xu Qing's eyes was restrained. He didn't wait in the magic boat but directly walked out of the cabin. He stood on the deck and looked at the outside world from within the protective barrier.Outside, the wind and rain were heavy and lightning flashed. On the shore of his berth, a figure in a raincoat stood with a wine flask in his hand.He looked at Xu Qing and Xu Qing looked back at him.After a long time, the figure in the raincoat lifted his bamboo hat slightly, revealing a middle-aged face. He then smiled at Xu Qing. "Junior Brother Xu, you don't have to be so vigilant. It's me. I went out to buy wine and passed by here. I wanted to ask if you want to drink together? In this damn weather, wouldn't it be better to drink together?"This person was a disciple of the Homicide Department and was in the same team as Xu Qing. One day, he even invited Xu Qing to drink.Xu Qing didn't speak and coldly looked at the middle-aged cultivator in front of him.Seeing Xu Qing like this, the middle-aged cultivator smiled helplessly. please visit n0ve1bin)(.)n(e)t  "Forget it. The environment of this damn sect makes it difficult for people to trust each other but I don't have any ill intentions. Junior Brother Xu, I just want to make friends with you. Many people in the team have drunk my wine. Since you don't like it, I'll take my leave."The middle-aged cultivator shook his head and turned to leave.However, at that moment, Xu Qing suddenly spoke:"Alright, get on the boat."The middle-aged cultivator stopped in his tracks and looked at Xu Qing in surprise before looking at his boat. A dark glint flashed in the depths of his eyes before he shook his head again."Forget it, I won't force others."As he spoke, his footsteps quickened. However, he had just taken five to six steps when a sharp whistling sound suddenly sounded. A dagger broke through the wind and rain at an astonishing speed and headed straight for him.In an instant, the middle-aged cultivator moved his body to dodge. His expression changed and he was about to turn back when Xu Qing's figure rushed out of the magic boat. With the black iron stick in his hand, he rushed over in the wind and rain."Junior Brother Xu, what are you doing?"The middle-aged cultivator's eyes narrowed and he hurriedly retreated. He formed a hand seal with one hand and the rainwater in the surroundings instantly stopped. They then whistled toward Xu Qing. However, before they could get close, Xu Qing waved his hand and the rainwater that was approaching him instantly trembled. Xu Qing actually controlled it and changed its direction, shooting it at the middle-aged cultivator.This scene caused the middle-aged cultivator's heart to tremble as he felt an intense sense of danger. He hurriedly bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood, forming a blood mist that spread out to resist the incoming rain arrows. His body suddenly retreated, wanting to escape.However, it was still too late. He had misjudged Xu Qing's cultivation. In an instant, Xu Qing's figure was like a hot knife through butter as he directly approached. The iron stick in his hand shone brightly as lightning flashed past, emitting a cold light that headed straight for his forehead.The chill was bone-chilling.The middle-aged cultivator's eyes turned red as he let out a loud roar. His cultivation erupted completely and several layers of protective light barriers instantly appeared around his body. A sinister-looking bloody mouth also rapidly appeared on his chest, tearing through his clothes as it let out a sharp roar and charged towards Xu Qing.With a boom, several layers of light barriers collapsed. However, the black iron stick was still slightly paused by the impact of the sound waves from the ferocious mouth on the other party's chest.Taking advantage of this time, the middle-aged cultivator waved his right hand and the wine pot in his hand headed straight for Xu Qing. His body then erupted with all his might as he unleashed his speed to escape.As soon as the wine pot appeared, it automatically shattered in midair. What was contained in it wasn't wine but dense venom. As it exploded and spread in all directions, it carried intense corrosion, as though the magic boat's protective barrier could instantly melt.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. Previously, he had sensed that something was amiss but he wasn't sure. However, on this stormy night, the other party's arrival was already strange. Hence, under his vigilance, Xu Qing decided to make the first move.At that moment, killing intent flashed in his eyes. He raised his head and looked at the fleeing middle-aged cultivator. He didn't chase after him but raised his right hand and grabbed fiercely at him.The Sea Transformation Art in his body erupted.Immediately, the rainwater in the surroundings trembled and gathered crazily towards the middle-aged cultivator. It vaguely transformed into a large hand formed by the rainwater. No matter how the middle-aged cultivator struggled and was shocked, it was useless. He grabbed fiercely.There was a boom.The middle-aged man's body was frozen by the large hand for a long time. His face was pale and fear appeared in his eyes. Just as he was about to speak, Xu Qing's figure had already whistled over. He instantly arrived and the dagger in his right hand slashed across the middle-aged cultivator's neck. The force was so great that his head flew up.As blood splattered everywhere, the large mouth on the middle-aged cultivator's chest suddenly bulged out and bit fiercely at Xu Qing's right hand.Xu Qing suddenly circulated the Mountains and Seas Art in his body. The kui shadow materialized on his arm and he roared silently at the huge mouth, resisting it directly. There was also a huge hand that formed from the surrounding rain that suddenly crushed down forcefully.With a loud bang, the headless corpse of the middle-aged cultivator collapsed, turning into flesh and blood. The large mouth on his chest also shattered into pieces. Only Xu Qing stood on the spot, his chest heaving slightly.This battle seemed fast but in reality, this middle-aged man's cultivation wasn't ordinary. His combat strength was very astonishing and was comparable to Xu Qing's strength before he entered the sect.Even Qing Yunzi, who was killed by Xu Qing yesterday, was far from being a match for this person. After all, the Seven Blood Eyes' Sea Transformation Art cultivator's combat strength far surpassed that of the other small sects.At that moment, Xu Qing quickly scanned his surroundings, searching for any accomplices. In the wind and rain, the entire harbor was pitch-black. Only the violence of the wind and the light from the lightning could be seen.

Chapter 100 Beautiful Figure Under The Umbrella (1)
After checking the surroundings, Xu Qing lowered his head and picked up the middle-aged cultivator's blood-stained bag. He then scattered the corpse-destroying powder on the corpse. Under the washing of the rain, the mangled corpse that had its flesh and blood crumbling turned into blood water that fused with the accumulated rain on the ground.After doing this, Xu Qing returned to the magic boat and sat cross-legged in the cabin. He opened the other party's pocket and frowned after sweeping through it. Other than some miscellaneous items, there were no spirit stones or cultivation resources in this pocket.He didn't have a magic boat either. There was only a blood-colored jade slip and an identity token. However, as this person died, the identity token lost its luster. Xu Qing couldn't see the exact number of contribution points inside and couldn't transfer them.This item required one to take the initiative."His items should have been placed elsewhere√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨¬¶" Xu Qing sighed. Previously, when he attacked, he was used to killing. It was very difficult for the other party to transfer his contribution points over."Next time, if there's a chance, I have to heavily injure them first?" Xu Qing thought about it and still felt that this wasn't safe. Hence, he picked up the blood-colored jade slip and after checking it, his eyes suddenly lit up."Wanted?" This wasn't a normal wanted jade slip. It was more like a private release. There was a series of character information inside. They were all disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes and the price was even marked at the back.One of them was labeled with Xu Qing's name and even pointed out his nickname in the scavenger camp. The price at the back was 50 spirit stones."The Diamond Sect's ancestor!" A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. To be able to know his information and offer a reward of 50 spirit stones, the person could only be the Diamond Sect's ancestor.Clearly, the other party had already found his traces and found information about him in the Seven Blood Eyes.After all, although Antler City was a branch of the Seven Blood Eyes, the Diamond Sect also had connections in that area. It wasn't too difficult to find them."For the Diamond Sect's ancestor to know this information so quickly, it means that he has a certain amount of connections in the Seven Blood Eyes.""However, due to the rules of the Seven Blood Eyes, he didn't dare to do it himself, so he issued a bounty!"Xu Qing pondered and looked at the blood-colored jade slip. After some manipulation, he simply accepted the mission to kill himself."I have to hurry up and cultivate. Then, I have to kill the Diamond Sect's ancestor as soon as possible!"In the blink of an eye, several days passed.This rain lasted for four days.On the third day, it turned into a huge storm, raising huge waves that seemed to want to sweep through the entire harbor.However, under the suppression of the main city's array formation, no matter how astonishing the storm was, the harbor was like a boulder and didn't move at all. On the morning of the fifth day, the storm that couldn't wreak havoc reluctantly chose to retreat and the wind and rain gradually lessened.Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the sky outside. Although it was early in the morning, the sky was gray and filled with oppression. He tidied up his medicinal pills and walked out of the magic boat. Just as he stepped onto the shore, the stench of the sea filled the air in the wind and rain outside. There was also a faint blood intent mixed in, faintly discernible.Although a storm had been brewing in the past four days, to the Homicide Department, it didn't matter if it was rain or shine. However, apart from searching for clues about Night Dove, there was another job every day.That was to capture criminals.In the Seven Blood Eyes, every time a storm arrived, due to the harsh weather and the shutdown of the various departments, coupled with the fact that most cultivators didn't go out, the plundering and killing of each other in the dark would skyrocket. please visit n0ve1bin)(.)n(e)t  In just four days, according to the statistics obtained by the Seventh Peak's Homicide Department, there were a total of more than 80 disciples who died in the port area. Among them, seven disciples of the Homicide Department died.As for the number of deaths in the other six districts, outsiders didn't know but it was obvious that it couldn't be much less.In a storm, it was very difficult to find any clues. Moreover, such matters weren't considered much in the Seven Blood Eyes and wouldn't attract much attention. The Homicide Department was also used to it and only investigated on the surface.Even though an old member of Team Six had died, no one asked about it.Over the past few days, Xu Qing had also found an opportunity to ask the captain about the old man from the inn on Panquan Road. He was told that the other party wasn't a human and had used his relationship with the First Peak to obtain the right to stay in the main city.It was usually peaceful. As for the hidden filth in the inn, on account of the First Peak, as long as they didn't cross the line, the Homicide Department wouldn't care much.Because of this, Xu Qing knew that the human race wasn't the only race in this world. There were also many non-human races. However, he had only seen the old man from the inn once, so he kept this matter in his heart.At that moment, after he went to the police station to pick his targets, Xu Qing held an umbrella and walked on the streets.He planned to make a trip to the medicine shop and sell the white pills he had refined these few days in exchange for more medicinal herbs. It was also because he had a large number of white pills on him that Xu Qing's vigilance became even stronger.Perhaps it was because the rain had lessened but there were more people in the city today than a few days ago. Under Xu Qing's vigilance, not long later, he arrived at the medicinal shop he often went to.There weren't many people in the shop but Xu Qing saw a familiar figure. It was Zhou Qingpeng, who had entered the sect in the same batch as him.Zhou Qingpeng also saw Xu Qing. He hesitated for a moment but didn't recognize him immediately. He only felt that the person in front of him was a little familiar. After all, Xu Qing was covered in dirty scavenger clothes during the test that day.Xu Qing didn't say anything. The old shopkeeper at the side smiled when he saw him enter. He had a deep impression of Xu Qing. After all, he wasn't a disciple of the Second Peak but he knew so much about medicinal herbs. That was rare."You came at the right time. I have something good here today." The shopkeeper smiled and took out a secret leather bag from behind him. After opening it, five dried-up blue insect corpses were revealed.
