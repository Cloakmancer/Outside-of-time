This was caused by the suppression of his aura. At the same time, his body was telling Xu Qing that it was ready to attack."If I can obtain the skin of a Foundation Building sea lizard, this trip would be extremely fruitful. Moreover, the profit is enough to support the advancement of both my magic boat and my own cultivation. I won't have to worry about spirit stones for some time!"A cold glint rose in Xu Qing's eyes.The sea lizard skins he had obtained previously added up to about 2,000 spirit stones. Including the items on the people he killed and Senior Sister Ding's inquiries on the way, his gains now reached about 4,000 spirit stones."Get a Foundation Building sea lizard skin and leave this place!"The moment Xu Qing made up his mind, a loud bang rang out from the foot of the mountain. The three Foundation Building sea lizards were already approaching the top of the mountain.They didn't choose to fly. Instead, they charged forward recklessly, making use of the broken trees to make it easier for them to shed their skin.They directly rushed to the top of the mountain. Ignoring everyone, they then strode into the basin amidst the rumbling sounds of their footsteps.Because their bodies were too large, when the three of them were in the basin together, they instantly occupied more than half of the basin. Observing the Foundation Building creatures at such a close distance caused all the cultivators here to feel as though their breathing was about to stop.Shortly after, they roared at the sky. The roars of the three Foundation Building sea lizards contained lethality.  n0vel online free at ùì∑0ùìøùìÆùìµùì´ùì≤ùì∑ As the sound spread out, it was as though the world was rumbling. The impact formed by the sound waves directly swept in all directions.Some cultivators, whose bodies weren't strong enough or couldn't dodge in time, trembled fiercely and spat out a large mouthful of blood.The surrounding trees couldn't withstand the sound waves and were all shattered.The roars of the three Foundation Building sea lizards continued to spread in all directions, causing the nearby mountains to be affected as well. Trees were destroyed, and some people with low cultivation levels didn't even have a chance to escape. One by one, they screamed and fell.Xu Qing's body also trembled intensely but his body was strong enough. He wasn't too affected by the sound waves but the tree beneath him was reduced to dust.Xu Qing landed on the ground with no care about the destruction of the tree. He stared at the basin like an eagle, waiting for the moment when the molting was completed. As for the old man from Panquan Road, he was also completely focused. The Sea Ghost in the surroundings and the nonhuman race cultivators who had withstood the sound waves were all the same.Just like that, as everyone waited, the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed. Among the three Foundation Building sea lizards in the basin, two mid-stage Foundation Building sea lizards completed their molting after some difficulty.The moment the lizard molts landed, amidst everyone's pained gazes, they bit off a large piece of their lizard molt and swallowed it. Only then did they jump up and directly rise into the air from the basin, letting out a low roar.Although the shed skins had large portions missing, they were still filled with bizarreness. They actually shrank on their own and became the size of a palm in the blink of an eye.At this moment, more than ten Sea Ghost members rushed out. The other rogue cultivators and nonhumans in the surroundings were the same. No one cared about the threat that the Sea Ghost had once posed. The huge benefits were enough to make their eyes red with greed.The old man from Panquan Road was the same. He charged forward fiercely.Xu Qing was even faster. In an instant, other than the Litu Sect who didn't move, all the cultivators here rushed over.There were more than ten people fighting over the two Foundation Building sea lizard skins. Xu Qing chose the one closest to him. It was the same for the old man from Panquan Road. Although the two of them didn't like each other, they still chose to join forces to a certain extent. Of course, they were still vigilant against each other.The two of them instantly approached the lizard skin along with other competitors and the killing intent erupted.Xu Qing circulated all his cultivation base and with a wave of his hand, droplets of water spread out in all directions. He even took out his dagger and brandished it coldly, clashing against a nonhuman cultivator from the Sea Ghost Organization.This cultivator from the Sea Ghost Organization had a cultivation base at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm and was very powerful. However, Xu Qing was stronger. He clenched his left hand into a fist and punched the other party's chest. The Ba shadow behind him roared and suppressed the enemy.The nonhuman cultivator let out a low roar as he counterattacked. He even took out a talisman. However, he still suffered injuries and spat out blood. The talisman almost collapsed and his body was knocked back by 70 to 80 feet.The old man from Panquan Road was equally ferocious. Ropes suddenly appeared around his body and all the rogue cultivators and nonhumans who were fighting with him were instantly bound by the ropes. Some of them even extended toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing knocked back several of them in a row and was about to grab the lizard's skin when the ropes in the surroundings instantly wrapped around him. However, Xu Qing was already prepared. He let out a cold snort and the qi and blood in his entire body spread out.With a boom, all the ropes around him shattered. Just as his hand was about to grab the lizard skin, four cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization rushed toward him with reddened eyes. All of them performed hand seals and activated lethal spells.The old man from Panquan Road was also surrounded and stopped by rogue cultivators.There were also two Sea Ghost cultivators who went straight for the lizard skin. Just when they were about to succeed, the void beside the lizard skin suddenly distorted and a huge snake head appeared in the air. It directly held the skin in its mouth.Its expression seemed to be filled with excitement. The giant snake looked at Xu Qing and the old man and was about to go help Xu Qing‚Ä¶ However, the old man's eyes lit up and he laughed loudly. A runic treasure light appeared around his body, forcing everyone back as he headed straight for the giant snake.After hugging it, the old man said with excitement."Good girl, well done."The Ba shadow behind Xu Qing roared and the sea of fire scattered in all directions, causing the few Sea Ghost cultivators beside him to scream and vomit blood as they retreated. Xu Qing didn't bother with them and turned to look at the old man. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he rushed over.However, at this moment, the thousand-foot-long sea lizard in the basin that no one had dared to disturb roared at the sky.The lizard skin on its body directly split open and its new body crawled out. It seemed to have no time to devour its lizard skin as it headed straight for the sky immediately.Its blood and qi continued to swell, as though it was about to surpass Foundation Building!!The aftershock of the roar spread out like a violent wind, causing everyone's minds to be in turmoil. While many of the cultivators were bleeding from their seven orifices from the shock, the lizard skin of the late-stage Foundation Building sea lizard suddenly shrunk and split into three pieces that scattered around.The aura emitted by these three lizard molts was astonishing, far surpassing the two from before. There was even a faint golden glow on them.As soon as this golden light appeared, rumbling sounds rang out in all directions. Even the clouds surged on their own and a hint of divinity spread out, giving Xu Qing the feeling that it was the same as when he entered the Seven Blood Eyes and faced the pressure test of the divine creature's blood!"This‚Ä¶ I misjudged. This late-stage Foundation Building lizard actually has a trace of divinity in its body. This lizard's molts contain the aura of divinity, and its value is much higher!!" The old man's eyes were wide open as he exclaimed involuntarily.Right at this moment, everyone from the Litu Sect opened their eyes, revealing a cold glint. They were waiting for these!

Chapter 152 Killing And Stealing Treasures
According to the scale of the Litu Sect's forces, it was unlikely that they were mobilizing in small teams for spirit stones. After all, to them, something like desire had already been sacrificed to their mission.They had come here for a mission, and the mission assigned to them by the sect was to obtain this lizard skin that contained a trace of divinity!The instant they saw the appearance of the lizard skin, the eight people from the Litu Sect suddenly stood up. A murderous aura erupted from them and every one of them emitted the fluctuations of the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, heading straight for the basin.Their speed was extremely fast.What was even more shocking was that although they looked like eight people, they were moving like one. Even their footsteps were synchronized with no flaws. They were like eight sharp blades that were stabbing at once.Some rogue cultivators in their way didn't have time to dodge at all. The instant they were touched, they were like plants under a flood, instantly destroyed.The strength of the Litu Sect caused the eyes of the Sea Ghost who had been watching them to erupt with cold light.Previously, when they were fighting for the two mid-stage Foundation Building lizard skins, the Sea Ghost had only dispatched ten people. There were still seven to eight who stayed behind. At this moment, these seven to eight cultivators rushed out at the same time, and the fluctuations they emitted were all at the great circle of perfection.This was especially so for the burly dude with the face of an evil ghost on his chest. The fluctuations from his body surpassed the others and there was a faint hint of Foundation Building.The two sides instantly clashed in the basin. Amidst the rumbling sounds, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. His cultivation base rotated in full speed as he rushed over as well.Although the lizard skin from before had been taken away by the old man from Panquan Road, Xu Qing didn't care too much, that was if the other party didn't return to the Seven Blood Eyes.Otherwise, if the old man returned and wanted to devour the portion that belonged to him, then‚Ä¶ he would make that old man spit it out with interest.Hence, Xu Qing directly ignored the old man and didn't even say a word. His speed created whistling sounds as he approached the place where the Litu Sect and Sea Ghost were fighting. He clenched his fists and the blood and qi in his body moved explosively.The Ba shadow behind him was unprecedentedly clear. Its tall body and cracked surface seemed to contain the red light emitted by magma.Also, the extremely violent aura that surpassed Qi Condensation allowed Xu Qing's two punches to possess strength that went beyond Qi Condensation Realm.Boom!One punch hit the Litu Sect and the other hit the Sea Ghost.Xu Qing had gone all out and unleashed his full combat strength. The might of his punches caused the entire basin to rumble intensely and even create a storm.In this storm, the expressions of everyone from the Sea Ghost changed. The eight people from the Litu Sect also retreated and fiercely looked at Xu Qing."You're courting death!""Seven Blood Eyes‚Ä¶"The Litu Sect and the Sea Ghost Organization attacked at the same time. They fought against each other while also splitting some of their strength to suppress Xu Qing, not allowing him to snatch the three portions of divine lizard skin that were floating in the center of everyone.Xu Qing's savageness was completely revealed at this moment. To him, who had grown up in the slums and experienced the scavenger campsite, he was no stranger to snatching.At that moment, Xu Qing's eyes were filled with ferocity. With a wave of his hand, droplets of water formed in the surroundings and whistled in all directions.As the water droplets shot out like rain, Xu Qing's body ruthlessly collided with a nonhuman cultivator of the Sea Ghost. Immediately after, he slashed the nonhuman's neck with his dagger, causing hot streams of blood to spray out.Xu Qing suddenly retreated and punched the chest of a Litu Sect cultivator behind him, shattering it.The Daoist robe on his body was dyed red with blood, and his handsome face was cold and emotionless.After killing two people in a row, Xu Qing immediately formed a seal with his left hand and the Ba shadow behind him roared, causing the water droplets that shot in all directions to instantly turn into fuel that burned on its own.From afar, it looked like countless fire arrows were shooting in all directions.Under the light of the flames, everyone's shadows looked like they were dancing like demons. No one noticed that there was a shadow moving forward in this chaos, heading straight for the lizard skins.Taking advantage of the spreading flames, Xu Qing abruptly retreated. The instant he retreated, a shadow suddenly leaped up from the ground beside the three lizard skins that were surrounded by everyone.At the same time, the void beside the lizard skins distorted and the figure of the old man from Panquan Road strangely appeared. His eyes were filled with fanaticism as he borrowed the chaos caused by Xu Qing's flames to grab at the three lizard skins.However, he was clearly a step too late as the skins were swept away by the shadow."Damn it!" The old man got nothing and retreated rapidly. The others also sensed this scene and their anger soared. They no longer chased after Xu Qing but rushed toward the old man.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He took advantage of this opportunity to rapidly retreat. He also secretly kept the lizard skins he had snatched with the shadow and headed straight for the foot of the mountain.Just as he was about to leave the basin, the old man who was being chased by everyone suddenly roared."I didn't take it. I only have this storage bag on me. Look carefully." As the old man from Panquan Road spoke, he directly took out his storage bag and threw it toward Xu Qing."Kid, everything is inside. Keep it safe." The old man was also a decisive person. He knew that his words couldn't convince everyone here. At this moment, there was a loud sound as he actually shamelessly shattered all his clothes in front of everyone, leaving only a pair of underwear. After he appeared naked in front of everyone, he even circled around to prove that he had nothing on him.After that, he hugged the huge snake that was watching not far away and quickly fled down the mountain.Although not many people believed him, there were still some who chased after him. Sea Ghost and the Litu Sect were among them. However, the instant they got close to Xu Qing, the cultivators of both sides suddenly changed directions and headed straight for Xu Qing."No matter how secretive you are, it's useless. Others can't sense the aura of the lizard molts but to me, it's like a torch in the night!""Hand over the lizard skins!"Both parties' spells were lethal and fast.Xu Qing retreated, dodging the attacks of the Sea Ghost and the Litu Sect. Killing intent surfaced in his eyes. He didn't bother with the storage bag the old man threw over. He didn't believe that the other party had left anything good there.Moreover, Xu Qing didn't have much hope that this matter could be hidden from the cultivators here. It was just that the old man's attack just now gave him some expectation.However, since he had been discovered, Xu Qing wouldn't be afraid. As the killing intent appeared in his eyes again, he performed a series of hand seals with both hands and quickly pushed forward. Immediately, a blue-colored talisman appeared in front of him.As spirit energy surged in, the talisman was activated and transformed into a huge statue.This statue was like the symbol of the death god of a certain nonhuman race. It had three heads and six arms and its entire body emitted a cold aura of death. It suppressed the Sea Ghost and the cultivators of the Litu Sect.This talisman came from the dead merfolk youth. As it was rarely used, the Foundation Building strike it contained was relatively complete. At this moment, under the suppression, the Litu Sect and the Sea Ghost Organization immediately used their runic treasures to resist it.A huge impact spread out, causing both sides to retreat.Although Xu Qing was strong, there were too many cultivators here and blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth. However, the purple crystal's recovery ability instantly healed him.His gaze became deeper as he coldly stared at the surrounding people.Xu Qing licked his lips. The blood at the corner of his mouth was very fishy and carried a hint of familiarity. It was as though he had returned to the slums and the scavenger campsite.He didn't like complicated things. Now that he had obtained the lizard skins and everyone here didn't want him to leave, things would become simple."Just kill them all."As Xu Qing muttered in his heart, his gaze caused the hearts of the surrounding cultivators to tremble slightly.They had seen ruthless people before, but the killing intent in the eyes of this Seven Blood Eyes' disciple in front of them caused their hearts to skip a beat. However, the temptation from the divine lizard's molt was so great that they had no thoughts to retreat.Only a few rogue cultivators and nonhuman cultivators who had watched Xu Qing attack from the start knew how ruthless he was. Hence, they watched from afar as they waited for an opportunity.Among them were the nonhuman in the straw rain cape and the elephant-nosed burly man.After a short confrontation, the first to make a move was the Litu Sect. One of the members of the Litu Sect had died earlier. At this moment, the remaining seven people attacked at the same time. Spears appeared in their hands as they headed straight for Xu Qing with an overwhelming force.The Sea Ghost cultivators also moved. Some scattered rogue cultivators and nonhuman cultivators also rapidly approached.

His body turned blackish-green and he spat out black blood, falling to the ground as the poison acted up."Poison!"There were quite a few of such cases. In the blink of an eye, seven to eight of the cultivators bled from their seven orifices one after another, causing the hearts of the others to tremble. Xu Qing then made his move.He instantly got close to the Litu Sect. He fiercely swung the dagger in his right hand to block the spear in front of him and moved his body to dodge the spear coming from the side. The dagger in his hand left his hand and directly pierced into the neck of the person beside him.As fresh blood gushed out, Xu Qing's right hand grabbed the leather pouch and the black iron stick instantly appeared. He didn't retreat but advanced instead, directly fighting against everyone who pounced over.The shadow of the Ba appeared once again. It let out a monstrous roar, causing the sea of fire to spread and increasing Xu Qing's physical strength.Instantly, the basin at the top of the mountain was filled with slaughter!At the same time, as the ground rumbled, the old man in the distance finally shook off the pursuers behind him. He carried the huge snake and turned his head to take a look, immediately cursing angrily."Brat, so it was you who took them!"Amidst the cursing, his speed became even faster. As for the giant snake, it was very unwilling and struggled as though it wanted to help. It let out an anxious gurgle.The old man glared."That brat is too treacherous, you silly girl."As he spoke, he knocked out the snake with a palm strike and fled rapidly with it. Very soon, he arrived at the shore and directly jumped into the sea to escape.

Chapter 153 Blood Dyeing The Sea Lizard Island (1)
The weather was different in the sea at night; it was as profound and unpredictable as the sea.In the surroundings of Sea Lizard Island, thunder rumbled in the sky and bolts of lightning flashed.A storm was about to descend.Under the illumination of the lightning, at the top of the highest mountain on Sea Lizard Island, the mad slaughter continued.The value of the three lizard skins with divinity was enough to make rogue cultivators risk their lives.The loud sounds of the battle and thunder overlapped. The killing intent in Xu Qing's eyes was so dense that it was about to overflow. His body ruthlessly collided with the body of a Litu Sect cultivator, and the huge impact pushed the other party's body back.Xu Qing ignored this person's counterattack and the incoming spells as he stabbed the other party's chest and heart six times in a row with the black iron stick.Every strike caused the Litu Sect cultivator's body to tremble. At the next instant, as the spells from the surroundings arrived, Xu Qing's body swayed and he dodged. Amidst the rumbling sounds, the corpse of the dead Litu Sect cultivator broke into pieces.The instant Xu Qing retreated, four nonhuman body refinement Sea Ghost cultivators surrounded him and attacked recklessly.There was also the burly Sea Ghost cultivator with the sinister face on his chest. He performed a series of hand seals and a gigantic blood ball formed which transformed into a blood-colored bat that flew toward Xu Qing. It had sharp teeth, as though once bitten by it, even if the target didn't die, they would be heavily injured.Seeing that he was in danger, Xu Qing waved his talisman to form a protective barrier. After resisting the attacks of the blood-colored bat and the few Sea Ghost cultivators, he borrowed the momentum to retreat and headed straight for the three Litu Sect cultivators who were rushing over.His goal was very clear. He had to kill the Litu Sect first!The reason why he chose the Litu Sect was because the other party posed the greatest threat to him.The Litu Sect's indifference to life wasn't only targeted at outsiders but also at themselves. This allowed their combat strength to be extremely high.Xu Qing's retreat was accompanied by the Ba shadow's sea of flames. However, the expressions of the three Litu Sect cultivators didn't change at all. They continued to rush over and instantly collided with Xu Qing, attempting to exchange death for injury.When they collided, one of the three Litu Sect cultivators' chest caved in but he still held onto Xu Qing's waist. The other's forehead was penetrated by the iron stick but he firmly grabbed onto it, not giving Xu Qing a chance to retract it.The eyes of the last person revealed emotions for the first time - fanaticism."Litu!" He shouted and his body instantly burned, transforming into a dazzling spear of light that headed straight for Xu Qing at an astonishing speed.It arrived in an instant and was about to pierce through.A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. The 900-foot-high spirit sea in his body erupted and transformed outside his body, sweeping in all directions.The two corpses of the Litu Sect's dead cultivators were instantly crushed. Even the cultivators who were rushing in couldn't dodge and were sent flying in all directions. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Xu Qing moved to the side. The approaching light spear that carried heat and destructive intent slashed past his chest. Although he wasn't pierced, just that graze caused his flesh to be badly mangled.Xu Qing's breathing was hurried as he continued to retreat fifty feet away. After that, he stopped and crouched down like a cat. His right foot stomped fiercely on the ground and he charged out like an arrow leaving the bow.He left afterimages as he arrived in front of another Litu Sect cultivator. This Litu Sect cultivator's eyes also emitted fanaticism."Litu!" He let out a low roar and actually chose to self-destruct.Now, there were only three people left in the Litu Sect.Among these three people, other than the one in the middle who didn't move, the other two quickly rushed out and headed straight for Xu Qing.Their eyes under their robes were also burning with passion. They also chose to self-destruct.The Sea Ghost became anxious. The remaining 11 or 12 people immediately attacked. As they unleashed their trump cards, three talismans formed killing intent that suppressed Xu Qing.Not only that, but the eyes of the rogue cultivators in the surroundings who were originally watching and those who rushed over from the other mountain peaks also revealed fervor. They moved closer one after another and some even started attacking.Xu Qing seemed to have fallen into an intense crisis. At the next instant, as the three Litu Sect cultivators self-destructed, the Sea Ghost attacked, and the talismans activated, the place where Xu Qing was at was instantly drowned by rumbling sounds and dust. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, before the dust could settle, Xu Qing rushed out like lightning.The yellow light barrier around his body flickered. It was formed from the power of another talisman.He also had a flight talisman on his leg.All of this caused Xu Qing's speed to surpass its previous limit. He instantly arrived in front of a rogue cultivator holding a dagger and slammed into him.Amidst the mournful cries, the rogue cultivator's body collapsed. Xu Qing didn't stop. He caught the dagger the other party released and sped through the surrounding crowd.There was still blood at the corner of his mouth and his Daoist robe was torn in many places. However, the coldness in his eyes didn't melt at all.Everywhere he passed, miserable cries rang out and corpses fell to the ground. Blood flowed in all directions, causing the soil on the mountaintop to emit an intense stench of blood.There were also a few Sea Ghost cultivators whose heads flew up as Xu Qing passed by them.This savage slaughter lasted until the last person from the Litu Sect and the burly man with a face on his chest from the Sea Ghost Organization acted together to stop Xu Qing. Only then did Xu Qing's killing spree halt.

Chapter 154 Blood Dyeing The Sea Lizard Island (2)
Xu Qing forcefully endured the bombardment of the two people's spells and pierced his hand into the chest of a rogue cultivator. He then retreated and landed on a large rock. He squatted slightly and lifted his head, panting a little as he coldly looked at the remaining cultivators in the surroundings.There was one person left from the Litu Sect, the leader.There were still four people from the Sea Ghost Organization, including the burly man.As Xu Qing's gaze swept over, blood dripped down the edge of his dagger, merging with the blood on the ground.With the flight talisman on him, Xu Qing could actually attempt to fly out of here. However, everyone here wanted to kill him.Xu Qing's principles made him stay. He had to do his best to kill all the threats here.By now, there were over 40 corpses in the surroundings. Dense aura of death filled the area. The rogue cultivators shivered and didn't dare to continue as they retreated one after another.Xu Qing frowned slightly.He didn't want to let go of anyone who had attacked him. Even though their cultivation was low, Xu Qing still felt that they could be a hidden danger.Just as he was about to chase them, the remaining member of the Litu Sect suddenly spoke."I only want a lizard skin. Give it to me. After I report this matter, you can obtain the friendship of my Litu Sect!""I only want one too. Otherwise, with your current state, it's hard to say if you'll survive." A sharp voice rang out from the face on the burly Sea Ghost cultivator's chest, and the red light in his eyes grew even more intense.Xu Qing ignored them. The flight talisman activated once again as he headed straight for the rogue cultivators who had attacked him in the distance. His speed was so fast that he instantly got close to them. Heads instantly started flying.Just as he was about to continue killing, the Litu Sect and the Sea Ghost directly chose to join forces and rushed over together.Among them, the black robe of the team leader of the Litu Sect spread out, revealing the face of a middle-aged man. His eyes were cold and his body emitted a shocking aura.This aura surpassed the Perfected Qi Condensation and wasn't far from Foundation Building.With a wave of his hand, a thick black fog appeared behind him. The fog churned and formed a huge tombstone.This tombstone was filled with cracks and countless souls were struggling in the cracks. However, upon closer inspection, it was still very blurry. Clearly, with this person's strength, he couldn't display it more clearly and could only borrow illusions.The foggy tombstone headed straight for Xu Qing.As for the burly Sea Ghost cultivator, he let out a sharp roar; his body withered, but the face on his chest was filled with more color and the red light in its eyes spread out. Its entire face turned red until it spat out a mouthful of blood.As soon as the blood appeared, it transformed into a blood-colored flying sword with a baleful aura that sped toward Xu Qing.The remaining Sea Ghost cultivators were the same. They all used their trump cards.At this critical moment, Xu Qing suddenly lifted his right hand and pointed at the sky. Immediately, purple light flickered from his body and rapidly gathered above his head, forming a huge long saber. This saber was 100 feet long and 30 feet wide. Its entire body shone with purple light and the coldness of the blade was oppressive!It was like a heavenly saber that stood in mid-air and emitted an indescribable rhythm of Dao. It seemed to contain the laws of the world and emitted an earth-shattering aura.As soon as this saber appeared, the expression of the burly Sea Ghost cultivator changed and he cried out involuntarily."He comprehended a Dao Art in Qi Condensation?? F*cking hell... Is this something that can be comprehended by a Qi Condensation cultivator!!!" As he spoke, he retreated, trying to escape.The leader of the Litu Sect's team also trembled violently and his face turned pale.Xu Qing's face was expressionless as his palm moved down.A rumbling sound shook the heavens and the earth. The purple saber in the sky slashed down and landed in the basin. Everything in its path was slashed!The blood-colored flying sword shattered into pieces.The black tombstone collapsed and exploded.The ground rumbled, leaving behind a huge saber mark that cut the basin in half. The leader of the Litu Sect's team was also cut in half. He stared at Xu Qing in a daze. At the next moment, his body was torn apart and fresh blood spurted out.The body of the burly Sea Ghost cultivator in the distance trembled violently and despair appeared in his eyes. He wanted to lower his head and look at his waist, but before he could do so, his body directly split into two from the waist. The face on his chest was also covered with an aura of death.At the same time, the remaining few Sea Ghost cultivators' bodies broke apart.The entire battlefield fell silent. Only the sky rumbled and the rain... finally fell.The gushing rain splattered on the ground, but it was difficult for it to wash away the blood stains here.Xu Qing stood in the rain and panted. There were many injuries on his body. Although most of them were already healing, there were still some serious injuries that couldn't be healed immediately.This battle wasn't simple for him either. There were too many enemies.He turned his head and looked at the trembling nonhuman in the straw rain cape and the elephant-nosed burly man not far away."We didn't attack!""We didn't get involved from the start!!" The two of them trembled uncontrollably when Xu Qing's gaze swept past them.Xu Qing didn't speak. He shifted his gaze and looked at the fleeing rogue cultivators in the distance. They had attacked Xu Qing before and dispersed when they saw that the situation wasn't good.Xu Qing didn't chase after them. As he stared coldly, those rogue cultivators and nonhumans screamed miserably before they could leave the island. Their bodies turned greenish-black and they died from poison.This scene caused the bodies of the nonhuman in the straw rain cape and the elephant-nosed burly man to tremble even more.Ignoring the two of them, Xu Qing turned and grabbed into the distance with his right hand. Immediately, the black iron stick flew over. After it landed in his hand, he waved it again. This black iron stick was incomparably agile and shuttled rapidly through the corpses in the surroundings. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  To prevent some people from pretending to be dead, Xu Qing dealt the final blows.As for the nonhuman in the straw rain cape and the elephant-nosed burly man, they tried to retreat. Only when they retreated far away and discovered that Xu Qing didn't pay attention to them and seemed to have let them go did the two of them relax. However, they still used all their strength and frantically fled for a distance. Only when they descended the mountain and entered the jungle did they truly heave a sigh of relief.However, the greed hidden in their hearts wasn't extinguished. They each secretly took out jade slips, wanting to transmit their voices to the great cultivator leader outside. They were afraid that if they were too late, Xu Qing would escape.However, before they could transmit their voices, two cold lights whistled over from behind them and passed through their necks.They instantly died.Xu Qing calmly retracted his gaze. He knew that although there were no Foundation Building cultivators on Sea Lizard Island, it didn't mean that there weren't any in the sea. As for the two people who had escaped, it was extremely suspicious for them to try to send a voice transmission at this moment. There was a high chance that they were trying to send a message to someone.Normal people wouldn't think of sending messages at this moment.Xu Qing dealt the finishing blow while organizing his gains on the battlefield.Not long later, he looked at the corpses on the ground. Suddenly, the shadow under his feet spread out and grabbed the necks of the three rogue cultivators who were pretending to be dead and lifted them up.Before the three of them could beg for mercy, their necks shattered and they instantly died.At the same time that Xu Qing attacked, the dead face on the chest of the burly Sea Ghost cultivator who had been split into two opened its eyes abruptly and rushed out, transforming into a blood-colored imp.It was unknown what method it used but it didn't hesitate to expend its energy to fly into the air. Its speed was so fast that it instantly left the island and was already on the sea, fleeing crazily into the distance.Xu Qing coldly looked over and spoke for the first time since the battle started."Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale!"As soon as he finished speaking, the sea beside the Sea Lizard Island suddenly erupted. Waves surged into the sky and a thousand-foot-long plesiosaur broke out of the sea and devoured the blood-colored imp!Its figure covered the moonlight, and its huge body left behind the stench of the sea. After devouring the red figure, it slammed back into the sea.The sea rumbled and waves surged.The rain became heavier.

Chapter 155 Like A Phoenix Or An Eagle (1)
A long time later, Xu Qing's figure appeared on the beach under the rain.He walked past the skeletons buried in the sand and washed out by the rain, and looked at the sea from the shore.The waves rose and fell in the sea, as though it hid endless danger.Xu Qing recalled the Litu Sect's boat. It was already gone.He knew that no Foundation Building cultivators dared to set foot on this island, nor did they dare to stay nearby. However, Xu Qing felt that if there was really a Foundation Building cultivator with malicious intent, the greatest possibility was that they would be waiting in the outer perimeter.They were waiting for the Qi Condensation cultivators, who had returned from the Sea Lizard Island with heavy harvests, and kill them for the sea lizard skins, or were waiting for the people they had sent.Xu Qing wasn't sure if the people from the Sea Ghost Organization and the Litu Sect had Foundation Building cultivators following them. However, if they did, there was a high chance that they had already obtained the information. After all, it was impossible for him to block all the information during the chaotic battle just now.After some thought, Xu Qing decided not to leave immediately. He sat down and silently meditated here, recuperating his cultivation and recovering his energy.When he had mostly recovered, he opened his eyes in the rain and looked at the distant sea. The coldness in his eyes intensified."If there's really a Foundation Building cultivator..." Xu Qing weighed the pros and cons and suppressed his killing intent.He wasn't sure how many Foundation Building cultivators there were, so he didn't want to continue fighting unless it was absolutely necessary.He walked to the seaside and took out the magic boat. With a wave of his right hand, cracking sounds rang out from the magic boat. Its appearance was still the same but a very small boat had fallen out from below.This swift boat was set up by Zhang San in case there was danger and the magic boat collapsed.It wasn't the sect's standard magic boat, and its structure was also different. It was extremely poor in defense and attack. However, under Zhang San's refinement, its speed was emphasized. The speed it could erupt with was more than twice the speed of the magic boat within a certain period of time.However, it was very dangerous to sail it for a long time.Xu Qing stared at it for a moment and determination appeared in his eyes. He took down the control jade slip of the magic boat and adjusted it so that the magic boat could sail on its own. After that, he set the route for it and fully activated its defense before sending it off.Looking at the departing magic boat, Xu Qing suppressed his heartache and turned to step into the swift boat at the side.The moment he stood on the swift boat and was ready to leave Sea Lizard Island, Xu Qing looked back at this island.The island in the rain was a scene of darkness. The vegetation inside rustled in the wind and rain, as though they were whispering and discussing this blood-stained battle.The wind blew and the rain fell, the mountains were moving but the people were quiet.Xu Qing looked at all of this. After a long time, he bowed deeply toward the island."Sorry for disturbing you, Senior."With that, he controlled the swift boat to sink into the sea without any hesitation.The instant the swift boat entered the sea, Xu Qing retracted all his aura. Moreover, the dragonwhale arrived and enveloped the boat.In the night rain, Xu Qing rode the boat and sped forward. This was the method Xu Qing thought of. One of the two boats was in the open and the other was in the dark. They moved in different directions to avoid the possibility of Foundation Building cultivators locking onto them.As he left, this island that was silent in the rain suddenly trembled and slowly sank... The seawater rolled over, instantly washing away the bloodstains that couldn't be cleared by the rain.A moment later, when the island surfaced again, there was no longer any blood on it. As for the collapsed trees and shattered mountain rocks, they strangely returned to normal.Only in the depths of the sea under the island, a pair of gigantic eyes slowly opened. They looked indifferently at the swift boat that was far away. After a long time... they closed again. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  An hour later.In the swift boat that was moving with astonishing speed, Xu Qing suddenly opened his eyes. He took out the jade slip that controlled the magic boat and slowly narrowed his eyes.The jade slip shattered.This meant that the magic boat that was sailing by itself had been destroyed."As expected, there's a Foundation Building cultivator.""Then should I dive deeper and hide, wait for the Foundation Building cultivators to leave after failing to find me, or should I speed up my escape?" Xu Qing fell silent and chose the latter.He didn't want to stay here and wait for death. After all, the danger under the sea was equally terrifying. If the other party did not leave this area for a long time, he would be in an extremely passive state.He didn't want to place his life on other people's decisions.While controlling the swift boat to speed up, he also restrained his aura to a greater extent.Fortunately, the seawater helped in concealing his aura as well. In addition, Xu Qing wasn't afraid of anomalous substances. This allowed him to dive deeper, causing the concealment of his aura to be even greater.The only thing he had to consider was whether the swift boat could withstand the pressure.However, Xu Qing knew that now wasn't the time to think about this problem. Under his control, the swift boat sped forward at the bottom of the sea. Not long later, Xu Qing's eyes narrowed.He sensed danger coming from the direction of the sea, as though it was probing and searching.Xu Qing silently controlled the boat to sink deeper and continued forward.However, that sense of danger still existed. The swift boat was also showing signs of being unable to withstand the pressure and invasion of anomalous substances under the sea. Seeing that it would be damaged if this continued, Xu Qing simply put away the swift boat and immersed himself in the body of the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale before moving forward again.Just like that, time flowed by and a night passed.The sense of danger from the sea gradually decreased but there were still a few strands that remained. It was as though they had used some unknown method to lock onto Xu Qing.This made Xu Qing not dare to be careless at all. He gritted his teeth and was about to rush deeper into the sea, wanting to avoid being locked onto.

Chapter 156 Like A Phoenix Or An Eagle (2)
Right at this moment, Xu Qing's mind suddenly trembled. An indescribable pressure descended from the sky, enveloping the sea in all directions.Xu Qing couldn't see the situation on the surface of the sea but he could sense how terrifying this pressure was.This wasn't something that could be formed by a Foundation Building cultivator. It was more like a certain colossus spreading its aura. At the same time that this pressure appeared, the auras that seemed to have locked onto him instantly became chaotic, as though they were fleeing in panic.While he was shocked, Xu Qing still knew to use this chance to speed up. After he moved far away and couldn't sense the lock on his aura, he hesitated for a moment before continuing to move forward.However, he was clear that he couldn't do this for long. The danger under the sea had not appeared, but it would definitely be more dangerous if he continued to move under the sea.Hence, after confirming repeatedly that he sensed no danger on the surface, Xu Qing carefully ascended. The moment half of his head appeared on the surface of the sea, he quickly looked around. However, at the next instant, he was attracted by the scene in the sky.It should have been morning but the sky had turned pitch-black. The reason why the sky was pitch-black was because of a majestic black cloud.The range of this black cloud was too large, covering hundreds of kilometers and blotting out the sky.The sea area Xu Qing was in was currently enveloped in its shadow.The sound of wind and lightning, as well as rumbling sounds came out from the black clouds. There were even bolts of astonishing lightning swimming within like there was a calamity brewing in the sky.Wherever it passed, the sea would stir up a storm, as though it was kowtowing to this existence in the sky!If that was all, it would be fine. What shocked Xu Qing was that within this moving black cloud, there was an unimaginable existence. A portion of its body that was revealed seemed to possess the power to suppress lifeforms, causing Xu Qing's flesh and blood to stiffen. His soul was rumbling and his mind was blank.Only his eyes could move, allowing him to see the blurry appearance of the terrifying existence in the black cloud clearly.It was a gigantic creature that looked like a phoenix or an eagle with its entire body burning with black flames!Phoenix head, snake neck, swallow chin, turtle back, fish tail!Within the black flames, its entire body was shining with five colors and was so dazzling that the black flames couldn't hide it at all. It was soaring in the black clouds in the sky and was filled with divinity.  novel online free at ’º0 ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  In fact, it even had some faint resemblance to the aura of the god's fragmented face.Clearly, it was its appearance that caused those unknown cultivators who had ill intentions toward Xu Qing to have no choice but to give up on pursuing him and retreat.The world rumbled. As the black clouds sped away, they slowly left the sky, revealing the bright sky behind the clouds. Xu Qing also gradually recovered his mobility and he instinctively inhaled.However, the instant he inhaled, the extremely terrifying existence in the black clouds in the distant sky suddenly turned its head and glanced at the distant sea. With just this glance, a large area of the sea dozens of kilometers away from Xu Qing instantly rose. Waves surged into the sky like a tsunami. The anomalous substances became denser, as though they were being pulled into a spot.Even though Xu Qing was very far away and couldn't see clearly, his body still swayed with the waves and his mind rumbled.That phoenix-eagle retracted its gaze and entered the black clouds again. Amidst the rumbling thunder, it disappeared into the distant horizon.After a long time, when the waves of the sea calmed down, Xu Qing let out a long breath. His face was pale as he looked at the distant horizon, his mind in chaos.The feeling this divine bird gave him was unprecedented. Even the giant pulling the bronze dragon carriage at the bottom of the sea seemed to be weaker in Xu Qing's perception."What is it? It is flying toward the Nanhuang Continent‚Ä¶" As Xu Qing mumbled, he suddenly realized something."Nanhuang Continent's <anno data-annotation-id="3f93a413-0501-4798-8571-31fd6cec91f2">'phoenix</anno>'‚Ä¶"Xu Qing had read many books and dossiers in the Homicide Department. He thought of the name of the forbidden zone on the other side of the Truth Mountain Range that occupied 70% of the Nanhuang Continent."The largest forbidden zone in the Nanhuang Continent, the Phoenix Forbidden Zone‚Ä¶"Xu Qing's heart shook as he made a guess. A moment later, he took a deep breath and suppressed this guess. He was going to inquire and search for information to confirm it when he returned.With this thought in mind, Xu Qing sank back into the sea. After speeding for several hours, he sensed that no one was pursuing him. Only then did he return to the surface of the sea. He took out the swift boat and leaped onto it, controlling it to speed up his escape.Very soon, three days passed. Xu Qing was extremely careful on the way. He probed many times and finally confirmed that those pursuing auras had really disappeared. Only then did he heave a long sigh of relief.He guessed that the phoenix's appearance had imperceptibly given him some help, causing those malicious cultivators to be unable to clearly investigate his location and lose track of him.However, Xu Qing didn't dare to let his guard down. Although he no longer moved under the sea, he still controlled the boat to move at its full speed. He didn't hesitate to spend spirit stones.During these three days, more than half of his injuries had healed. His face was no longer pale and the fatigue from the slaughter had dissipated.Recalling the massacre earlier, even though his cultivation and combat strength were extraordinary, he still felt a fatigue he hadn't felt in a long time. Fortunately, the benefits this time could be said to be astonishing which caused him to reveal a satisfied expression.Other than the three divine molts, he also obtained more than ten eighth or ninth level Qi Condensation lizard molts. As for low-level lizard molts, he had even more of them.Other than that, there were also a number of treasures.He even obtained three talismans. Although the runes on them were already blurry and he couldn't use them many times, they were still valuable.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="3f93a413-0501-4798-8571-31fd6cec91f2">Huang (Âá∞) in Nanhuang is the character for female phoenix</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 157 Like A Phoenix Or An Eagle (3)
As for spirit stones‚Ä¶ Xu Qing calculated that there were about 4,000.Most rogue cultivators were poor. The reason why Xu Qing had gained so much was because he had killed everyone on the island and looted them. Among them, the main contributor of the spirit stones was the Sea Ghost Organization.As for the Litu Sect, Xu Qing had checked their pockets, but they were really poor for some reason.He was regretful about that but when he thought of his gains this time, he didn't care about the low gains from the Litu Sect."Even if I don't include the divine sea lizard molts, I still have a harvest of almost 20,000 spirit stones." Xu Qing sat and counted the spoils of war while navigating the swift boat to move in the direction of the Seven Blood Eyes.The increase in his cultivation and the benefits he obtained from this trip allowed Xu Qing to not care about the consumption of spirit stones by the swift boat.From this trip, Xu Qing's reverence for the sea deepened.Now that his pockets were full, he only had one thought, and that was to return as soon as possible.With the enhancement of a large number of spirit stones, the swift boat continued to operate at its limit. His returning speed was more than twice as fast. According to his judgment, he would be able to return to the sect in three days at most.For the rest of the journey, Xu Qing didn't encounter much danger because he was close to the coast of the Nanhuang Continent. When he was only half a day away from the Seven Blood Eyes' port, he saw a boat from the sect.It was a battleship speeding toward him.Although this battleship looked like it belonged to the Seventh Peak's Coast Guard Department, Xu Qing was still on guard. His plesiosaur at the bottom of the sea swam around and was prepared to fight at any time. At the same time, he noticed that there were five dragonwhales under the battleship.Moreover, one of them looked a little different. It looked like a dragonwhale but it was actually somewhat similar to the megalodon.Xu Qing's heart shook and he became even more vigilant.Not long later, the battleship gradually got closer and was clearly reflected in Xu Qing's eyes.The huge ship was engraved with array formations that emitted terrifying fluctuations. There were also more than 80 magic spikes that seemed to be able to stimulate astonishing power around the ship. As for the deck, one could see more than 30 Seventh Peak disciples. All of this meant that this battleship possessed formidable combat strength."Seven Blood Eyes' Seventh Peak's Coast Guard Department on duty. Boat in front, state your identity." A dignified voice rang out from the Coast Guard Department's battleship as it got closer."Xu Qing from the Seventh Peak's Homicide Department." Xu Qing looked at the Coast Guard Department's battleship and calmly spoke.There were over 30 cultivators on the battleship and it was clear they were surrounding a single person. The person they were surrounding was a youth in a gray Daoist robe. His gaze was like lightning and carried intense pressure. The fluctuations of the Perfected Qi Condensation from his body were quite extraordinary.He looked at Xu Qing in the swift boat and a hint of sharpness flashed in his eyes. "Xu Qing?" After Xu Qing reported his name, a familiar voice rang out from behind the thirty-odd people on the Coast Guard Department's battleship. Very soon, a person walked out from behind the crowd. It was none other than Zhou Qingpeng.His expression was filled with surprise. After greeting Xu Qing, he turned and respectfully whispered a few words to the youth.The youth nodded expressionlessly.  novel online free at ’º0 ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  Zhou Qingpeng cupped his fists and leaped up from the battleship with joy. He landed on Xu Qing's swift boat and smiled."Xu Qing, I didn't expect us to meet at sea. Did you return from the sea?""I've been out for some time. I'm returning to the sect." Xu Qing looked at the youth on the battleship."That's my boss, Ding Xiaohai from the Coast Guard Department," Zhou Qingpeng said proudly. After that, he glanced at Xu Qing's swift boat."What happened to you? Why has your boat become so shabby‚Ä¶ The Coast Guard Department has the right to inspect all the boats, but looking at your boat, we can forget about it." Zhou Qingpeng smiled and exchanged a few more pleasantries with Xu Qing. Under Xu Qing's congratulations, he cupped his fists and prepared to return.Before he left, he seemed to have thought of something and spoke to Xu Qing in a low voice."By the way, Xu Qing, don't go out to sea again for some time after you return. Our Coast Guard Department has received a notice that the seabed has been a little chaotic recently. I heard from my boss that some terrifying existences have appeared for some reason."Zhou Qingpeng's expression was filled with palpitations. He didn't say anything else and turned to return to the battleship."Terrifying existences?" Xu Qing's eyes narrowed and his expression was solemn. He cupped his fists and thanked Zhou Qingpeng.Very soon, the Coast Guard Department's battleship made honking sounds and changed directions, gradually leaving into the distance.While Xu Qing was looking at the battleship, Ding Xiaohai tilted his head and looked at Xu Qing's swift boat in the distance. He then looked at the faintly discernible plesiosaur in the sea below the swift boat and calmly spoke to Zhou Qingpeng, who was reporting to him."Zhou Qingpeng, your peer isn't simple."Zhou Qingpeng was stunned and whispered."Senior Brother Ding, when the Night Dove operation was carried out, it was rumored that someone killed the enemy leader as an ordinary member‚Ä¶""He is that person." There was a deeper meaning in Ding Xiaohai's gaze.When Zhou Qingpeng heard this, he couldn't help but be in a daze. He turned his head and looked at Xu Qing's boat in the distance.One could faintly see the figure of the youth on the magic boat standing there. The wind and waves rose and fell but they could not shake him at all.

Chapter 158 Gu Muqing
The day passed in the blink of an eye.As the bright moon reappeared in the sky, the quiet sea gradually fell asleep. Starlight scattered the ground, covering the Seven Blood Eyes' bay with a mysterious veil.From afar, the seven mountain peaks and the seven blood-colored giant eyes at the top of the mountains looked like they were protecting as well as intimidating.What they protected was the prosperity of the Seven Blood Eyes, causing the commoners to yearn for it and be willing to come here. They would create their value here and provide a vast amount of residency fees, allowing the Seven Blood Eyes' industries to continue earning profits.What they intimidated was the outside world, the nonhuman races, and those with ill intentions, telling them not to cross the line.As for the cruelty between their disciples, it was the same concept as nurturing Gu. They wanted to nurture wolves that could survive in chaotic times.Only such a wolf was worthy of truly joining the Seven Blood Eyes and enjoying the right to its benefits.By now, Xu Qing had a complete understanding of the rules of the Seven Blood Eyes. He looked at the harbor in front of him and lowered the speed of the swift boat, slowly entering the harbor.The magic boats of the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples were floating on the sea. Beams of strong light from the lighthouse swept in all directions, causing the sparkling sea water under the moonlight to appear dazzling for an instant when the light passed by.This lasted until one of the lighthouse beams landed outside Port 79's harbor gate. It stopped for a moment on a swift boat that looked like it was about to fall apart.The light quickly gathered in front of Xu Qing, who was standing on the boat.The strong light was piercing. Xu Qing covered his eyes with his hand and took out his token.A gentle light emitted from the token, as though an invisible array had swept past it, confirming Xu Qing's identity. Very soon, a small gate slowly opened at the entrance of Port 79.The beam of light that was focused on Xu Qing also moved away, causing the world in front of Xu Qing to turn pitch-black for a moment. However, it quickly returned to normal.As his swift boat entered the harbor through the small gate, a familiar wind blew over from the shore, blowing Xu Qing's hair. He looked at the harbor in front of him and heaved a sigh of relief.No matter how harsh and savage the environment in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city was, it was still better compared to the sea.After all, here, the enemies he met among the piedmont disciples wouldn't surpass his cultivation by a major realm."I'm back." Xu Qing mumbled and controlled the swift boat to head straight for his berth.His late-night return attracted the attention of some disciples from Port 79.If it was anyone else, they might have let it go after taking a glance. However, after noticing that it was Xu Qing, many disciples walked out of their magic boats and cupped their fists in goodwill.Xu Qing's previous breakthrough and the appearance of the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale had made him very famous in Port 79.When these disciples who walked out of the magic boats swept their gazes across Xu Qing, they also noticed his broken swift boat. They knew that the other party had encountered great danger at sea.However, most of the piedmont disciples knew their limits and understood that they shouldn't ask what should not be asked. Hence, they pretended not to see the damage to Xu Qing's swift boat.Facing the greetings of his fellow disciples, Xu Qing cupped his fists and returned the greeting. After his swift boat arrived at its berth, Xu Qing looked around and entered the cabin before starting his meditation.It was just like before he went out to sea.As he closed his eyes, Xu Qing's heart completely calmed down from the massacre earlier. However, his vigilance had already been engraved into his soul, especially now that he had returned with a heavy harvest. Although there was a high chance that with his current reputation, no one would dare to rob him, he still had to be vigilant.Xu Qing scattered even more poison powder around the berth, regardless of whether it was in the sea or on the shore.At the same time, Xu Qing didn't forget that he had killed the merfolk youth before he left. Moreover, the other party had Dao Protectors."I wonder how the matter with that dead fish is now." Xu Qing fell silent. He didn't inquire about it and continued to cultivate warily.The night passed.The next morning, the wind was gentle and the sun was bright.The morning light seemed to have transformed into a graceful woman who walked over gently, scattering gentleness everywhere, calling all living beings to wake up and dispelling the coldness of the night from the world.As the light landed on the cabin, Xu Qing opened his eyes and walked out, staring at the port area.What greeted Xu Qing's eyes was the familiar world, the familiar light, the familiar figures, and everything familiar.Regardless of whether it was the patrolling disciples, the fellow disciples who woke up early, the commoners who were bustling about, or the fragrance of food, all of them made Xu Qing feel very good.He didn't care about the tattered Daoist robe on his body. He leaped off the swift boat and put it away. He first went to the breakfast shop he used to go to every day. Under the enthusiastic greeting of the shopkeeper, he ate a full meal.The shopkeeper didn't pay much attention to his somewhat tattered Daoist robe after sweeping his gaze across it. He had seen such scenes many times.The familiar taste caused Xu Qing to eat double the amount he would normally eat. After he paid the bill, he didn't head to the Homicide Department to cancel his leave immediately. Instead, he went to the main city's disciple administration office, where he bought a new set of Daoist robes.After changing, Xu Qing thought about it and walked all the way to the location of Zhang San's Transportation Department. He felt that the swift boat could still be used after repairing it. As for the magic boat... he would have to refine it again. However, when he thought of his harvest, Xu Qing felt that it was not a problem to refine it again."Also, I took advantage of Senior Brother Zhang last time. I have to make up for it this time." Xu Qing touched his pouch and quickly walked forward.Not long later, when the sun was high in the sky, Xu Qing saw the Transportation Department from afar. He also saw that other than the members of the Transportation Department, there were also some unfamiliar disciples.There were seven to eight of these disciples and they were all women. All of them had graceful figures that even their Daoist robes couldn't conceal. They were curvy and graceful.Their appearances were equally beautiful and they had a unique alchemy temperament that belonged to the Second Peak.They were all disciples of the Second Peak. At that moment, they were clustered around a core disciple. She wore a light orange Daoist robe and was especially eye-catching among the many disciples. Her appearance was the same. She looked exquisite and her appearance was radiating. She was a peerless beauty.She looked to be about 16 or 17 years old. Her features were clear and filled with charm.Her nature seemed to be very gentle. Although she was surrounded, she didn't emit the superiority of a core disciple. She stood there quietly and looked very elegant.Xu Qing's gaze swept over and he slowly walked closer. He then saw Zhang San surrounded by these Second Peak disciples.Compared to those extraordinary-looking Second Peak disciples, Zhang San, who was squatting on the sandbag and rubbing his hands, looked ordinary. His farmer-like appearance looked simple and ordinary.Zhang San saw Xu Qing's arrival immediately. He greeted Xu Qing and patted his chest at the Second Peak disciples beside him."Don't worry, there's no problem this time. When I, Old Zhang, go out to sea, the various races will give me some face."Noticing that Zhang San seemed to be discussing business, Xu Qing didn't disturb him. Instead, he walked to a dark corner and waited silently.Xu Qing, who was wearing a gray Daoist robe, had a handsome appearance and a gentle expression. However, the darkness he was in formed a sharp contrast with the sunlight outside.Under the sunlight, they would see that the gentleness on Xu Qing's face was just a mask. Under that mask was an indifferent expression that had fused with the shadow. There was a hint of coldness that kept people away for thousands of miles.Added with his long hair and tall figure, it formed a unique aura.This attracted the attention of the Second Peak's disciples and most of them glanced at him.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He didn't care about these gazes and waited silently.Not long later, Zhang San finished talking to the Second Peak's disciples and arrived in front of Xu Qing."Kid, you're finally back. How was your harvest on this trip?""Not bad." Looking at Zhang San, Xu Qing smiled."It's good as long as you gained something. Do you see those Second Peak disciples?" Zhang San had a smug expression on his face as he raised his chin at the group of Second Peak disciples who were about to leave."Do you see the prettiest chick among them? That's the core disciple of the Second Peak, Gu Muqing. I wonder how many people have dreamt of her as their Dao companion. Cough, it is my dream as well.""They want to go out to sea to train. This is a big job. I competed with many of my fellow disciples at our port to obtain the qualifications to lead them out to sea. Even your captain could not win against me."Zhang San looked at Xu Qing expectantly, as though he wanted to see his envy.Xu Qing nodded.Zhang San was a little depressed."I say... Junior Brother Xu Qing, shouldn't you congratulate me? Maybe after this, I'll have a Dao companion."Xu Qing thought about it and felt that what the other party said made sense. Hence, he squeezed out an envious expression and spoke seriously."Congratulations."Zhang San was speechless and gave up on the thought of seeing envy from Xu Qing."Alright, it's hard for you to do that... You came here to inspect and repair the magic boat, right?"Xu Qing retracted his expression and took out a piece of sea lizard skin of acceptable quality from his pouch."Senior Brother Zhang, I did come to repair the boat and I hope to use this sea lizard skin to make the refined magic boat stronger." Just as Xu Qing said this, he suddenly paused and lifted his head to look at the Second Peak's disciples not far away.These Second Peak disciples were originally about to leave but at this moment, the Second Peak's heaven chosen, Gu Muqing, whom Zhang San mentioned, noticed the sea lizard skin Xu Qing took out. Her footsteps paused and her eyes lit up."Fellow disciple, is the sea lizard skin in your hand of an eighth level Qi Condensation sea lizard?"Gu Muqing's voice had the unique immaturity of a young girl. It was delicate and graceful as it scattered under the sunlight, merging with the pill fragrance on her body. It was like a soft singing voice that made one feel good. n(ovelbin[.]nEt However, when it entered Xu Qing's ears, he frowned slightly and instinctively kept the sea lizard skin. He then looked at Gu Muqing warily.At the same time, his heart was filled with vigilance. He also reminded himself that he couldn't carelessly take out the sea lizard skins just because he had gained a lot of them and they could be sold in the sect's shops.He should have waited for the other party to leave before taking it out.Gu Muqing also sensed the change in Xu Qing's expression and hurriedly walked over to explain."I want to refine a pill and require a large number of sea lizard skins. The better the quality, the better. I've bought all the sea lizard skins in the city. This is also the reason why I am making a trip to the sea this time, but I don't know if my harvest will be enough. So, if you have any left, I'm willing to buy them at a high price."After saying that, Gu Muqing looked at Xu Qing. Her clear and bright pupils, curved willow brows, and long eyelashes trembled slightly, emitting deep anticipation. Xu Qing fell silent. It wasn't impossible to sell it to the other party, but he first had to consider if he would have enough left to upgrade his magic boat.Zhang San, who was at the side, was stunned for a moment. He stood between the two of them and looked at Xu Qing, who was seriously thinking, then at Gu Muqing, who was staring fixedly at him. He suddenly felt that this trip to sea looked like it was not going to happen.In fact, he even got a faint feeling that he seemed to be an extra there.He coughed and was about to speak when Gu Muqing, who was staring at Xu Qing's face, suddenly thought of something and her eyes lit up again."I remember now. You're Xu Qing!"

Chapter 159 Creditor's Visit
It was noon and the sunlight was intense. It was hard for mortals to look directly at the sun hanging high in the sky.Just like Gu Muqing, who was standing under the sunlight. She was extremely radiant, like a fairy.Although the light orange Daoist robe covered her figure, the excellence of her body wasn't something that the robe could completely conceal. The curves were prominent and one could imagine what kind of delicate figure was hidden under the robe.That soft jade-like arm that was exposed outside her sleeve, her beautiful and smooth neck, and her long black hair that was like a waterfall. Coupled with her exquisite, smooth, and tender jade-like skin, she was like the embodiment of beauty.When this beautiful scene fell into Zhang San's eyes, his expression became a little dazed and his face turned red. However, Xu Qing, who was standing in the dark, didn't have any changes in his expression. His gaze coldly sized up the woman's neck.Whether this woman was beautiful or not wasn't important to Xu Qing. This wasn't the first time he had seen her. He hadn't seen many core disciples in the main city, so he could tell at a glance that she was the girl he had met outside the medical shop a few months ago.Back then, they had only brushed past each other but the other party had now called out his name. This caused Xu Qing to be extremely vigilant. He had to confirm if the other party had the strength to threaten his life.After sweeping his gaze over, Xu Qing made a judgment in his heart. If he really attacked, he was confident that he could kill the other party quickly. The other party's cultivation was alright but regardless of whether it was her standing posture or vigilance, she was far inferior to the rogue cultivators of the Sea Lizard Island.As for the other party's identity as a core disciple of the Second Peak, considering that the Second Peak focused on alchemy, Xu Qing instinctively scanned his surroundings to see if there were any traces of poison."Junior Brother Xu Qing, you don't have to be surprised. I learned of your name by accident." Gu Muqing smiled sweetly. Her voice was clear and pleasant to the ears.Zhang San's heartbeat sped up. He felt that this woman was indeed worthy of being the publicly acknowledged heavenly maiden of the Second Peak. Such a person calling him senior brother made him feel extremely comfortable.He laughed and was about to say something when Xu Qing's calm voice rang out."I'm not surprised.""Uh‚Ä¶" Zhang San glanced at Xu Qing and sighed inwardly. 'Xu Qing, oh Xu Qing. She is already so proactive, but why don't you have any reaction?' If it were him, he would definitely go forward and chat with her immediately. Wouldn't it be like fate?Gu Muqing smiled lightly and took out a pill, handing it to Xu Qing."Junior Brother Xu Qing, all of your white pills were sold to my shop. I've studied your pills for a long time and am very curious why the purity of these pills is so high."Xu Qing swept his gaze over and recognized that these were indeed his alchemy pills. After some thought, he didn't answer the other party's question, but took out a few sets of sea lizard skin."Eighth level of Qi Condensation sea lizard skin, 530 spirit stones; ninth level of Qi Condensation sea lizard skin, 960 spirit stones; and 1,430 spirit stones for the perfected Qi Condensation sea lizard skin. How many do you want?"Xu Qing's offer was the selling prices of the shops. He felt that he probably wouldn't be able to get such a price if he sold it to the shops. Since Gu Muqing wanted to buy it, selling it to her was more profitable.Gu Muqing looked at the sea lizard skins and her eyes lit up. However, she didn't buy them immediately. Instead, she continued to ask about what she had said earlier. It was as though her interest had shifted from the sea lizard skins after she recognized Xu Qing.Xu Qing frowned slightly. However, when he thought about how the other party's shop had accepted a lot of his white pills and was about to buy his sea lizard skins, he patiently spoke."During the concoction stage, add some Night Corpse Leading Ox. It will increase some purity."The young girl revealed a look of contemplation. After a long time, she questioned politely. However, the impatience in Xu Qing's heart rose. From what he knew, one couldn't obtain knowledge for free.The other party's actions were a little too much.Senior Sister Ding understood this very well. Every time she asked, she would give him something of a certain value.Hence, Xu Qing didn't answer. Instead, he asked about the Dao of medicine."Is there a way to increase the toxicity and preserve the blue blood of the Ghost Desires for a longer time?"Gu Muqing thought about it and spoke seriously."I've never thought about this. What Master taught me is all about healing medicine. Let me think‚Ä¶ If it was me, I would add the living tea and use its depth to increase the toxicity of the Ghost Desire."Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. After pondering for a moment, his state of mind fluctuated slightly. The other party's words opened up some ideas for him, so he asked again."The living tea itself is a neutralization agent but it also contains a certain amount of poison. How can I turn the poison into a medicinal catalyst?""Ah? Poison again? Let me think‚Ä¶ Maybe you can use the golden button grass to force it out?" Gu Muqing said uncertainly but her words still inspired Xu Qing.This caused Xu Qing's interest to increase. He began to communicate with Gu Muqing about the Dao of Medicine. The conversation between the two of them was a little strange. Xu Qing mostly asked about the Dao of Poison, and Gu Muqing mostly asked about the Dao of Medicine.However, it didn't affect anything, instead, there was a faint sense of corroboration between them. In fact, the more they communicated, the more they understood. In the end, Gu Muqing simply walked into the shade and continued to communicate with Xu Qing.Time passed.Under the sunlight, the two people in the darkness -the handsome man and the exquisite woman- made a beautiful scene. Only Zhang San, who looked like a farmer, seemed to be a little out of place in this scene.At this moment, Zhang San was dumbfounded as he stared blankly at the two of them. After a long while, he let out a long sigh and thought to himself that being handsome was really too much of an advantage.His heart skipped a beat again as he wondered if this business would be ruined. However, when he thought about how Xu Qing had just returned from the sea and there was a high chance that he wouldn't go out again, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still couldn't help but speak."Um‚Ä¶ Junior Brother Xu Qing, why don't you give me the magic boat first? I'll refine it for you. I think your conversation will last for a while."When Xu Qing heard this, he cupped his fists toward Zhang San and took out the swift boat.Zhang San subconsciously raised his hand and took the small bottle containing the flying ship. His eyes suddenly widened as he stared blankly at the thin and broken swift boat in the bottle. He was stunned for a moment."Where's the magic boat? Isn't this the swift boat I placed in your magic boat?""It shattered," Xu Qing calmly said. He then continued to ask Gu Muqing about the Dao of Poison.Zhang San took a deep breath and looked at the small bottle in his hand. He already realized that Xu Qing had probably encountered a life-and-death situation on this trip to the sea.Just like that, four hours passed.The afterglow of the setting sun scattered down and the darkness on the ground blended with the light from the outside world. Under Gu Muqing's unsatisfied gaze, Xu Qing ended the conversation and completed the transaction of the sea lizard skins with the other party. "Junior Brother Xu Qing, thank you for clearing my doubts. It's a little late today, so I'll take my leave first. I'll go back and try the method you mentioned. However, I feel that there's a high chance that it will still be very difficult to succeed. In reality, I've tried many times before but I can only occasionally reach that purity."Gu Muqing said in distress.Xu Qing thought about it. On one hand, he felt that this should be related to the concoction method taught by Grandmaster Bai. On the other hand, it might also be related to the fact that his body didn't have any anomalous substances.When he was refining pills, he didn't emit any impure aura that fused into the pills.However, he naturally wouldn't say this.Gu Muqing shook her head and left with a pondering expression.Xu Qing bowed slightly with a serious expression. He had benefited greatly from this exchange and had gained a deeper understanding of the Dao of Poison. A faint idea of how to refine poison appeared in his mind.Seeing that Gu Muqing had left, Zhang San came to Xu Qing's side and sighed with a worried expression."Xu Qing, that boat of yours‚Ä¶ isn't easy to refine. I can't put that many spirit stones on it. It will be the same as building another one. It's too expensive."Xu Qing didn't say anything. He looked around and took out one of the three pieces of divine lizard skin.Zhang San only glanced at the lizard skin from the corner of his eyes before his entire body trembled. In that instant, all his worries disappeared. His eyes widened as he looked at the golden light on the lizard skin, and gasped."What‚Ä¶" Just as he said this, he grabbed Xu Qing and headed straight for his warehouse. After entering the warehouse, he shakily took Xu Qing's lizard skin.After examining it carefully as though it was a treasure, his breathing became increasingly hurried. After a while, he looked at Xu Qing. "Divine lizard skin!""It's even a Foundation Building lizard skin. Moreover, it contains a trace of the aura of Golden Core. The value of this thing is too high. If this matter is revealed, it will definitely cause a large number of fights and killings. How did you obtain it?!""I snatched it. Is it enough to forge a new magic boat?" Xu Qing calmly asked.Looking at Xu Qing's expression, Zhang San's eyes narrowed. He could hear the thick bloodlust in those words and finally understood why he went out on a magic boat and returned on the swift boat."It is more than enough. The magic boat forged from this thing will reach an astonishing level. I need some time to prepare. Come and collect it tomorrow!"Zhang San turned his head to look at the divine lizard skin, and his eyes revealed an intense light. He felt that the magic boat forged from this item would be his most outstanding work in the past few years.Xu Qing nodded and took out some spirit tickets worth about 5,000 spirit stones. After placing them to the side, he thought about it and took out the spirit stones in his storage bag. Altogether, there were 10,000 spirit stones.Many of those spirit stones were stained with blood. n(ovelbin[.]nEt These spirit stones caused Zhang San's eyes to narrow again. His heart skipped a beat and his expression became increasingly strange. He couldn't help but ask."How many people did you kill this time?""Not much." Xu Qing shook his head."If you use all your spirit stones to refine the magic boat, what will happen to your cultivation needs? Also‚Ä¶ do you trust me that much?" Zhang San looked at Xu Qing."Someone still owes me a few thousand spirit stones. I'll go and ask for them tonight. As for trust, I feel Senior Brother's things here add up to more than my harvest."Xu Qing spoke seriously and cupped his fists at Zhang San. He then turned and left cleanly.It was dusk outside and the world was getting dark. Zhang San looked at Xu Qing's back view as he walked away, his heart filled with emotions."There's actually someone who dares to owe this person spirit stones? Also‚Ä¶ since you trust me so much, it won't be good for me to secretly take some of it. Since I've invested in you, I'll persevere to the end!"At the same time, in an inn on Panquan Road, the old man was happily smoking a pipe with a smug expression."I'm rich this time. The mid-stage Foundation Building lizard skin is worth 5,000 spirit stones. It's a pity that I didn't manage to obtain the divine lizard skin.""However, that poisonous brat probably won't have it easy either. He might even end up empty-handed.""I'm so happy when I think about how he didn't gain anything. Haha, I haven't opened for business for many days. There will definitely be many people coming to stay today. Double joy."Just as the old man was feeling smug, a huge force rushed over.It was that large snake. At that moment, it ruthlessly slammed into the old man's body and let out an indignant gurgling sound.The old man glared and was about to teach it a lesson when he saw the large snake's sad expression. His heart softened and he sighed."Sigh, that kid is very cunning. Seeing that the situation isn't good, how can he not run? He won't die, he won't die."When the snake heard this, its emotions eased a little. However, it was still a little dispirited and curled up in a corner.The old man's heart ached and he comforted it. When the sky outside completely darkened, the figures of guests in the distance could be seen."I'll get you some snacks later. Let's not talk about it for now. We're going to open for business."The old man hurriedly walked out and looked at the guests who had arrived in the distance. A smile appeared on his face but at the next instant, his expression suddenly changed.A dagger that shone with a cold light whistled over like lightning from afar the instant the night fell. It directly pierced through the neck of the wanted criminal who was about to enter the inn and nailed him to the wall at the side.The force was so great that the wall let out a loud sound and blood splattered everywhere.A mournful cry rang out before stopping abruptly!Only the sound of footsteps could be heard from afar.

Chapter 160 Bizarre Inn (1)
In the dark night, the wind blew and the moonlight felt cold.The thick night was like a hand that represented death holding the brush of the Life and Death Book, painting everything in hazy ink and forming a picture of death.Everything was grayish-black.Only the blood dripping from the wound on the wanted criminal's neck became the most shocking color in this grayish-black world.This lasted until the gentle footsteps echoed and a gray figure slowly walked into the painting. It replaced the glare of the blood and became the most intense cold outside the inn on Panquan Road.This cold seemed to cause the dripping blood to freeze for a moment. It also made the eyes of the old man at the entrance of the inn narrow as he looked at the figure walking over. His black hair draped over his shoulders and his slender figure was tall and straight. His cold gaze coupled with his well-defined face was like a blade that was slowly being unsheathed.It was Xu Qing.His expression was calm. Under the gaze of the old man from Panquan Road, he walked step by step to the side of the corpse. He removed the corpse's leather pouch and expressionlessly slashed out his dagger. He caught the head of the corpse and kicked the decapitated body lightly.The corpse landed at the old man's feet.The old man's expression was gloomy but the sound of wind could be heard from behind him. The head of the large snake whistled out. The moment it saw Xu Qing, its eyes clearly revealed some light."Gurgle, gurgle.""It's my treat." Xu Qing glanced at the snake and calmly spoke.The large snake was very happy. It swallowed the corpse in one gulp and nodded at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, don't go too far!" The old man from Panquan Road stared fixedly at Xu Qing as he coldly spoke.Xu Qing also looked at the old man but his right hand suddenly waved. Immediately, the dagger in his hand shot into the distance, breaking through the wind and emitting a sharp whistling sound. It replaced the screams and nailed the space between the brows of another wanted criminal who was speeding over.The tremendous force caused this person's skull to shatter. As red and white splattered down at the same time, his body was swept back by the force by twenty feet and landed heavily on the ground.The old man's brows twitched. He could sense that the Xu Qing in front of him seemed to be even more powerful than when he was on the Sea Lizard Island. He felt worried."What exactly do you want?!" The old man glared at Xu Qing angrily, and the veins on his face bulged. A sense of danger spread out from his body, and ropes appeared out of thin air in the surroundings. However, at the instant they appeared, a fiery force erupted from Xu Qing's body, forming a high temperature that swept in all directions. Immediately, the ropes bent one after another, not daring to get close.A tragic cry suddenly rang out from not far away.That was the third wanted criminal who came here. Just by approaching this place, his entire body turned greenish-black and he died from the poison.Xu Qing didn't bother with these dead wanted criminals. He looked at the old man's neck and weighed whether he could kill him. His aura gradually became colder and colder.The old man stared at Xu Qing and felt stifled. He naturally knew the other party's motive for coming here but his heart really ached at the thought of giving away a few thousand spirit stones. When he asked earlier, he planned to use the excuse that he had given him a storage bag as a reason to not give spirit stones.However, Xu Qing didn't say a word. The old man understood that it was useless for him to speak, especially since the other party's aura already contained killing intent. The old man's heart began to thump as he felt a life-and-death crisis."Xu Qing, don't be rash. I have a trump card!! The trump card is this inn. It only looks like an inn but in reality, it's a <anno data-annotation-id="045957cb-c2df-4a34-a373-ab674406df03">bizarre</anno> entity. It's currently in a deep sleep. Once it wakes up, the Seven Blood Eyes' First Peak will immediately come to suppress it. At that time, you'll be finished as well!!"The old man spoke extremely quickly. After he finished speaking, the entire inn rumbled. A terrifying fluctuation spread out from the tables, chairs, and all the bricks of the inn. It was as though the inn had become a monster and was about to awaken.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. The sense of danger he felt at this moment was extremely intense and he instantly took a few steps back.As for the large snake, it had been lying in the distance the entire time and watching curiously. It did not help anyone as though it believed that the two of them wouldn't fight. It sensed the changes in the inn but its expression seemed to reveal a hint of intimacy. Its head rubbed against the ground as though it was greeting the inn. n(ovelbin[.]nEt However, after sensing that Xu Qing was looking at it, it hurriedly gurgled and nodded continuously, as though it was telling Xu Qing that the old man was speaking the truth."Xu Qing, I'm not a human. This inn isn't just an inn. It's a bizarre entity, and my race has the ability to put bizarre entities to sleep.""Many years ago, I brought the sleeping entity to the Seven Blood Eyes to sell it to the First Peak. However, the First Peak didn't give me money immediately and asked me to guard this bizarre entity for ten years. I had no choice. The amount they promised me was too much, so I agreed. However, I'm still poor and I still have to spend my own resources to cultivate.""Also, Huang Yan and I are good friends. I saved Zhang San's life and the captain of Team Six and I are life-and-death friends. Xu Qing, don't be rash. We can also become good friends. The clues I gave you about the wanted criminals before were real. I didn't want to harm you."Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. He looked at the old man who was quickly explaining and then at the inn. In the darkness of the night, the inn seemed to have transformed into a ghastly mouth that could devour everything.He knew that this old man wasn't simple and definitely had a life-saving method which was why he didn't make a move previously. However, he still didn't expect that the old man's trump card would be the inn itself!<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="045957cb-c2df-4a34-a373-ab674406df03">bizarre/strange (ËØ°ÂºÇ) usually means related to supernatural stuffs like ghosts or unexplainable entities.</li></ol></annotations>",
