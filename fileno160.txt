The moonlight scattered onto the surface of the sea, landing on the magic boat with the collapsed protective array. It also landed on Xu Qing's side. He listened to the respectful voices of the Seventh Peak's disciples outside with a dazed expression.Although the breakthrough this time was within his expectations, the dangers in the process made his heart palpitate at this moment. This was especially so when he thought of the feeling of his body wanting to shatter when he broke through with the Mountains and Seas Art. Xu Qing couldn't help but take a deep breath.If it wasn't for the recovery ability of the purple crystal, his body would probably have collapsed and died before the Ba shadow could appear. However, the increase in strength from such a dangerous situation was equally shocking.The Ba shadow above his head was slowly dissipating and the terrifying power surging forth from it caused Xu Qing to reveal a hint of anticipation.A long time later, Xu Qing walked out of the cabin. Under the moonlight, he stood tall and straight like a pine tree. His handsome face had a hint of coldness to it, as though it was carved from stone. There was a mystical charm to it that vaguely hinted a breakthrough in the Mountains and Seas Art."Thank you, fellow disciples." Standing in the boat, Xu Qing calmly cupped his fists and bowed to the surrounding disciples.Immediately, the surrounding disciples on the magic boats returned the greeting. It was as though they could tell that the fluctuations from Xu Qing's cultivation hadn't dissipated. Hence, most of them guessed that this breakthrough wasn't the outcome of simply tonight's cultivation.After returning the greeting, everyone sensibly returned to their cabins and didn't disturb Xu Qing.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  This scene would have been inconceivable if it was a few months ago when Xu Qing had just arrived at the Seven Blood Eyes. But now, it had appeared.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and returned to the cabin. He sat down cross-legged and glanced at the spirit stone that was filled with cracks in the spirit gathering array. He then glanced at the dilapidated cabin and frowned slightly.He knew that the collapse of the protective barrier was due to the huge fluctuation that erupted in that instant. As the core of the barrier, the spirit stones couldn't withstand it and shattered."I wonder if the next breakthrough of the Mountains and Seas Art will still be like this..."Xu Qing mumbled. His heart still palpitated, but he felt even more heartache. After all, repairing the magic boat required money.However, when he thought of the harvest he gained from killing the merfolk youth, he felt slightly better.Now wasn't the time to care about these. Xu Qing calmed the palpitations in his heart from breaking through with the Mountains and Seas Art. He could sense that his Sea Transformation Art was rumbling and churning in his body, as though it was about to break through as well.He took a deep breath and replaced the useless spirit stone in the spirit gathering array with a new one.At the next moment, the protective barrier on the magic boat was activated again.Looking at the moonlight falling from the damaged cabin, Xu Qing pondered for a moment before deciding to put in another spirit stone. As he performed a series of hand seals, the magic boat rumbled. With the two spirit stones as the core, the protective barrier was even thicker. It was so thick that even the moonlight was obscured.Xu Qing closed his eyes. He then sensed that the amount of boundless energy bursting forth from his body at this moment was several times greater than before. One had to know that Xu Qing's previous strength was already at the level of perfection in the Mountains and Seas Art. Now that he had broken through, it was like he had broken some sort of shackles, allowing his physical strength to reach an even higher level.This power was so strong that Xu Qing had a feeling that even without using the Sea Transformation Art's spell, he would be able to frighten Diamond Sect's ancestor with just a full-strength punch from the Mountains and Seas Art.After all, he was the first person in history to cultivate the Mountains and Seas Art to such an extent.Before him, Kui shadow was already the limit. Now that the Kui shadow had transformed into an unprecedented Ba, not only did it contain the aura of the mountains and seas, but it also contained endless scorching flames.The madness that wanted to evaporate all moisture and burn all living beings was still lingering in Xu Qing's perception.And this was only the eighth level. The Ba shadow was only newborn and hadn't reached the complete state. Xu Qing couldn't imagine what it would look like after the ninth level. Also, when the art reached the tenth level, would the Ba shadow transform?No one could guide him on the path of the Mountains and Seas Art. Even the person who created this cultivation art couldn't do it.Xu Qing fell silent. After a long time, a glint flashed in his eyes. He closed his eyes again and began to circulate the Sea Transformation Art.Time slowly passed. Two hours later, the wind stirred in Port 79...This wind blew across the surface of the sea and gathered on Xu Qing's magic boat, forming a vortex. It was like a black hole that swept the spirit energy from all directions over with rumbling sounds.The surface of the sea swayed, and all the boats were swaying. The Seventh Peak's disciples also focused their attention on the source of all this, as though they wanted to witness Xu Qing's rise.Boundless spirit energy rushed into Xu Qing's boat from all directions and into his body. The spirit sea formed by the Sea Transformation Art in his body soared in all directions.The increase in each level of the Sea Transformation Art seemed to only increase the spirit sea by 100 feet, but in reality, this increase was in all aspects. Regardless of length or depth, it was like the difference between a small circle and a large circle.The depth was even more so. Xu Qing already had the foundation to break through and now that the spirit energy that contained the aura of the forbidden sea arrived, his body instantly rumbled. Waves of cracking sounds echoed in his mind and the spirit sea in Xu Qing's body expanded abruptly.The spirit sea directly broke through the last ten feet and reached 800 feet. The instant it reached 800 feet, Xu Qing's body trembled violently. Endless spirit energy quickly filled up the additional ten feet and it wasn't over. It was still expanding.820 feet, 830 feet, 840 feet...Only when it reached 870 feet did the spirit sea in Xu Qing's body feel saturated. As Xu Qing opened his eyes, amidst the dazzling purple light, there was an increasingly obvious extraordinariness.

Chapter 132 Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale (2)
"Dragonwhale." Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and mumbled as he waved his right hand. Immediately, a dragon roar rang out from his body and a gigantic head that looked like a dragon or a whale drilled out of Xu Qing's chest.It was completely black and gave off an extremely profound feeling. At the same time, it emitted a shocking aura.It roared and rushed out of Xu Qing's body and grew larger and larger. It broke through the protective barrier and charged into the sky. As it roared at the sky, its entire body was revealed!Its huge body that was 800 feet long emitted a soul-stirring aura. Each of its fluttering tentacles emitted a blue fluorescent light.With its appearance, the surface of the sea instantly rumbled, as though it was attracted by it and formed a huge wave. As for this dragonwhale, even if it only slammed down, it was enough to cause earthquakes and floods.The disciples on the surrounding magic boats were all shocked."Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale!""This is a special spell of the eighth level of the Sea Transformation Art. However, not everyone can form a Dragonwhale at the eighth level. This requires extreme mastery!""The physical strength Xu Qing emitted earlier was already shocking. Now, his spell has actually reached the eighth level…""Such combat strength…"Everyone gasped.Xu Qing was still sitting cross-legged on the magic boat. He looked at the dragonwhale moving in the sky, his eyes revealing an intense light. He had been waiting for this day.According to the records in the Sea Transformation Art, when one cultivated it to the eighth level, one's 800-foot-high spirit sea could transform into a Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale. This dragonwhale was formed by a spell and would exist forever. It would swim in the sea and accompany the Seventh Peak's disciple's boat.This allowed the disciples of the Seventh Peak to obtain even greater help when they went out to sea.However, to form the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale, the cultivator needed extreme mastery over the art, not all eighth level disciples could accomplish it."I've finally reached this level." As Xu Qing mumbled, with a thought, the dragonwhale that was growling in the air suddenly swayed and landed on the surface of the sea, stirring up a large amount of seawater. Its figure also fused into the sea and disappeared.Only Xu Qing could condense its figure in the sea with a thought.The existence of the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale was actually a watershed for the Seventh Peak's disciples!"If I encounter the Diamond Sect's ancestor at sea now, there's a high chance that I can kill him!" A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes."Even if the battle is not on the sea, I will have a chance of heavily injuring the Diamond Sect's ancestor if I spare no expense!""Now, I have to head out to sea first. I have to temper my cultivation and gather resources. When I return, I will think of ways to kill the Diamond Sect's ancestor as soon as possible!""I'll go and increase the level of my magic boat at dawn. If it is refined quickly, I'll set off tomorrow. If it is late, I'll head out to sea the day after tomorrow!" Xu Qing took a deep breath. He could sense that his shadow had become more agile with the double breakthrough in his cultivation and body.This made him even more confident.At the same time as Xu Qing's Dragonwhale formed and roared, its roar spread throughout the ports, so many disciples from the other ports also heard it.This sound was very special. Outsiders might not be able to tell but to the Seventh Peak's disciples, they were familiar with it."Someone else has reached the eighth level and even formed the dragonwhale. This aura isn't ordinary… Interesting."In Port 32, in the Coast Guard Department, a huge departmental battleship was slowly sailing out of the harbor. Unlike the magic boats of the other disciples, the battleship of the Coast Guard Department was specially made by the sect.A gray-robed youth stood on the battleship. This youth's entire body emitted powerful fluctuations. Under his blue hair were golden eyes. He stared into the distance and muttered. "Senior Brother Ding, do you need us to make some inquiries?" Seven to eight Coast Guard Department disciples followed behind him. At that moment, one of them spoke in a low voice.Zhou Qingpeng was among them. He was at the back, wearing a cautious expression.Clearly, he had accomplished what he had said at the gathering that day and was introduced to the heaven chosen of the Coast Guard Department. It was the blue-haired youth, he was none other than Ding Xiaohai, who was known as the number one Qi Condensation cultivator on the Seventh Peak. Even some core disciples had to treat him as a fellow Daoist."Let's talk about it after we return," Ding Xiaohai said calmly and retracted his gaze.At the same time, in the Homicide Department, the captain of Team Six was lying comfortably on a chair. He held a rare pentagon-shaped fruit in his hand and was happily eating a corner. He seemed to have sensed something as he looked toward the direction of Port 79 and smiled."This is because his mood is clear, so he broke through. It's simple and direct. This kid… I like him, but he's still a little weak. How can my team member be so weak? Should I find him a few more people to kill?"The captain of Team Six was indeed the pervert that Zhang San had mentioned. He actually put down the fruit and seriously pondered over this question.On this night, Xu Qing's dragonwhale attracted the attention of many people on the Seventh Peak, causing people to have mixed feelings. Some were filled with anticipation, some were envious, and some were jealous.However, there were also people who were extremely angry and sad but couldn't find an outlet to vent their anger.They were the cultivators of the merfolk race.At this moment, in the alley where the merfolk youth died, several figures appeared. The two people in front, one tall and one short, were none other than the older sisters of the merfolk youth, and were also the third highness' lovers.Among them, the elder sister seemed very calm, but the younger sister beside her was trembling. Her breathing was hurried and the glands on her face were standing up. Her eyes revealed monstrous killing intent.At the side, there was an old man from the merfolk race. He stood there bitterly and spoke in a low voice.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  "His Highness' aura disappeared here, but the traces have all been dealt with. However, with His Highness' strength and identity, there's a high chance that he isn't dead. He just disappeared, I wonder if his life slip in the clan…""His Highness' life slip has… shattered." Before the old man could finish speaking, the younger sister of the two merfolk women gritted her teeth and spoke.The old man fell silent and his face gradually turned pale.As a Dao Protector, he knew what his end would be. However, it was His Highness' request that he was strictly not allowed to follow, and he also had roughly guessed His Highness' hobby.However, no matter what, he never expected such a thing to happen…"Could it be the higher-ups of the Seven Blood Eyes?" The old man hesitated."If the higher-ups of the Seven Blood Eyes wanted to kill, do they need to hide it?""Continue investigating, especially since His Highness has a wish box in his storage bag. This item is extremely important and can't fall into the hands of others." Among the merfolk women, the elder sister took a deep breath and coldly spoke."Sister, His Highness has fallen, we must take revenge for His Highness. Why are you still paying attention to the wish box!!" The younger sister glared at her angrily."You should know the importance of the wish box. That's a gift from the previous era.""I only know that His Highness has fallen. We have to find the murderer!"The two sisters' gazes met. After a long time, the older sister calmly spoke."You take revenge and I'll take the box. We can do this both. As a member of the royal family, His Highness has the Bloodline Mark on him. If we encounter a killer at close range, we will sense it.""Now, go and search for everyone who had conflicts with His Highness during this period of time, including the families of the people he killed. We have to search and investigate them one by one. I really want to know who has the guts to kill my race's young master!""After I find him, I'll torture him and make him and his entire family wish they were dead. They'll wail in pain and their souls will be stuffed into the fish and prawns. I'll bite them into pieces and swallow them alive!!" The younger sister gritted her teeth and revealed madness in her eyes.

Chapter 133 Zhang San's Investment (1)
To most people in the Seven Blood Eyes, this night was no different from usual. However, to some people, it was a little different.Some sighed with emotion. They envied him for being extraordinary.Some were furious and swore to tear him into pieces.Someone was sitting in a rocking chair, and the fruit pits beside him had piled like a hill.Someone in the inn felt bitter and panicked.Sometimes, to judge whether a person had integrated into the environment, you didn't have to look at their achievements or actions, but look at how many people's emotions they could stir.The envious disciples in Port 79, the hysterical merfolk cultivators, the captain of Team Six who had a mountain of fruit pits piled beside him, and the flustered Diamond Sect's ancestor.However, no matter what, when the morning light scattered down, the thoughts of the night also slowly faded. It was like people left the scene after dancing merrily the whole night.Hence, when the morning light scattered down from the dilapidated cabin and reflected outside Xu Qing's eyelids, he opened his eyes and fused the energy in his eyelids with the brightness of the outside world.His eyes, which were revealed under the sunlight, were sparkling. Just like the morning sun outside, they were filled with anticipation for the future."I wonder if the morning on the sea will have a different charm," Xu Qing mumbled softly. There was yearning in the depths of his eyes as he stood up.He had many things to do today.Firstly, he had to make a trip to the Homicide Department to apply for a long leave for the trip out to sea. This process wasn't complicated in the Homicide Department. Most of the time, the disciples of the Seventh Peak weren't at the port. Since they cultivated the sea, they naturally had to go out to sea.After he came to the Homicide Department to report, Xu Qing completed a series of procedures and obtained a 40-day leave. If he returned early, he could cancel the remaining leave. If the time was delayed, he could also make up for it later.It was still early when he finished all these, but Xu Qing's pace didn't slow down. He went to the shops of the Sixth Peak. Although the previous event was not likely to happen again, he had no choice but to be wary. Hence, he spent some effort searching for a shop.However, in the end, Xu Qing still hesitated. He looked at a shop and was about to enter when the captain's voice transmission came in his identity token."Xu Qing, have you forgotten something?"Xu Qing started as he pondered."Forget it, I'll make it clear. Xu Qing, when are you going to return the 500 spirit stones you owe me?"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he replied."100 spirit stones!""Alright, alright. I won't argue with you so much. 300 it is. When are you going to give it to me?"Xu Qing fell silent and took out the bamboo slip with the enemy's names engraved on it. He then crossed out the question mark behind the word 'captain'."Why aren't you saying anything? I saw that you , kid, applied for leave from the department. Don't tell me you're going out to sea to escape your debt? Forget it, forget it. It's very dangerous to go out to sea and it demands a lot from the magic boat. In order to not let you die outside and cause my 500 spirit stones to go down the drain, let me remind you that you should look for Zhang San to refine the magic boat!""Zhang San?" Xu Qing was a little puzzled. When he spoke of Zhang San, the captain seemed to have gotten more interested. He gave some pointers in the voice transmission and even told Xu Qing how to react and speak before ending the voice transmission.Xu Qing stood and pondered for a long time. In the end, he looked for Zhang San from the Transportation Department with doubts.When he arrived at the Transportation Department, Zhang San was squatting on a pile of goods and smoking a pipe. Like an old man, his expression was tranquil as he enjoyed the flavor of tobacco and sunlight. From time to time, he would shout a few times to instruct the handymen of the Transportation Department to work.When he saw Xu Qing's figure, Zhang San's eyelids narrowed slightly. After sizing him up carefully, his eyes lit up."Ah, how is Junior Brother Xu so free to come to my place today?"Xu Qing walked closer and looked at Zhang San, who was squatting on the goods. He then leaped onto the goods as well. However, this time, before he could approach a certain distance, Zhang San quickly moved further away.Xu Qing glanced at Zhang San and squatted down.Zhang San smiled as he looked at Xu Qing under the sunlight, especially his side profile that was enough to make the opposite sex infatuated. He couldn't help but mutter a few words in his heart but his expression didn't reveal it at all."It's better to squat down.""Mm." Xu Qing nodded."What's the matter?" please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Senior Brother Zhang, I want to refine and upgrade my magic boat.""Refining a magic boat? Who told you to look for me? Your captain?" Zhang San was stunned.Xu Qing didn't say anything. He took out two apples and gave one to Zhang San.Zhang San instinctively took the apple. After he held it in his hand, he suddenly regretted it and wanted to return it. However, Xu Qing didn't take it.Zhang San smiled bitterly, and a hint of contemplation slowly appeared in his eyes. After weighing the apple in his hand, he looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing tilted his head and looked at him.A long time later, Zhang San suddenly laughed."Promise me one thing and I'll help you refine it.""Senior Brother Zhang, please speak." Xu Qing noticed the words in the other party's words. He wasn't going to look for someone to refine the magic boat, but was personally refining it. "When you look at me in the future, can you not stare at my neck? It's such a hot day, but I feel cold." Zhang San winked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing thought about it and shifted his gaze to look into Zhang San's eyes.Zhang San patted his head and sighed."Your gaze always makes me feel strange. It's as though the area you look at will be injured. Forget it, forget it. It's very rare for you to change your gaze. I'll help you refine it. However, I'll say this in advance. My refinement is very expensive…" As he spoke, Zhang San jumped down from the goods and waved at Xu Qing.

Chapter 134 Zhang San's Investment (2)
Xu Qing stood up and cupped his fists as he followed. Very soon, the two of them arrived at the back of the Transportation Department. There was a huge warehouse there. When he pushed open the door of the warehouse, the light formed by countless refining materials spread out resplendently.Xu Qing was stunned. He noticed that the types and quality of the materials inside were extraordinary, especially when he saw seven to eight broken magic boats. There was even a half-baked battleship from the Coast Guard Department that was being assembled in the distance…There were also boats from other races scattered in all directions. All of this made him involuntarily gasp. In a daze, he felt as though he had gone to the shops on the Sixth Peak.He couldn't help but look at the smug Zhang San."How is it? Let me tell you, among the entire Seventh Peak's disciples, I'm not good at fighting and my cultivation level is average. However, when it comes to refining boats, hmph, there aren't many Sixth Peak's disciples who are better at it than me. The items in the dozen or so warehouses in the surroundings are all my works." Zhang San placed his hands behind his back and spoke proudly."Also, no one dares to snatch them!""Senior Brother Zhang is really a disciple of the Seventh Peak?" Xu Qing hesitated for a moment and recalled the captain's words. Hence, he tried his best to widen his eyes and put on a stunned expression as he asked."Your captain asked the same question back then. Hahaha, it's a pity that I discovered my talent too late. Otherwise, I would be a core disciple of the Sixth Peak now." Zhang San enjoyed Xu Qing's expression very much and felt very comfortable."Let me see your magic boat."Respect appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He took out the small bottle which contained his magic boat and handed it over. After Zhang San took it and swept his gaze over it, he frowned slightly but didn't say anything. Just as he was about to take it to refine, Xu Qing hesitated for a moment. He then thought of the words his captain had imparted to him and spoke."Third Senior Brother Zhang, I think my magic boat is not bad. Many places inside have reached a high standard.""Not bad? High standard?" Zhang San stopped in his tracks and his brows furrowed, forming an inverted '八' shape."Your boat is a mess. Forget about the materials, the technique is extremely bad. Also, there are flaws in the array formation on both sides of the ship.""The scales are not stuck properly either. They have destroyed the structure of the magic boat. This will definitely affect the spirit gathering array. One look and I can tell that it was refined by those trash disciples of the Sixth Peak.""There's also the bow and stern of the boat. This is a level six boat, not level one. The focus isn't on the shape but the internal substance… Why is it made so gorgeously? To attract the enemy?!""Practicality is the best choice.""Trash, the refinement is too trashy. It's fine if you don't go out to sea, but once you take it to sea and encounter a storm or a large sea monster, it won't have enough strength, firmness, stability, and reliability. It's already the limit if it can maintain a certain watertightness."Zhang San looked at the magic boat in the small bottle and criticized.When Xu Qing heard this, his heart trembled. He felt that the other party's words were very professional. He became even more respectful and cupped his fists and bowed to Zhang San.Seeing Xu Qing like this, Zhang San felt smug and very comfortable. He liked to see those fellow disciples who were usually respected by others admire him in his profession. Back then, the captain was like this, although he had lost a lot of spirit stones after the incident…He originally didn't want to criticize this time around and only planned to refine it simply. However, Xu Qing's 'not bad' remark made him unable to hold his words in.Zhang San didn't have any ill intentions. What he said was correct. For ordinary disciples, it wouldn't be a problem to take such a magic boat to sea. However, Xu Qing's combat strength determined that he would challenge stronger sea beasts and head to more dangerous areas. In that case, such a magic boat was naturally not suitable."Judging from what you want, it should be sturdiness. Let me help you with it. I guarantee that when you take the magic boat to the sea, even if you encounter an impact from a giant beast, as long as the giant beast hasn't reached the Foundation Building realm, your magic boat will be able to withstand it multiple times. Even if it shatters, it will be very difficult for it to disintegrate!" Zhang San waved his hand proudly. "Thank you, Senior Brother." Xu Qing's expression was solemn. After that, he took out the spirit stones from his pouch."I have 200 spirit stones here and I need to reserve some for my trip to the sea. I wonder…" Xu Qing was a little hesitant. He felt that his spirit stones shouldn't be enough.Zhang San's eyes swept over and then looked at Xu Qing. The words of the captain of Team Six and what he had seen and heard in the Sixth Peak's shop surfaced in his mind. He then thought of the dragonwhale's cry last night and the spirit energy fluctuations he had sensed from the other party earlier. Finally, he thought of the straightforward criticism he had given earlier and the comfort he had obtained. Hence, he endured his heartache and pretended to be relaxed."That's enough. You might have a bright future. Back then, I invested in your captain. Let me consider this as an investment too. Come and collect it tonight." As Zhang San spoke, he began to get busy.Xu Qing lifted his head and cast a deep glance at Zhang San before thanking him solemnly. He then cupped his fists and bowed deeply before leaving.It was only after Xu Qing had walked far away that Zhang San let out a long sigh and muttered with a frown."I've made a loss. Every time I see these people who cultivate quickly, why can't I stop myself from showing off my skills? I could have casually refined it, but now… I have to live up to my words.""Eh, that's not right. Why does this kid's demeanor look a little similar to his captain's… However, his captain is petty. Back then, he didn't give a single spirit stone. This kid has a more conscience than his captain." please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  However, at the end of the day, he knew that he did this because of the captain's recommendation. Secondly, he trusted the captain's judgment."This investment shouldn't be a loss!"Over the years, he was able to go from being truly unknown to being deliberately unknown now. Moreover, he had such wealth and controlled the Transportation Department. The reason why no one came to snatch his wealth was because he had refined a boat for the captain back then.After Xu Qing left the Transportation Department, his expression was strange. He took out the voice transmission jade slip and hesitated for a moment before transmitting his voice to the captain."Captain, is this okay?""You followed what I told you, right?""I did…" "Haha, that's good then. Zhang San is one of us. This guy is a big shot. If you think you have taken advantage of him, help him more in the future."Xu Qing nodded seriously. He took out the bamboo slip and wrote Zhang San's name on the other side. After that, he flipped it over and looked at the side with the enemy engraved on it. He then added a question mark behind the captain again.At this moment, in the Homicide Department, the captain of Team Six was smiling as he ate the strange fruits that couldn't be bought in the main city. They were only produced on islands of the nonhuman races in the sea.After he finished eating, he put down the voice transmission jade slip and picked up a document that reported Zhang San. It mentioned that when Zhang San was out on a mission, he was bloody and brutal and had killed too many people. He also robbed foreign merchant ships. There was strong protest against Zhang San in the document and requested for severe punishment.Glancing at the document, the captain chuckled. With a wave of his hand, the document burned and turned into ashes."My friend, as long as you don't betray me, no one can touch you."

Chapter 135 Newbie Goes Out To Sea
It was noon and the sun was scorching.Xu Qing walked on the streets and told himself that when he could help in the future, he had to help Zhang San to repay the favor he owed him for refining the boat this time. Also, he would repay Zhou Qingpeng for the Ghost Desires when the time was right.Although he hadn't seen the appearance of the magic boat after refining, Xu Qing felt that the spirit stones Zhang San used to refine the magic boat must have far exceeded 200.After memorizing this matter, Xu Qing observed the crowd in the surroundings. He didn't see any difference from the past.It seemed that the death of the merfolk youth didn't cause any waves in the main city. It was the same for the Homicide Department. Of course, it was also possible that not many people knew about it right now.Xu Qing pondered as he walked toward the Sea Records Library in the city.The Sea Records Library was a place every disciple had to go to before they went out to sea for the first time.This was because the Sea Records Library stored extremely precious information. It was a comprehensive record of all sorts of strange things that countless Seven Blood Eyes disciples had experienced when they went out to sea over the years, as well as countless information about sea beasts.Its value was immeasurable.Therefore, the books could not be copied. If someone wanted to check them, they could only personally go over and spend some fees to read the records.Other than that, if a disciple went out to sea and encountered a strange thing or a new sea beast, they could also report it to the Sea Records Library. If it was confirmed to be true, they would be rewarded handsomely. The more precious the information, the richer the reward.However, if there was no conclusive evidence and it was only one-sided information, the review period would usually be extremely long because it was impossible to determine if it was true or false. It wasn't impossible for the review period to last for hundreds of years. This also prevented the occurrence of disciples trying to fabricate stories to get rewards.Unproven information would not be registered in the library.The records that could be listed in the library were all true and had been confirmed many times.Xu Qing read the records very seriously. He knew that any piece of information here might save his life at a critical moment.He was also certain of the direction he should head to in the sea.The nautical chart he found in the merfolk youth's storage bag was very comprehensive and detailed. After Xu Qing studied it, he decided that his ultimate goal for this trip to the sea was an island marked on the map.This island was behind an archipelago called the Western Reef. That place was filled with hidden reefs and was very dangerous. Because it was the place where the nearby sea lizards shed their skin, it was known as Sea Lizard Island.Sea lizards were ferocious and rarely seen. They were social creatures and were mostly in the deep sea. They would only come out of sea when they shed their skin. Moreover, the skin they shed had to be obtained in an extremely short period of time for it to be of value. After a while, their spirituality would dissipate and they would be worthless.Hence, it was extremely difficult for outsiders to obtain it.Moreover, because its defense far surpassed that of similar materials, it was considered a high-tier material among the magic boat materials. It couldn't be compared to mid-tier and low-tier materials. Xu Qing had seen it in the Sixth Peak's shop before. It was just the skin of a sea lizard at the third level of Qi Condensation, but it cost 30 spirit stones per piece.Moreover, the price would skyrocket along with the cultivation of the sea lizard. The fifth level Qi Condensation sea lizard skin already cost 150 spirit stones. Xu Qing had even seen an eighth level Qi Condensation sea lizard skin that was priced at 500 to 600 spirit stones.Such astonishing value caused this Sea Lizard Island to attract the ferocious cultivators of the nonhuman races on the forbidden sea all year round. It was extremely dangerous.If one didn't have a certain level of strength, they would only have a slim chance of survival if they headed there.Xu Qing's target was this Sea Lizard Island.Time slowly passed by as he flipped through the records. Unknowingly, it was already dusk. Xu Qing finally remembered all the contents of the thick book. He closed his eyes and recalled before turning to leave."Everything is ready. I just need to wait for the magic boat." Walking on the streets at dusk, Xu Qing looked at the sea. The sound of waves rang out in his ears and his eyes revealed anticipation.Finally, when dusk was far away and the bright moon rose, Xu Qing arrived at the Transportation Department.The handymen who had been busy for the entire day were leaving in groups. When Xu Qing walked over, he saw Zhang San squatting on the goods and smoking a pipe from afar.Under the dim light, Zhang San's figure was a little blurry. Only the fatigue on his face was revealed through the smoke from the pipe that alternated between dense and thin.Xu Qing felt a little apologetic. Just as he was about to approach, his gaze swept across the surroundings. Among the servant disciples who had become restrained because of his appearance, there was a familiar small and skinny figure.That figure was a girl. It was Li Zimei, who was in the same batch as him. She also saw Xu Qing. Although she was still reserved, a smile still appeared on her face.This smile was very sincere.Xu Qing smiled encouragingly. After watching her leave, he walked to Zhang San's side."You know her?" Zhang San asked curiously."I do. Her name is Li Zimei. She entered the sect in the same batch as me and has a very strong personality." Xu Qing glanced at Li Zimei's back and said softly.Zhang San nodded."Not a bad girl. Since you know her, I'll take care of her later.""Thank you." Xu Qing looked at Zhang San and said solemnly."It's a small thing. Let's go. I'll bring you to see your magic boat." As Zhang San spoke, his eyes revealed spirit. He jumped down from the pile of goods and brought Xu Qing to the back. This time, they went to another large warehouse.As they walked in, a gigantic boat with an astonishing aura entered Xu Qing's vision, causing him to involuntarily stop in his tracks.Even though he was already mentally prepared and knew that the appearance of his boat would change drastically this time around, Xu Qing was still shocked by the magic boat in front of him. The giant crocodile head at the bow of the ship had changed. It was no longer slender but much flatter. However, there was a black horn hidden in its forehead, as though it could pierce through everything once it popped out.This change caused the original ostentatiousness to be restrained. It looked more restrained under which lied cruelty.The changes to the boat were even greater. It was no longer in the shape of a willow leaf that was more than 200 feet long. Instead, its length was reduced and width increased. Overall, it looked like a diamond-shaped turtle shell.Every plank of the boat was covered in scales and densely-packed array patterns.Four huge wheeled legs appeared on both sides. They seemed to be retractable and would allow the boat to move on the shore. There were also sharp thorns hidden on them.At the same time, the changes in the cabins weren't small either. It now looked like a two-story house. This allowed more space for array formations to be carved.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Other than these, what was most eye-catching were the huge saber sails.There were a total of eight of them, four in the front, and four in the back. From afar, they looked like wings but also like sharp blades.As for the bottom of the ship, there was a huge groove that seemed to be able to accommodate sea beasts.The entire magic boat looked like a giant beast in this warehouse. Its aura was heavy and filled with intimidation."Wha…" Xu Qing was a little dazed. The changes to the magic boat were so great that his mind was buzzing at this moment.Upon seeing Xu Qing's appearance, Zhang San's exhausted face revealed joy and pride as he calmly spoke."Your previous magic boat was too badly refined, so I made a major modification for you this time. The main modifications are the bottom structure, shipboard structure, deck structure, bulkhead structure, bow-and-stern structure, the storeyed building, and so on.""I've replaced the keel for you. This way, the stability will be better. The structural adjustment can allow the strength and sturdiness to reach the extreme. Also, I've left some space for you to upgrade."Zhang San leaped onto the magic boat."In the black horn at the bow of the ship, I added the bone marrow of the devouring beast and pierced it into the body of the sea beast. It can devour the target's spirit energy and store it in the deck's formation.""There are also these four legs. Each of them contains 3,600 sharp fragments. If you encounter danger, you can shoot them out.""I didn't touch the spirit gathering array but I increased the groove for you. It can add 50 spirit stones at once. If there are extreme situations, this magic boat can be broken down and the excess parts can be turned into a fishing boat. Its speed will be at least twice as fast." "And these sails." Zhang San pointed at the sails with a proud expression."I created them myself. Take a good look." As Zhang San spoke, he took out a spirit stone and placed it into the array formation under his feet. With a stomp of his foot, the array formation activated. The eight blade-like sails instantly gathered together, forming a protective shell.The magic boat was like a huge alligator turtle that could attack and defend at the same time."In addition to the boat's own defense, these sails can make the boat even sturdier. When they are unfurled, they can be used as sharp blades with extraordinary lethality.""The groove at the bottom of the boat can better lock on the dragonwhale in the Forbidden Sea. Under special circumstances, you can control the dragonwhale to soar and lift the magic boat, allowing it to take off for a short period.""Xu Qing, this is a true level-seven boat. How is it? Are you satisfied?" Zhang San jumped off the magic boat and stood in front of Xu Qing with his hands behind his back. He then lifted his chin and calmly spoke.Waves surged in Xu Qing's heart. After a long time, he took a deep breath and took a few steps back. He then cupped his fists toward Zhang San and bowed deeply."Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang. This boat… I'm very satisfied!""When your magic boat is upgraded to a magic ship later, I'll help you design it according to your power source. A magic ship is a true weapon!"Zhang San spoke calmly with the demeanor of an expert. Xu Qing's attitude made him feel very comfortable, but the rush of fatigue still made him involuntarily yawn.When Xu Qing saw this, he respectfully bade farewell and placed the spirit stones at the side. He then kept the magic boat and left the Transportation Department.Only after he left did Zhang San sigh with a dispirited expression."I've lost money. I couldn't hold it in and actually refined it so well… I've made a huge loss this time.""I hope this kid will be promising in the future…" Zhang San endured the pain and picked up the spirit stones, shaking his head as he left the warehouse. Before he left, he thought of Xu Qing's fellow disciple from the same batch. He took out the voice transmission jade slip and made arrangements."Since I'm already investing, I might as well invest more. I have no choice."As Zhang San sighed with emotion, Xu Qing returned to Port 79 and released his magic boat in its berth. As the water rumbled, he looked at the heavy giant object in front of him and his heart stirred. He leaped onto it and studied it carefully.The night slowly passed.That night, Xu Qing thoroughly studied the interior and exterior of his magic boat. He also felt a high admiration for Zhang San's refinement. When the sun rose and shone down, Xu Qing took a deep breath and stood at the bow of the boat. He looked at the sun in the distance and slowly narrowed his eyes.A long time later, he lifted his right hand and performed a series of hand seals."Set sail!"Immediately, the magic boat rumbled. As the seawater in the surroundings churned, his level-seven magic boat slowly moved from its berth and turned its bow. Under the attention of the other magic boat disciples in the surroundings, it sailed in the direction of the harbor's gate.It was like a giant majestic beast was released from its cage.As for the handsome youth standing on the deck, his long hair fluttered in the sea breeze. His figure was tall and straight like a pine tree, and the sleeves of his gray Daoist robe fluttered in the wind, reflecting the morning sun in the sky, causing the sunlight on his body to pass through his hair and refract into dazzling colors.

Chapter 136 Bronze Dragon Carriage
The sun emitted a dazzling light that pierced into the wild Forbidden Sea, stirring up waves that surged toward the sky and let out low roars.Before the sound dissipated, the waves fell, splashing up a large amount of black water foam that scattered high into the air, landing on the protective barrier of Xu Qing's magic boat.Xu Qing stood at the bow of the boat and looked at the sea warily. He then performed a series of hand seals. As the protective spirit energy fluctuated, the seawater that contained dense anomalous substances slowly dissipated from the surface of the barrier.Just like the god's fragmented face in the sky, this Forbidden Sea that surrounded the entire Nanhuang Continent would always be a domain of awe and veneration. Not only was it vast and far-reaching, but it was also an eternal mystery in everyone's hearts.This mysteriousness caused Xu Qing to lift his head and stare at the distant sky and the Forbidden Sea. In his eyes, the two seemed to have fused together at an unknown point.Compared to the vast sea, the boats that passed through the Seven Blood Eyes were like a few feathers that floated gently and leisurely, insignificant.As for the people on the magic boat, it was even more so.Xu Qing fell silent. He looked into the endless distance and the boundless Forbidden Sea as a feeling of insignificance surfaced in his heart."According to the sea record, most disciples who go out to sea for the first time will feel that they are insignificant. This is a normal change in their hearts. At the same time, they will also produce the thought of conquering the sea."Xu Qing looked at the endless black sea. This was his first time going out to sea and also his first time truly seeing the great sea.However, he didn't have the thought of conquering it.He didn't have any great ideals or vast ambitions. He only wanted to survive in this chaotic world.It would be even better if he could live a little better.Hence, the vigilance in Xu Qing's heart was very intense. Even though he was sitting cross-legged and cultivating, some of his attention was still on guard against his surroundings.Just like that, time flowed amidst the echoing sounds of the waves. This lasted until noon when waves of commotion rang out from behind, attracting Xu Qing's attention.A hint of sharpness flashed in his eyes as he turned his head.It was seven to eight magic boats that came from the direction of the Seven Blood Eyes' harbor. They whistled as they approached, causing a commotion.Other than the one at the front, most of them were at level five or six.As for the magic boat at the front, judging from the spirit energy fluctuations, it was about level eight or nine. It looked rather luxurious. Its entire body was golden and golden feathers were stuck on it that shone brightly.In the black Forbidden Sea, it was exceptionally dazzling. It was ostentatious and tacky like a pheasant trying to learn to fan its tail like a peacock.The bow of the phoenix boat should have contained elegance, but under the golden color and luxury, it lost its soul. It revealed a flaunting aura like it was afraid that others wouldn't be able to see.Looking at all of this, Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and drew his dagger.Although the Seven Blood Eyes' main city was dangerous and cruel, there were at least some rules. For example, Foundation Building cultivators rarely attacked Qi Condensation cultivators in the main city. However, Xu Qing knew that at sea, the strong preyed on the weak.The dangers came from everywhere be it the nonhuman races, the human race, fellow sect members, or the Forbidden Sea itself. If one was unlucky and encountered a nonhuman Foundation Building cultivator with malicious intent, their life and death would be decided with a single thought.Anyone could instantly become an enemy.This was especially so when the arrival of these magic boats was too ostentatious, and the voice of the person he hated came from the phoenix boat.The wind on the sea was a little strong, so the voice did not spread clearly."Senior Sister, many people are curious about how many spirit stones I spent on this phoenix boat. I'm actually not very willing to answer this question because my answer will cause them to feel defeated. After all, you should have sensed it too. Since I was young, spirit stones have been a worry that could never be spent completely.""Actually, it's so-so. For some reason, I have been asked for my opinion many times on boat rankings in the sect. They insisted on raising my boat to 17th place. Anyway, I have never cared about these.""To me, I don't care how many spirit stones I have to spend on this phoenix boat. What I care about is that it carries my dream. My dream is to be like the phoenix and soar in the sky one day.""Senior Sister, I hope that there will be a beautiful figure accompanying me who will accompany me to see the scenery, pursue dreams, and share our worries."The source of the voice was none other than the good-for-nothing Zhao Zhongheng that the captain had mentioned.He stood on the golden phoenix boat with a young woman in a light purple Daoist robe beside him.This woman was in her twenties and had a moving appearance. From afar, she looked slender and elegant, and her purple clothes were like flowers.However, in the face of Zhao Zhongheng's words, her beautiful brows furrowed slightly and there was already impatience on her pretty face.At that moment, the sea breeze blew over, and her purple dress fluttered in the wind. She seemed to have noticed Xu Qing, who was on the magic boat in the distance.Under the sunlight, between the boats on both sides, a baleen whale broke through the water surface and soared into the air.A low cry that seemed to come from ancient times rang out from its mouth. It echoed like the sound of a flute, as though it would make everything ethereal.As it landed, water vapor drifted, blocking one's vision.In the woman's eyes, the sunlight seemed to have been separated into seven colors. The colorful beam of light showed a moment of beauty, reflecting on Xu Qing's Daoist robe and making it impossible to see his face.However, that charm left a deep impression on this woman.This lasted until their magic boats slowly left. Xu Qing stared at them for a long time. After confirming that they were indeed just passing by, he kept the dagger and continued cultivating.Time flowed by. Gradually, as the magic boat continued to move deeper, the eeriness and strangeness of the Forbidden Sea were also slowly reflected in Xu Qing's perception.He saw groups of rotting fish. They seemed to have retained their will when they were alive and turned into black pollution that spread under the magic boat.He also saw the terrifying figure of the megalodon. With incomparable savageness, it tore through its prey. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  Other than that, when Xu Qing passed by some areas, he could sense the deterrence from the bottom of the sea. It was as though it was spreading out at all times, lingering in those areas and permeating Xu Qing's heart, causing him to be even more vigilant.Even though he had read about this in the sea record and knew that this was the norm when going out to sea, his vigilance was still high.As for the anomalous substances, they were even denser on the Forbidden Sea. It was as though the entire sea was formed from anomalous substances. This caused Xu Qing's shadow to become even darker than before, as though it had turned into ink that flowed on its own...After noticing this scene, Xu Qing didn't hesitate. He directly circulated the suppression power of the purple crystal and suppressed it several times in a row. After that, he calmly stopped and felt slightly more at ease with regards to the shadow. Just like that, the sun was about to set. The first night on sea was about to arrive for Xu Qing.Perhaps it was because this sea area was very close to the Seven Blood Eyes, Xu Qing didn't encounter too many dangers during the day.Only at this moment, under the setting sun, did some aggressive swordfish appear on the surface of the sea. They leaped up in groups and transformed into arcs before falling into the sea again.Under the afterglow, their green bodies emitted a white glow, giving them a different kind of beauty.Perhaps it was because the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale was following the boat, most of these swordfish didn't get too close to Xu Qing. However, occasionally, a few of them would bump into the magic boat's protective barrier and bounce back into the sea with popping sounds.When the swordfishes crashed into the protective barrier, Xu Qing saw them even more clearly.These swordfish had ghastly sharp teeth and looked very sinister. Their eyes emitted a red glow and were filled with cruelty.Xu Qing waved his hand expressionlessly. Drops of water formed and seeped out of the protective barrier, turning into a buffer so that the swordfish wouldn't be killed by the collision.The sea records warned all the disciples who went out to sea that when sailing in the Forbidden Sea, it was best not to kill too many sea beasts unless necessary. This was because the more they killed, the more they would attract the attention of some strange existences in the Forbidden Sea.As for what kind of strange existence they were, the sea records didn't mention it. However, on the first night he went out to sea, Xu Qing didn't cultivate. All his attention was on the outside of the magic boat. Any movement made him incomparably vigilant.According to the sea record's description, the danger level of the sea at night was much more dangerous than during the day.On the sea, anything was possible.The sea record also mentioned that because the Forbidden Sea was vast, although danger lurked everywhere, it mostly depended on luck. Some people were unlucky and died in the sea on the first day. Some were lucky and were safe even after being out at sea for a few months.Xu Qing's luck wasn't bad. On the first night, other than the sound of the waves and the whimpering of the sea breeze, nothing strange happened.When dawn was about to arrive, he closed his eyes slightly and prepared to rest his mind. However, at this moment, an extremely intense palpitation suddenly rumbled in his mind like a volcano erupting.Xu Qing's body suddenly tensed up and his eyes abruptly opened. The magic boat's defense was instantly activated to the greatest extent.As he opened his eyes, the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale below the boat also opened its eyes.The dragonwhale's eyes were an extension of Xu Qing's senses. The instant it opened its eyes, there was nothing at the pitch-black bottom of the sea. However, there were faint sounds of grinding teeth.Krrkk, krrkkk, krkkk!As this sound echoed, the intense palpitations caused Xu Qing's breathing to become slightly hurried. It was the same as when he heard the singing voice in the forbidden zone's jungle back then. The chill seemed to have spread from the depths of the sea to the surface of the sea.This scene caused Xu Qing's expression to freeze and his entire body to tense up. He circulated his cultivation base and the magic boat instantly assumed a defensive posture.With the help of the dragonwhale's gaze, he saw a gigantic humanoid creature in the depths of the pitch-black seabed from afar.This creature's entire body was covered in tentacles that kept swaying. On his shoulder was a thick iron chain that extended into the distance. One could vaguely see a bronze dragon carriage at the end.This dragon carriage was dilapidated and covered in verdigris, filled with the traces of time. However, the tall carriage was exquisite and didn't lack majestic carvings, causing it to emit the aura of an emperor.At that moment, the giant pulled the bronze dragon carriage and strode away at the bottom of the sea. With every step he took, the sea would stir up and cause waves to spread.It was as though it was only passing through. Also, because the distance was too far, everything Xu Qing saw was very hazy. However, the feeling of palpitations and the sound of grinding teeth still clearly echoed in Xu Qing's mind even though he was so far away, causing his entire body to instinctively tremble. His pupils contracted and he was extremely vigilant.It was only when this huge humanoid creature slowly left that the trembling gradually weakened and the palpitations in his heart slowly disappeared."What was that?" Xu Qing abruptly lifted his head. His face was pale as he took a deep breath and walked out of the cabin. He stood at the bow of the ship and looked at the sea.In the gaze of the dragonwhale, the huge figure at the bottom of the sea had already left, leaving only a blurry outline.At this moment, the darkness before dawn gradually receded between sky and earth, and a hint of light slowly seeped out from the sky.It was like a lit torch that burned the pitch-black seawater, forming clouds that grew increasingly intense and continued to spread.In the end, the entire sky was burned and there was a red glow.This was the light of dawn.

Chapter 137 Fair Price
The light of dawn illuminated the sea. It also landed on Xu Qing's solemn figure.Xu Qing let out a long breath. That terrifying existence at the bottom of the sea had completely disappeared from his vision as dawn broke.Xu Qing didn't know what that giant was, let alone whose carriage it was. The sea record didn't mention it either. However, just now, he had only glanced at that giant from afar and he already felt an intense intimidation. One could imagine how terrifying this huge existence at the bottom of the sea must be.To be able to make such a powerful existence pull the carriage, Xu Qing couldn't imagine how mighty the owner of the dragon carriage was in the past.Fortunately, this giant didn't seem to have any ill intentions. Or rather, in the eyes of such existences, Xu Qing seemed to be of no significance."Forbidden Sea..." Xu Qing mumbled, his eyes revealing deep vigilance.He knew and personally felt that this Forbidden Sea was filled with endless dangers. In the following voyage, he became even more cautious and strictly followed the nautical chart, not deviating from his route at all.In the blink of an eye, several days passed.During these few days, Xu Qing didn't see anyone but he was getting more and more familiar with the Forbidden Sea. He encountered more sea beasts and also took action several times.Every time he attacked, he would obtain some biological materials. His Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale made a lot of contributions in this. Moreover, these fights allowed him to become more and more familiar with fighting on the sea.As for terrifying existences like the giant, Xu Qing did not encounter them again.The afternoon sun was scorching hot, and the sea breeze carried high temperatures. Xu Qing, who had ended his cultivation, opened his eyes and looked into the distance through the protective barrier, frowning slightly.His destination was the direction of the Western Reef Archipelago, and Sea Lizard Island was just behind the archipelago. According to the nautical chart, he still needed seven days to reach it.As for the area he was currently in, according to the nautical chart, it was a relatively safe route to the Western Reef Archipelago. However, as he got closer, Xu Qing felt a little puzzled.In the sea area in front of him, there were a large number of vines that extended out of the surface of the sea. There were more vines further inside the area. At the end, there seemed to be some boats trapped.However, the distance was too far, so he couldn't see it clearly.As for the edge of this sea area, there were relatively fewer vines.It was as though something had attracted it to extend out from the bottom of the sea earlier. At this moment, it was slowly shrinking, as though it wouldn't be long before it sank again.However, the arrival of Xu Qing's boat caused these slowly sinking vines to find a new target. They rapidly approached Xu Qing's boat at a speed visible to the naked eye.Xu Qing's vigilance increased. He stood at the bow of the boat and performed a series of hand seals with both hands. He then controlled the magic boat to retreat, trying to avoid the approaching vines.However, the speed of the vines was very fast. Although Xu Qing didn't go deep into the sea area, nor did he waste time retreating immediately, there were still a few vines that got close and entangled the boat.These vines were pitch-black in color and as thick as an arm. They looked very sinister with their sharp spikes. The most astonishing thing was that these sharp spikes contained some kind of suction force. As they coiled around the boat, the consumption of the magic boat instantly increased.Fortunately, there weren't many vines and these little numbers couldn't affect the speed of the magic boat. However, Xu Qing could still clearly sense that this consumption was to some extent similar to spirit energy being sucked away.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. With a wave of his right hand, a dagger appeared and he instantly leaped up. A cold light flashed and the vines were cut one after another. Coupled with the power of the magic boat, he gradually left this area.After he was far away, Xu Qing looked at the distant sea area. He then lowered his head and his gaze landed on the planks.There were a few vines that he had cut off there that were twisting like sea snakes. Green, extremely acidic, liquid flowed out of the cuts and emitted sizzling sounds as drops of them fell on the plank.Xu Qing's expression turned somewhat unsightly. When he had cut the vines earlier, he had felt that the vines were extremely tenacious. Even with his physical strength, he still needed to use his full strength.After pondering for a moment, he formed a seal. Immediately, the array formation under his feet shone, revealing the core of the spirit gathering array.Xu Qing swept his gaze over and discovered that three of the spirit stones on it showed signs of dimming, as though they had been sucked dry."As expected, it absorbs spirit energy." Xu Qing's heart ached a little.There were over a hundred records of vines in the sea record, and most of them looked similar, so it was very difficult for Xu Qing to accurately judge them immediately.This was especially so in this sea area. Regardless of whether it was the sect's nautical chart or the nautical chart he had obtained from the merfolk youth, there were no vines labeled."If there were not any before, it should be a vine that can move on its own and it also likes spirit energy, and there is only the spirit devouring vine that fits the bill." Xu Qing recalled the content in the sea record and frowned."The spirit devouring vine loves spirit energy. It can't be damaged by spells and can only be broken by brute force. It can devour the power of magic boats and the spirits of cultivators. If they are entangled, they will die an extremely miserable death. This thing is sensitive to anomalous substances and wanders the Forbidden Sea. Its location is often a place with relatively few anomalous substances."Xu Qing fell silent and lifted his head to look into the distance.This was the shortest route to the Western Reef Archipelago. If he took a detour, the time he would need to spend would increase by a lot.This was especially so since he didn't know the exact range of these vines. According to the sea record's description, these spirit-devouring vines would often drift in groups and their range was extremely vast."It will take too long if I detour. It's not like I can't neutralize this spirit devouring vine."Xu Qing thought about it and narrowed his eyes. He touched his storage bag and a black-colored pill appeared in his hand.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  This pill was none other than the black pill that contained dense anomalous substances.With the black pill in hand, Xu Qing stood at the bow of the ship and controlled the magic boat to move closer to the vine area.Very soon, the surface of the sea churned and a large number of vines broke out of the sea. They greedily rushed toward Xu Qing's magic boat. However, the instant they got close, Xu Qing calmly threw the black pill to the surface of the sea in front of him. As the black pill fell into the sea and dissolved, the anomalous substances suddenly became denser.In an instant, the vines that were spreading over in the surroundings all trembled in unison, as though they had encountered something they hated the most. They instantly retreated and distanced themselves, allowing Xu Qing's magic boat to move unhindered.Xu Qing's expression relaxed slightly as he controlled the magic boat to move at full speed. Although the area was filled with vines, as he threw out black pills one after another, all the vines that were about to near him revealed intense rejection and moved away one after another. Just like that, Xu Qing's magic boat continued forward. As he threw more black pills, the surroundings of the boat were filled with dense anomalous substances. Gradually, there was no need for him to continue throwing black pills. The vines in the surroundings would instinctively retreat.Xu Qing's magic boat got closer and closer to the boats that were trapped by the vines in the distance. The sea breeze also transmitted some human voices.Although it was faint, cultivators could still hear it clearly."Zhao Zhongheng, what kind of path did you lead us to!!""Senior Sister Ding, please calm down... There were no vines in this area previously. They must have migrated here in the past few days. There's nothing I can do about it. However, I've already asked my grandfather for help. I believe someone will come and help us escape soon..."The person who spoke was none other than Zhao Zhongheng. At this moment, his phoenix boat was completely trapped here. With a large number of vines entangling it, the boat could only move forward with difficulty.His followers' boats were also trapped in the surroundings. All of them had anxious expressions but they had no choice but to do their best to continuously cut the vines.Zhao Zhongheng was also vexed. The vines in this area had truly exceeded his expectations. At this moment, he was trying his best to control the phoenix boat to break out of here. Facing the dissatisfied expression of his senior sister beside him, he could only apologize. On one hand, he was pursuing the other party. On the other hand, it was also because this Senior Sister Ding's background was extraordinary.He hurriedly took out a jade box and handed it over."Senior Sister Ding, don't be angry. Believe me, there's no problem. I'll definitely bring you to the Western Reef Archipelago. This clarity pill is a rare medicine that can nourish the soul. My grandfather gave it to me. I'll give it to you as an apology gift."The beautiful woman in the light purple Daoist robe at the side seemed to have lost most of her patience. She frowned and looked at the jade box in Zhao Zhongheng's hand. After taking it, she forced herself to calm down and was about to speak.However, at that moment, the whistling sound of a magic boat came from afar. She instinctively looked over and saw a magic boat in the distance. It was riding the wind and breaking the waves as it sped over.There was a person standing straight on the magic boat like a pine tree. His gray Daoist robe fluttered in the wind, and the sunlight streamed through his long hair, forming a colorful halo.Under the halo was a cold face that was enough to make the hearts of the opposite sex race. It was so flawless that even the vines seemed to be moved by it. It was as though his handsome face turned them into a mimosa as they automatically retreated around him.This scene caused the woman's eyes to flicker. A sweet smile appeared on her face as she called out to Xu Qing."Junior Brother, what method did you use to make the vines retreat? Can you help me?"Her smile was sweet and her voice was sweet. She seemed to have transformed into a sweet lady, causing Zhao Zhongheng, who was also looking at Xu Qing, to feel very uncomfortable.He had shown a lot of interest and care countless times on the way but he had never seen the other party smile or speak like this...This discomfort caused Zhao Zhongheng to be unhappy. There was some hostility in his heart as he looked at Xu Qing.At a glance, he felt that the face was a little familiar and immediately recognized it."It's you!" Zhao Zhongheng recognized Xu Qing. If it was anyone else, he might have forgotten about it long ago. However, very few people would forget Xu Qing's face after seeing it.Now that he recognized Xu Qing, Zhao Zhongheng immediately sensed the spirit energy fluctuations on the other party's body. It seemed to be much stronger than the last time he met him. However, to him, as a core disciple, his status was noble enough for him to ignore the vast majority of piedmont disciples.After a cold glance, Zhao Zhongheng calmly spoke."Come here and use your method to open a path for us."He would usually be bossy to the gray-robed piedmont disciples and it was the same now. From what he knew, when the gray-robed piedmont disciples saw him, they would fear and obey him.Xu Qing had noticed the phoenix boat earlier and also saw the two core disciples in light purple Daoist robes on it. However, he didn't bother with them and his magic boat whistled past them without any change in speed."Hm? Are you deaf? Can't you hear me?!" Zhao Zhongheng's expression was gloomy. With a wave of his hand, a large number of water droplets appeared in front of him, forming a water sword that headed straight for Xu Qing's magic boat.However, the instant it got close, a water curtain appeared out of thin air and blocked it.With a boom, the water sword collapsed.The magic boat under Xu Qing suddenly stopped. He turned around and coldly looked at Zhao Zhongheng. In the distance, the waves of the sea churned and the surface of the sea suddenly exploded. A huge Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale leaped up from within, revealing half of its body in the air. Under the sunlight, it was extremely dazzling.It let out a heart-shaking roar and heavily slammed into the sea, sinking again. However, its violent aura spread out.This scene instantly caused Zhao Zhongheng's expression to change drastically. The eyes of the followers beside him also widened, and huge waves rose in their hearts. Even that senior sister's expression changed."Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale!"Zhao Zhongheng took a deep breath. When he looked at Xu Qing, his expression was filled with disbelief. Although he was a core disciple and had a crushing advantage over the piedmont disciples in terms of status... this wasn't absolute.Among the piedmont disciples, if they could cultivate the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale at the eighth level of the Sea Transformation Art, it meant that their aptitude was astonishing and they had a high chance of advancing to Foundation Building in the future.Even the core disciples didn't want to provoke such a person. They would often try to befriend him. After all, once he advanced to the Foundation Building realm, his status would immediately rise. Even they would have to respectfully greet him.Xu Qing coldly looked at Zhao Zhongheng whose expression had changed and slowly spoke."20 spirit stones for a boat. As for your boat, it will be 100 spirit stones."

Chapter 138 A Hundred Sounds Become Yin (1)
Xu Qing had done this many times in the scavenger campsite. Although he had asked for an exaggerated amount this time, he didn't think that it was anything wrong. Helping wasn't a responsibility in the first place, so he naturally needed to be paid. If the other party's attitude wasn't good, it was reasonable for him to increase the price.As soon as he spoke, Senior Sister Ding fell into deep thought. As for Zhao Zhongheng, his expression was gloomy. He wanted to say something but didn't.If it was in the past, he would definitely mock him. However, he was a little hesitant now.Xu Qing swept his gaze across these people and saw that they didn't seem to have any intention of paying. He didn't say anything else and was about to control the magic boat to leave. At that moment, Senior Sister Ding looked at the side of Xu Qing's face and suddenly spoke."No problem!"As she spoke, she waved her hand and took out her magic boat, landing on the surface of the sea. She then leaped onto the magic boat and controlled it to get closer to Xu Qing.Zhao Zhongheng was stunned and immediately became a little anxious."Senior Sister, you…"Senior Sister Ding didn't even turn her head. It was as though she didn't even see Zhao Zhongheng. Her magic boat was like a willow leaf. It was very beautiful but at the same time, it was filled with liveliness. As she got closer, the vines in the surroundings instantly twined over. It was obvious that she was in danger.Xu Qing waved his hand and a black pill instantly landed in front of Senior Sister Ding's magic boat. As it landed, the vines immediately retreated, allowing her magic boat to pass successfully. After she neared Xu Qing's boat, she hurriedly put away her magic boat and leaped onto Xu Qing's boat.Due to the existence of the protective barrier, she stood on it unsteadily.Xu Qing frowned and looked at Senior Sister Ding."Thank you for helping me, Junior Brother. My name is Ding Xue. I should be older than you, so you can call me Senior Sister. My magic boat isn't good at sailing here. I'll give you another 20 spirit stones. I'll stay with you for the time being in this area."Senior Sister Ding could faintly sense Xu Qing's personality. She smiled sweetly and directly took out a spirit ticket from the Sixth Peak worth 40 spirit stones. Outside the protective barrier, she gestured to Xu Qing.Xu Qing swept his gaze across the spirit ticket and observed Senior Sister Ding's cultivation base. Only after his gaze swept past her neck did he open a gap in the barrier, allowing Senior Sister Ding to land on the deck. After that, he lifted his hand and grabbed the air to take the spirit ticket for inspection.After confirming that it was real, he didn't say anything else. He carefully placed the spirit ticket into his pocket and controlled the magic boat to move. He wasn't afraid that the other party had ill intentions on his magic boat. The moment the other party arrived, she was already struck by his poison.However, this poison required him to mix other poisons before it could erupt.Under the light of the setting sun, Xu Qing looked exceptionally handsome. At the side, Senior Sister Ding had a graceful figure and a sweet smile. Her beautiful hair fluttered in the sea breeze and her brows carried a moving charm. This expression was something she didn't have when she was with Zhao Zhongheng previously.As the sea breeze blew over, Senior Sister Ding's gentle voice could be heard."Junior Brother, how should I address you?""Junior Brother, this magic boat of yours is very special. I've never seen such a boat before.""Junior Brother, which department are you from?" Seeing this scene, Zhao Zhongheng became anxious. The senior sister he had painstakingly invited had boarded someone else's boat. This made him extremely anxious and annoyed. He gritted his teeth and took out a red talisman.This was a runic treasure.Looking at Xu Qing and Senior Sister Ding who were about to leave, Zhao Zhongheng endured his heartache and directly blasted the talisman into the sea. Immediately, the talisman burned, forming a shocking air wave that spread in all directions.The vines around the Phoenix were instantly enveloped. Most of them instantly shattered into pieces, and the remaining ones rapidly contracted.Using this opportunity to retreat, Zhao Zhongheng shouted."Senior Sister, wait for me."As he spoke, he used all his strength to control the Phoenix. He didn't care about its expenditure as he made it erupt with speed and rushed out. His followers behind him hurriedly shouted for help."You guys wait here. I have already informed grandfather. The sect will send someone to save you soon." Zhao Zhongheng didn't have the time to care about them and quickly moved forward.However, there were too many vines in this area and very soon, his ship was entangled again. In his anxiety, Zhao Zhongheng endured his heartache and continued to bombard the sea with the talisman.Just like that, he chased all the way and gradually broke through the vines, closing the distance between him and Xu Qing.The rumbling behind her finally diverted Senior Sister Ding's attention from Xu Qing. She frowned and looked behind her. She immediately saw the Phoenix and Zhao Zhongheng.Looking at the other party's runic treasure bombardment, Senior Sister Ding glared and sneered."Zhao Zhongheng, I originally didn't want to follow you. You were the one who took the initiative to send me to the Western Reef Archipelago. I said that we shouldn't take this path but you insisted on putting on a brave front. It's fine if we were trapped here. Although I'm anxious to reach my destination, I can understand your helplessness. However, you actually had a way to escape but you didn't use it!"Zhao Zhongheng felt bitter. At this moment, his posture when he had started this journey was long gone. He hurriedly explained."Senior Sister, you've misunderstood me. This… this is something my grandfather gave me to save my life. There aren't many uses left…"Senior Sister Ding snorted coldly and turned her head, ignoring him.Zhao Zhongheng became even more anxious and didn't dare to blame Senior Sister Ding. Hence, he put the blame on Xu Qing. The more he looked at Xu Qing's magic boat, the more he disliked it.However, the other party was clearly very strong, so he had no choice but to suppress his anger and use the talisman a few more times. After the talisman collapsed and dissipated, he finally broke free and caught up to Xu Qing's magic boat."Senior Sister, come back. I know I was wrong…"  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 ,m Senior Sister Ding didn't seem to hear him. She smiled sweetly and looked at the side of Xu Qing's face as she spoke softly."Junior Brother, are you hungry? I have some snacks here." As she spoke, Senior Sister Ding took out a small box from her storage bag.

Chapter 139 A Hundred Sounds Become Yin (2)
Xu Qing shook his head and expressionlessly looked at Senior Sister Ding."Senior Sister Ding, we've left the vine area. Please get off the boat." Hearing Xu Qing's words, Zhao Zhongheng was instantly excited. He thought to himself that this kid was still tactful, and looked at Senior Sister Ding expectantly."Junior Brother, which direction are you going in? Maybe it's on the way," Senior Sister Ding said with a sweet smile.Zhao Zhongheng's expression turned ugly.Xu Qing frowned.Seeing Xu Qing frown, Senior Sister Ding's bright eyes moved slightly. After some thought, she spoke."Junior Brother, the place I'm going to is the Western Reef Archipelago. It's only a five-day sea journey from here. If it's not on the way, I'll leave now. If it's on the way, I'm willing to pay another 200 spirit stones as a fee. Junior Brother, what do you think?"As Senior Sister Ding spoke, she took out two spirit tickets and stared at Xu Qing with her beautiful eyes.Xu Qing looked at the spirit tickets and was extremely tempted.He didn't expect that it would be so easy to earn spirit stones after going out to sea.The Sea Lizard Island he was going to was located in the depths of the Western Reef Archipelago, so it naturally was on the way. If the other party wanted to ride for free, he would definitely not agree. However, if she were to give 200 spirit stones…After Xu Qing thought about it, he felt that it was very reasonable.200 spirit stones might seem astonishing, but after all, she had boarded his boat. According to the sect's tradition, he had the responsibility of protecting her. It could be considered a temporary mission.Moreover, the sea was so dangerous and the mission was a little urgent. Hence, it was normal for her to give more spirit stones. At the thought of this, Xu Qing nodded.The smile on Senior Sister Ding's face became even sweeter as she placed the spirit tickets in Xu Qing's hand. As for Zhao Zhongheng, his expression turned from ugly to bitter. When he looked at Xu Qing, even though he knew that the other party wasn't ordinary, he still couldn't control the anger in his eyes.Xu Qing directly ignored Zhao Zhongheng's gaze and controlled the magic boat to move forward rapidly.He was in a good mood. He thought about how he could earn 200 spirit stones by just taking someone along with him. He felt that this was very worth it. The only thing that made him feel a little uncomfortable was that Senior Sister Ding had a lot to say. She seemed to have endless questions to ask, and most of them were related to him.Also, her gaze was always fixed on his face. This made Xu Qing very annoyed and he just kept silent.However, the more silent he was, the more enthusiastic Senior Sister Ding became. This caused Xu Qing to involuntarily speed up the magic boat, wanting to complete this journey as soon as possible.As for Zhao Zhongheng, his mentality was about to explode on the way. The flames in his eyes fused with the fire in his heart and seemed to have materialized. This was especially so when he thought about how much effort he had put in this time. In fact, his grandfather had even stepped forward to communicate with the other party's elders before he obtained this chance to be alone with her and perform. He didn't expect… that his plan would actually be hijacked by a piedmont disciple.He was going crazy and his entire body trembled. His countless grievances seemed like they could erupt out of his chest at any moment."This b*tch, she didn't even come to my boat for free and insisted on spending money to board that gigolo's boat. She clearly has her eyes on him. Is she blind? I, Zhao Zhongheng, am countless times stronger than that kid!""In terms of spirit stones, my net worth is countless. In terms of status, I'm a core disciple. In terms of background, my grandfather is an elder of the Seventh Peak. How can this kid compare to me? He can't even compare to a single strand of hair on me!!""What does he have? Other than the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale, he's useless in everything else. He's just a pauper at the foot of the mountain. Isn't he just handsome? Can beauty be eaten!!"As Zhao Zhongheng's jealousy rose and fell intensely, the sun set and dusk passed.The sea in the evening was even more mysterious. The setting sun was still burning, illuminating the undulating waves and dyeing them red. It was as though flames were spreading, flickering and rolling, each wave higher than the last.This lasted until the fire in the sky slowly extinguished and the flames of the sea gradually dimmed. The world then turned pitch-black.From afar, the dim surface of the sea was covered in layers of scales, and the sea breeze was also a little lighter. It was as though the entire world was gradually calming down.It was not possible to sail at night. The degree of danger was much greater than during the day. Hence, Xu Qing chose to anchor the boat. Senior Sister Ding, who was at the side, sat beside Xu Qing and took out food. Her smile was still sweet as she passed it to Xu Qing.Xu Qing didn't eat. After thanking her, he returned to the cabin and activated the inner protective barrier to enter seclusion."Junior Brother, are you going to cultivate? I'll guard you." Senior Sister Ding didn't mind Xu Qing's coldness at all. After she smiled and spoke, she really sat cross-legged outside the cabin.This scene caused Zhao Zhongheng, who was on the Phoenix, to go crazy again. However, looking at Senior Sister Ding's beautiful face, he still endured it and said from the Phoenix."Senior Sister, I have some sea fish here. We…""Not interested," Senior Sister Ding said calmly. "Senior Sister, I…""There's no need." Best novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "I…""Please be quiet. Don't disturb Junior Brother's cultivation." Senior Sister Ding lifted her head and glanced at Zhao Zhongheng impatiently.Zhao Zhongheng's face darkened. He gritted his teeth and stared fixedly at the cabin where Xu Qing was cultivating. He was going crazy to the extreme in his heart but he was helpless. He could only meditate to calm his anger.Just like that, time slowly passed and very soon, it was late at night.While Xu Qing and the other two were meditating, under the night sky, an abnormal change slowly occurred in the deep seawater that no one noticed.In the sea, specks of starlight gathered and gradually transformed into wisps of shadows that slowly floated to the surface of the sea… These shadows seemed to be the mysterious and deep dreams that the black Forbidden Sea weaved for the travelers.However, as the shadows rose into the air, they continuously transformed into all kinds of sinister appearances, transforming into malicious ghosts, drowned humans, and rotting beasts. At the next instant, their original silence turned mournful. Waves of sharp cries that shook the soul tore through the air and spread in all directions.These sounds were abnormally tragic and frightening.Immediately, the dream… became a nightmare!Xu Qing and the other two instantly opened their eyes. Zhao Zhongheng's pupils contracted, and Senior Sister Ding's expression was solemn. Her right hand was placed on her storage bag.Xu Qing walked out of the cabin and his gaze froze.As far as the eye could see, countless evil ghosts rose into the air and flew crazily toward the end of the pitch-black sky as though they had been summoned.They formed a group, then a crowd.It was sinister and paranormal.This was… the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.Xu Qing lifted his head and stared at everything. He watched as the malicious ghosts rose into the air while emitting sharp cries. In his mind, the description of the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts appeared."There are wonders in the Endless Sea that mortals haven't heard of. With the Golden Crow Chi Yang as a companion, a hundred sounds form a tune - Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon.""God was delighted. When He closed his eyes and looked, the Endless Sea became Forbidden. The hundred sounds became <anno data-annotation-id="28b0449f-1dcc-4b06-8f1f-703143658945">Yin</anno>.""If my sect's disciples encounter them, don't move, don't touch, don't disturb…"The words on the sea record mentioned a story.The story told all the Seven Blood Eyes disciples who were going out to sea that this sea that surrounded the Nanhuang Continent was originally called the Endless Sea.In the past, before the fragmented face of the god appeared in the sky, there would occasionally be strange music echoing in the Endless Sea. This music was extraordinary. Ordinary people wouldn't be able to hear it even if they went out to sea.Only cultivators could hear a thing or two amidst the drifting music on the sea.The story also introduced the origins of this piece of music.The sun in the sky wasn't a star but a huge Golden Crow Divine Bird. Its name was Chi Yang. Every morning, it would fly out of its bedroom in the depths of the Endless Sea and return at night. This cycle repeated endlessly as though it had a mission.Every time it returned to its bedroom at night, musicians would play a tune for it. This tune contained a hundred notes, forming a dreamy meaning. As for the name of the musical piece, it was called Heavenly Voice Welcomes the Moon.Every time the tune rang out, the bright moon would rise into the air and patrol the world on behalf of Chi Yang.Until one day when the god's fragmented face arrived. He, who was floating outside the sky of the world, was very happy when he heard this tune. He narrowed his eyes and looked over.The instant his gaze landed, the Endless Sea boiled. The density of anomalous substances exceeded imagination, causing the Endless Sea to become a Forbidden Sea filled with dense anomalous substances.As for the hundred notes that formed the tune, they were also invaded. The sounds turned into yin, and as if they had died, they turned into ghosts.The Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="28b0449f-1dcc-4b06-8f1f-703143658945">阴 can mean a lot of things.

Chapter 140 Deep Sea Dragon Shadow (1)
The story told all the Seven Blood Eyes disciples that once they went out to sea and encountered this strange scene, they shouldn't move, touch it, or disturb it.Xu Qing remained silent.As the contents of the record in the Sea Records Library appeared in his mind, he sat cross-legged on the magic boat and looked up at the countless ferocious ghosts in the surroundings. They let out waves of ear-piercing roars and rose into the air in huge groups."The main point mentioned in the record isn't the story itself."Xu Qing looked at the sky and mumbled inwardly amidst the coldness of the surroundings."It's just that… its description of everything uses the word 'story', not 'legend'.""Compared to legends, the term 'story' often represents a scene that really happened." Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and stared at his surroundings.Countless malicious ghosts filled the sky and sea, and their voices became increasingly mournful. This scene was enough to intimidate the timid and make them shiver in horror.However, to Xu Qing, he was used to it.He had seen the eyes of the god before. He had lived in a dead city filled with ferocious beasts and strange things for more than half a month. He had also seen too much life and death in the slums that were shrouded in the darkness of human nature since he was young.After experiencing tempering and baptism in the jungle of the forbidden zone and the Seven Blood Eyes, to him, these strange things weren't the only things that killed people. Anything in this world could kill.Such a scene might cause others to feel fear but to Xu Qing, it was not significant.Due to his calm state, Xu Qing could faintly hear the lingering sounds of music amidst the cries of these malicious ghosts rising into the air.Xu Qing closed his eyes and didn't move at all, as though he was trying to listen to the music.From afar, regardless of whether it was him or this magic boat, they were insignificant in the sea. As the boat swayed, they were gradually covered by the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts.Only the lingering sound beside Xu Qing's ear became clearer and clearer…Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts, Night Dance of a Hundred Ghosts, Night Song of a Hundred Ghosts.Time slowly passed under Zhao Zhongheng's nervousness, Xu Qing's concentrated listening, and Senior Sister Ding's curiosity toward Xu Qing's state.As morning arrived and the night music dissipated, Xu Qing opened his eyes. There were still faint echoes of the music lingering in his mind.Senior Sister Ding's beautiful eyes landed on Xu Qing and she couldn't help but ask."Junior Brother Xu, were you listening the entire night? Did you hear anything?"Xu Qing didn't bother. He didn't want to be disturbed at this moment. He continued to immerse himself in the lingering sound in his mind without even blinking his eyes.This made Senior Sister Ding even more curious. She looked at Xu Qing and patted her storage bag with her right hand. She immediately took out a jade box and handed it over. "Junior Brother Xu, there's a clarity pill in here. It has a very good effect of nourishing the soul. I'll give it to you. Can you tell me the answer?" On the Phoenix, Zhao Zhongheng's eyes instantly widened and his breathing became hurried. The flames in his eyes almost couldn't be suppressed. This pill was a gift he had given Senior Sister Ding when he saw her impatient expression earlier…Now, Xu Qing wasn't happy and Senior Sister Ding was giving him the same gift…This scene caused him to go completely crazy."Clarity pill?"Xu Qing's attention was instinctively attracted. He knew about the clarity pill and also knew that the value of this rare pill wasn't small.Hence, he was a little surprised. He took the jade box and opened it. After taking a look and confirming that there were no problems, he placed it in his pocket.Seeing that Xu Qing had accepted it, Senior Sister Ding was very happy. She smiled at Xu Qing."Junior Brother Xu, tell me. I know that the sea record mentioned the Night Song of a Hundred Ghosts. Only those with sharp senses can hear it."Xu Qing nodded as a hint of reminiscence appeared in his eyes."I heard the sound of teacher guiding me when he taught me about herbs and medicine."  novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "Junior Brother Xu, you actually know the Dao of plants. How impressive." Senior Sister Ding's face was filled with admiration. As for Zhao Zhongheng, who was on the Phoenix, his face revealed disdain. He curled his lips and said in a low voice."Who doesn't know how to brag!"Senior Sister Ding didn't bother with the jealous Zhao Zhongheng. She eagerly asked Xu Qing about the Dao of plants.On account of the clarity pill, although Xu Qing felt a little impatient, he still forced himself to reply.On the way, Zhao Zhongheng was clearly even more anxious. In order to pull his senior sister back to his side, he began to curry favor and frequently gave her gifts.However, Senior Sister Ding mostly rejected him coldly. Occasionally, when she really had no choice, she would reluctantly accept the gifts. However, she didn't have the slightest intention of changing boats. Instead, on Xu Qing's boat, bell-like laughter would often ring out. This caused Zhao Zhongheng's internal organs to be burned by anger.This was especially so for the next few days on the road. Senior Sister Ding's laughter could be heard even more than when she was with him for a year. Many times, he even saw that it was Senior Sister Ding who took the initiative to find a topic to talk about with Xu Qing, asking about plants and medicinal herbs. However, Zhao Zhongheng clearly knew that Ding Xue usually didn't have the slightest interest in herbs.If Xu Qing didn't speak, she would give him gifts as consultation fees. Those gifts were all from him.This scene caused Zhao Zhongheng to be in a daze many times. Vaguely, he felt that everything was so familiar. He and Senior Sister Ding seemed… somewhat similar.This discovery caused Zhao Zhongheng to feel sorrow from the bottom of his heart. However, he was unwilling to give up. He could only force himself to be in good spirits and try his best to keep up.In fact, in order to attract Senior Sister Ding's attention, Zhao Zhongheng simply erupted with his cultivation along the way and kept capturing all kinds of sea beasts to invite her to taste them. This method indeed had some effect, and this made Zhao Zhongheng's heart come alive again.
