"Uh…"The Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race who was about to arrive suddenly paused.He was a nonhuman when he was alive. His appearance looked like a human but had six eyes. Other than the two on normal locations, he had one on his glabella, two on his cheeks, as well as one on the back of his head.More than half of its body had already taken shape in the teleportation array, and it showed his head and eyes.His breathing was clearly hurried. Regardless of whether it was the five eyes that Xu Qing could see or the sixth eye that he couldn't see, all of their pupils constricted.All the eyes showed shock and disbelief. The intense changes in his mind couldn't be concealed at all."Yo-your life fire? Not a ball!! Thi-this…"This Mystic Brilliance Form Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race only felt a rumbling in his mind and his body shivered. The intense life-and-death crisis caused his soul to tremble, and he wanted nothing more than to destroy the teleportation array. However, the teleportation was almost finished, so he couldn't do it while in the teleportation array. He quickly shouted at the black-robed scholar."Hurry up and destroy the teleportation array!" In reality, he wasn't the only shocked one. The black-robed scholar from the Sea Corpse Race, who was about to approach Xu Qing, also felt his mind churning at this moment.The heat and light of the flames in Xu Qing's body at this moment was too terrifying!That volcanic eruption-like might caused the black-robed scholar's eyes to feel as though they were being pierced by countless needles. The intense pain was incomparable, and he couldn't look straight at Xu Qing. The shock he felt was so great that his mind was about to collapse.How could the black-robed scholar dare to approach? An intense life-and-death crisis subverted everything in his mind. There was only one path in front of him.That was to violate the race's instincts and not listen to the words of the higher-ups. He would make use of their arrival to attract the enemy's attention and escape rapidly.He instantly made a judgment and retreated.At that moment, Xu Qing, who was standing in the distance, lifted his head.The volcano in his body shook the heavens and the earth, burning the seawater in the surroundings. Even his eyes emitted piercing flames like a divine son.His gaze seemed to be able to penetrate all barriers and obstacles. Even the fluctuations of the teleportation array couldn't affect it at all. Xu Qing directly locked onto the six-eyed cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race.In Xu Qing's eyes, everything was extremely slow.The black-robed scholar was slowly fleeing. The dust in the surroundings seemed to have stopped, and everything seemed to be fixed eternally.The fluctuations of the teleportation array were like ink in the water, slowly spreading. Only the six-eyed cultivator moved relatively faster.However… it was still very slow! Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  Being stared at by Xu Qing shook the mind of the six-eyed cultivator. His expression changed drastically and he couldn't help but wail inwardly."Two balls, it is definitely two balls. Since this Seventh Peak cultivator of the Seven Blood Eyes has two balls of life fire, why didn't he let me out earlier!!" As he wailed inwardly, the teleportation array suddenly showed signs of destruction.Clearly, on the other side of the teleportation array, someone was helping him destroy the teleportation array and avoid this calamity.However, it was too late.Xu Qing lifted his right hand and gently pressed toward the teleportation array.A ball of black fiendish fire erupted from the volcano in Xu Qing's body and spread out crazily. It instantly formed a huge black flame palm that descended toward the teleportation array.This palm emitted an astonishing heat that carried an aura that could burn everything. As it landed, cracks appeared on the ground, as though the ground was about to shatter.All the seaweed withered and turned into ashes. The seawater in the surrounding area also evaporated in an instant, forming a hollow space, revealing the dimming teleportation array.It also revealed the six-eyed cultivator whose mind had collapsed and was letting out hysterical roars in the teleportation array.He didn't have time to escape. The incomparably intense life-and-death crisis caused him to let out a mournful roar. He used all his strength and four additional arms grew out of his body.He raised all six hands and the life fire in his body erupted to activate the Mystic Brilliance Form. At this moment, he didn't hesitate to destroy his magic apertures and stimulate all his potential, turning his body into a ball of flames that resisted Xu Qing's black fire palm.At the same time, he also took out three magic artifacts and spat out a blue jade. Amidst his despair were malevolence and madness.However, it was still not enough!A ball of life fire wasn't worthy of being an enemy of a cultivator with a life lantern.As the black fire palm landed and everything in the surroundings turned to ashes, the six-eyed cultivator's magic artifacts were of no use. Two of them instantly cracked and collapsed. The third one also collapsed in less than half a breath of time. The last to shatter was the blue jade. It shattered with cracking sounds. After that, the powerful body of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator started collapsing.In the blink of an eye, three of his six arms collapsed. Amidst the bloody mess, his legs couldn't withstand it and exploded.The remaining three arms were all twisted from the huge impact. In the end, they couldn't resist and exploded into blue blood mist.The black palm ruthlessly slapped down on the ground, crushing everything below!The teleportation array shattered and turned into ashes.A deep palm print appeared on the ground, and the six-eyed cultivator's body was completely destroyed. Only a ball of green fire was left. The dim ball of green fire that looked like it could be extinguished at any time fled crazily into the distance.Its speed was extremely fast in the eyes of those who hadn't formed their life fire. In fact, they wouldn't even be able to see it clearly. However, in Xu Qing's eyes, it was still very slow.He took a step forward.With this step, the surrounding seawater exploded, transforming into torrents that rolled crazily to the sides.His speed was so fast that he broke through all obstacles in the blink of an eye and appeared in front of the shocked six-eyed cultivator. He then casually grabbed it.He ignored the other party's life fire and directly penetrated it, grabbing the soul inside like he was grabbing a chick.No matter how the other party struggled, it was useless. In the end, amidst the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's mournful cries, black flames covered Xu Qing's body and instantly enveloped him.He directly refined his soul!Even now, the dead six-eyed cultivator couldn't understand why this Seven Blood Eyes disciple was clearly so strong but still interrupted his teleportation several times.After all, he had never seen someone who could reach such a level after just forming their life fire. Hence, from what he knew, it was impossible for Xu Qing to have just formed his life fire.In the span of three breaths, as Xu Qing released his grip, the soul of the Sea Corpse Race cultivator was refined into his body and burned like firewood.Xu Qing then turned toward the black-robed scholar who looked to be fleeing slowly in his eyes. Looking at the other party's fleeing figure, Xu Qing even had the time to think about the difference between having life fire and not having one."The difference is indeed too great." Xu Qing sighed with emotion and took a step toward the black-robed scholar.The speed of the Mystic Brilliance Form caused the black-robed scholar to be unable to see him clearly at all. As the seawater exploded again, Xu Qing had already appeared in front of him.Before the black-robed scholar's movements could change, Xu Qing had already lifted his hand. A black-flame dagger appeared and slashed across the black-robed scholar's neck.The head and the body that were separated into two were connected by the black flames.As the flames spread up and down, they split into two again and were burned at the same time. After they turned into ashes and dissipated, Xu Qing looked in the direction the youth from the Third Peak had fled in earlier.The other party's figure could no longer be seen. Clearly, he had fled far away and it was impossible for him to know the changes here.Xu Qing thought about it and gave up on pursuing.Other than escaping, the other party could also release bizarre entities. Although the latter made him a target and escaped, he still helped him a little in the end.Xu Qing started collecting the spoils of war. He then checked his surroundings and confirmed that he had indeed not missed anything. Only then did he leave, instantly disappearing from this place.Under the Mystic Brilliance Form, Xu Qing, who was speeding through the underwater world, felt exhilarated. He had an indescribable feeling. That strength that came from his body made Xu Qing feel very safe.His speed was so fast that ordinary Foundation Building cultivators couldn't see him at all. At the same time, the feeling of a volcano erupting in his body shocked even him.'I wonder how I am now compared to the captain…' Xu Qing mumbled inwardly. As he sensed the rising life fire on his life lantern, he deeply realized how terrifying the Mystic Brilliance Form was."All my abilities seem to have transformed!" As Xu Qing sped, he lifted his right hand and waved it. Immediately, a black sea of fire that was much more majestic than before spread out, instantly destroying a teleportation array of the Sea Corpse Race.After that, he clenched his fist and pressed it against the ground. Immediately, the ground rumbled and cracks erupted, forming a huge pit.He performed a series of hand seals. The seawater in the surroundings suddenly churned and gushed toward the deep pit with a thought. After it was filled up, it formed a storm-like vortex that spread in all directions with astonishing lethality. Ordinary Foundation Building cultivators would definitely collapse and their bodies and souls would be destroyed."Both spells and my body are strengthened!" Xu Qing was in high spirits. In a remote place in the underwater world, he suddenly stopped. As the sounds of the seawater exploding in the surroundings slowly rang out, Xu Qing looked at his shadow. He then waved his hand and took out the black iron stick, glancing at it.The shadow instantly trembled. The Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick also trembled intensely. In reality, after Xu Qing activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, they had been keeping quiet.In that state, Xu Qing gave them a very terrifying feeling, especially when Xu Qing's Mystic Brilliance Form was much more powerful than the Mystic Brilliance Form of a ball of Life Fire. He killed a cultivator with a life fire as easily as killing a chicken. This made them extremely terrified."The assessment period is almost here." Xu Qing slowly spoke.

Chapter 232 Dancing With My Moon-Lit Shadow
This time around, Xu Qing didn't need to threaten the shadow much. Just this sentence alone caused it to shake.In fact, amidst this horror, as though it was an instinctive reaction, a few tear marks appeared.Emotions of anxiety were being transmitted to Xu Qing, as though it was afraid that it would be killed if it was too slow."Sea corpse… Eat… Quick breakthrough… Break through quickly."Xu Qing didn't care about the difference between quick breakthrough and breaking through quickly. He also didn't care if the shadow had said it in anxiety. Instead, he looked at the black iron stick.As the black iron stick trembled, the Diamond Sect's ancestor materialized from it. He had clearly made some mental preparations in this short time. As soon as he appeared, he immediately patted his chest and spoke to Xu Qing with a firm tone."Master, don't worry. At most, I'll eat a few more magic artifacts and the artifact spirit cultivation art I cultivate will be able to break through. According to my estimation, at that time, your treasured iron stick will achieve speed and sharpness comparable to the Mystic Brilliance Form under my control.""Although it can't be maintained for long, I'll definitely work even harder and won't drag Master down. I've also been studying how to self-destruct recently.""I've thought it through. I'm worried for Master. My life is nothing. If Master encounters a crisis, even if I have to self-destruct, I will open a path for Master!"The Diamond Sect's ancestor spoke passionately and kept patting his chest. Hearing his words, the shadow no longer trembled but was stunned.When Xu Qing heard this, he cast a meaningful glance at the Diamond Sect's ancestor and nodded."I understand."After saying that, Xu Qing retracted his gaze. With a thought, the life fires in his body were instantly extinguished.Xu Qing's entire body instantly dimmed and he returned to his previous state.The terrifying pressure also dissipated.After returning from that powerful state, the perception that reappeared in his entire body caused Xu Qing to feel a moment of discomfort. In fact, he even had an urge to continue activating the Mystic Brilliance Form.However, he suppressed this impulse.In reality, it wasn't just Xu Qing. To any Foundation Building cultivator, returning from the powerful state of the Mystic Brilliance Form to their original state would cause waves in their minds.The Mystic Brilliance Form was a super eruption of the magic apertures in Foundation Building cultivators' bodies. During this eruption, their magic power and spirit sea, including their magic bodies and everything else, would be strengthened by leaps and bounds. The consumption brought about by this increase was naturally extremely great.This caused Foundation Building cultivators to learn to restrain themselves and make reasonable use of their Mystic Brilliance Form time. Generally speaking, a cultivator with a ball of life fire could maintain the Mystic Brilliance Form for more than an hour.This time was the limit. Unless it was absolutely necessary, no one would challenge this limit.This was because once their life fire was exhausted and extinguished due to reaching the limit, their magic apertures would be overused and turn into withered apertures.Withered apertures were like trash and this situation was almost irreversible.Xu Qing silently sensed his body. After he got used to his normal state again, he began to inspect his spoils of war.This time, a total of four Foundation Building cultivators from the Sea Corpse Race had died in his hands. What Xu Qing regretted the most was the four magic artifacts that the six-eyed cultivator had used to resist his attack.At that time, Xu Qing had just activated his Mystic Brilliance Form, so he couldn't accurately control the terrifying power in his body for a moment and used all his strength to attack.The other party was crushed to pieces, but the four magic artifacts suffered the same fate as well."At least a million spirit stones…" At the thought of this, Xu Qing sighed and took out the storage bags he had obtained. After checking them, he felt a little better.The storage bags of these Sea Corpse Race cultivators were much better than his previous loots. There were about 300,000 spirit stones in total. It was a pity that there was only one magic artifact.It was the black-robed scholar's fan.This fan could also increase one's speed. Xu Qing looked at the Diamond Sect's ancestor who clearly wanted it but endured it, and threw it over.In an instant, the black iron stick pierced into the fan. The direction it pierced was very tricky. It didn't pierce the fan's surface but struck the lower part of the stick. This made it look like the fan had no obvious damage from the outside.He started absorbing the spirit energy in the fan. When the fan finally dimmed, the Diamond Sect's ancestor pulled out the iron stick in satisfaction and blew at the fan.This breath was very strange. After it landed on the fan, the dimness of the magic artifact instantly disappeared and it emitted a treasure light again. It looked no different from before.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  "It's fragile…" The Diamond Sect's ancestor said in a low voice. After saying that, he blinked and put on an embarrassed expression, as though he wanted to use this to emphasize that he wasn't a sinister person.Xu Qing stored the fan without caring about the Diamond Sect's expressions and words. At that moment, the two Sea Corpse Race cultivators' souls in his body erupted at the same time, instantly opening the 31st magic aperture."I need even more souls…" Xu Qing could sense that after he opened 30 magic apertures in his body, the amount of soul power he needed was a lot more than before. An ordinary Foundation Building cultivator's soul couldn't even open a single magic aperture now. Only the soul of the cultivator with life fire could do so.After opening the 31st magic aperture, the two souls' remaining strength wasn't enough to open the 32nd magic aperture.While the magic power in his body was increasing, Xu Qing rushed toward the exit of the underwater world. When he reached the exit, he charged out without slowing down.He followed the passageway to the outside world. As soon as he appeared, he saw countless Seven Blood Eyes cultivators whistling through the sky. The atmosphere of war on the merfolk island was very intense.As the rumbling echoed in the distance, astonishing energy fluctuations also spread in the sky.Xu Qing's expression turned solemn as he looked at the sky.There were more than ten figures from the upper echelons of the Seven Blood Eyes fighting against some Sea Corpse Race cultivators. In the distance, the battle had become even more intense.There were also rows of magic artifacts constructed on the four islands. The power of the spells stirred up various colored lights that surged into the sky and landed on the battlefield.Flying swords flew out of the sword nurturing pools, whistling through the air.It was the same for array formations.Clearly, this war had reached a critical point. The counterattack from the Sea Corpse Race was very ferocious, and the countless flickering missions in the identity token proved this.Xu Qing poured his magic power into it and immediately checked his token. Missions appeared in large numbers. Most of them were related to the battle at the frontline and they had extremely generous rewards. In the list of battle missions, killing ten thousand Sea Corpse Race cultivators could allow one to obtain a Core Formation opportunity. There were already seven to eight people who were close to this target.Xu Qing quickly checked and handed in the mission to search for the teleportation arrays. However, he didn't choose the next mission immediately.He was very clear that the most important thing in front of him now was how to explain having two balls of life fire.Unless he didn't display the two balls of life fire in front of other Seven Blood Eyes' disciples for a very long time, and only fought with one ball of life fire in normal situations, otherwise, he would have to lay the groundwork in advance. Moreover, even if he only revealed two balls at the moment of life and death, there were still many chances for accidents.Once he was exposed, he might be able to use the explanation of devouring souls in the war, the risk in this wasn't a lot either and the probability of attracting attention wasn't high, but it ultimately wouldn't be able to pass through an investigation which was a potential risk.The solution was also simple.Xu Qing checked his identity token. It showed that he had killed 15 Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race while the number of Qi Condensation cultivators killed was zero."Too little." Xu Qing shook his head. With such a small battle record, as long as outsiders were interested, they would be able to easily see through his lies.Xu Qing found a remote place and confirmed that there was no one around. He then looked at the shadow and calmly spoke."Didn't you release the aura of the Sea Corpse Race earlier? Emit it."The shadow seemed a little surprised and formed a question mark under Xu Qing's feet."Just do what you are told." The Diamond Sect's ancestor seized the opportunity and quickly reprimanded.The shadow felt aggrieved. After a long time, it emitted a wisp of the aura of the Sea Corpse Race. However, as soon as it appeared, the purple crystal in Xu Qing's body suppressed it and instantly destroyed that wisp of aura.After that, amidst the shadow's horror and confusion, Xu Qing checked his identity token and discovered that the Qi Condensation cultivators killed had increased from zero to one."As expected, it's like I expected." Xu Qing's eyes lit up. Previously, when he saw the shadow forming the aura of the Sea Corpse Race, he had been weighing how the identity token recorded the number of kills. Now, he was very satisfied with the test results.After all, the identity token was a dead object and the recording feature was relatively simple. It was judged by the collapse of the aura and fluctuations.Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be a problem. It wouldn't be easy to tamper with it either. As for many people attacking the enemy together, there should be another way to judge. Although it wasn't perfect, it was still acceptable overall.However, Xu Qing's shadow was bizarre… and a little different from the norm.This was the solution Xu Qing had thought of. He was going to accept a large number of missions next. On one hand, he would really refine the souls and open his magic apertures. On the other hand, he would rely on the shadow to farm battle results. Regardless of whether it was Qi Condensation or Foundation Building, as long as he had enough on the records, there would be a reasonable explanation for his two balls of life fire.This was possible due to the war. Not many people would have the time to pay attention to others and the number of Sea Corpse Race cultivators was huge. Hence, as long as he didn't go overboard with his battle results, the plan was flawless.The only thing he had to consider was how many times the shadow could withstand the suppression.Xu Qing only thought about this for a moment before tossing it to the side. He felt that since the shadow didn't die after being suppressed by him so many times, it shouldn't die so easily.In the next two months, Xu Qing began to accept missions crazily. During this period, he only used a ball of life fire's power most of the time. He would only activate his life lantern when he was fighting alone.However, he was wary of his identity token. When he activated the life lantern, he would use the shadow to cover his identity token.At the same time, he would farm a large number of battle results on every mission. For this, he had been forcefully demanding the shadow. Occasionally, it would reveal a wisp of Foundation Building aura and fluctuations, but it was only an aura and didn't have combat strength.It seemed to be the limit of the shadow's current ability, causing Xu Qing's battle record to have additional Foundation Building cultivators killed.As for the miserable state of the shadow, even the Diamond Sect's ancestor was shocked. It clearly had nothing to do with him, but for some reason, he was also afraid.There were a few times when it seemed like the shadow was really about to collapse. However, Xu Qing's true battle results in the past two months were quite good, allowing the shadow to absorb the Sea Corpse Race cultivators and barely hold on. At the same time, under Xu Qing's training, the combat strength the shadow displayed seemed to be even stronger than before. This made Xu Qing very surprised.Xu Qing's magic apertures also opened one after another, reaching 40.

Chapter 233 Fishing Out The Fiend
Just like that, Xu Qing's battle results were extremely good. The total number of kills had reached over 3,000, and most of it was thanks to the shadow.At this moment, Xu Qing didn't dare to continue farming results. He felt that it was okay now.He was worried that it would be too fake if he continued to do this. He checked the mission rankings and saw that the sect had really killed a lot. The highest ranked had more than 10,000 kills, and there were seven to eight people with above 7,000 kills. As for 5,000 kills, there were many with this record.However, Xu Qing felt that these people had some unique methods or only killed Qi Condensation cultivators. Otherwise, this number was impossible. It was too exaggerated.After all, the Sea Corpse Race wasn't that weak. Moreover, when Xu Qing looked at the name of the person ranked first and discovered that it was Wu Jianwu, he was speechless.He felt that there was a high chance that the result was falsified. With this person around, Xu Qing felt that even if they investigated the results, they wouldn't investigate him. After all, his result adjustments were reasonable, while these people were going overboard with it.Of course, there were also truly able people. Xu Qing saw that the person ranked second was the second highness and her kills numbered more than 8,000.Looking at the rankings, Xu Qing had a faint feeling that perhaps the sect was willing to see such battle results in the rankings even if they were fake. Firstly, it could inspire others. Secondly, the comparison could stimulate other disciples to work harder. Thirdly, it could also reveal the might of the Seven Blood Eyes and intimidate everyone.Xu Qing thought for a while but still gave up on farming battle results. He then began to search for the next mission that was suitable for him. He was a little tired now and planned to find a simpler mission.Very soon, Xu Qing's gaze locked onto an escort mission.The cultivators of the Second Peak mainly focused on alchemy, and alchemy pills didn't only have healing and cultivation improvement effects. There were also poisonous pills and all kinds of medicine. Among them, there was one known as the forbidden pill.The so-called forbidden pill was usually prepared for war. Once used in war, its strange might was difficult to deal with. It possessed many types of large-scale killing power that would cause fear in others.It contained mutation, attraction, and all kinds of astonishing astronomical phenomena. The abilities of each forbidden pill were different, and the method of activation was also different.Generally speaking, forbidden pills would activate immediately.Hence, most of them were semi-finished products that had been refined in the sect, and then the cultivators would complete them in some special areas on the battlefield.The first choice for the Second Peak cultivators to finish the forbidden pills were the many small archipelagos around Merfolk Island due to them containing many volcanic craters.However, the Sea Corpse Race also attached great importance to this and had divided some of their combat strength to kill the Second Peak cultivators in the archipelagos.That was why there was this urgent mission. It was to recruit Foundation Building cultivators to head there. While stalling for time, they would also escort the Second Peak's cultivators as soon as possible.The mission reward was very generous as it gave 300,000 spirit stones.After Xu Qing saw this, he was quite tempted. This kind of escort mission was more organized than entering the main battlefield to fight. As Xu Qing pondered, more than half of the 20 Foundation Building cultivators needed for the mission were filled.Xu Qing didn't hesitate and immediately accepted the mission.As the mission was accepted, a portion of the spirit stones was first recorded in his token. He was also given the teleportation coordinates and instructions to set off immediately.  novel online free at ռ0ʋɛʟɮɨռ  Xu Qing swept his gaze over and headed straight for the teleportation array. After entering the coordinates, his figure instantly disappeared under the cover of the array's light.In the southern part of the merfolk island, on the vast sea, there was a series of small pearl-like islands. These islands had been formed for a long time. Because they were too small and there were volcanic craters, they were not suitable for living.On the nautical chart of the Seven Blood Eyes, these islands were known as the Pearl Islands.At that moment, on the Pearl Islands, volcanoes were erupting one after another, causing countless black-colored volcanic ashes to fall like black snow. Accompanied by red lava, they were like rain that fell on the entire Pearl Islands.The black and dry snow and the hot and red rain soaked the Pearl Islands into a scene of the netherworld.Around the Pearl Islands, huge waves surged into the sky. Many figures walked out of the sea and quickly landed on the shore.These figures who walked out of the sea were all from the Sea Corpse Race.As they landed on the island, the slaughter and intense battle immediately intensified. Explosions and shouts rang out in all directions, and the fluctuations of magic power and the aura of anomalous substances were also extremely intense.On one of the islands, a large number of Sea Corpse Race cultivators had already killed their way to the core area.This was a valley and the ground was covered in thick black volcanic ash. Occasionally, hot magma would fall, causing everyone in the valley to have no choice but to activate their protective barriers.These people were all Seven Blood Eyes disciples, and most of them were from the Second Peak. All of them had anxious expressions as they kept looking at theFifth Peak's disciples who were doing their best to repair the array formations not far away.Because there was a volcano on this island, the Second Peak's disciples were ordered to come here and borrow the earth fire to bury the forbidden pills. However, the Sea Corpse Race's arrival was abrupt and ferocious. They had just buried the forbidden pills when they had no choice but to move before they could adjust them.With the appearance of the Sea Corpse Race's army, all the array formations here were affected. They had no way to leave. It was as though the Sea Corpse Race planned to use the Pearl Islands as a trap and a breakthrough point.This was indeed the case. The Sea Corpse Race's troops were divided into two groups. The army that was heading to the merfolk island was only feigning attacks to restrain them. This place was the main point. They were planning to use the Pearl Islands as the frontline command center and occupy this place to resist the Seven Blood Eyes.Of course, if the Seven Blood Eyes army came to save these Pearl Islands, the Sea Corpse Race could turn the feint attack on the merfolk islands into a real battle at any time. All the teleportation arrays on these islands were affected. Some of them were destroyed, while some were preserved by the Sea Corpse Race cultivators for personal reasons.They were waiting there for the Seven Blood Eyes' cultivators to teleport over and kill them to obtain contribution points.In the northwest of this island, in a deep pit some distance away from the core valley, a teleportation array was flickering. Around this teleportation array were dozens of Sea Corpse Race cultivators.The leader was an ordinary Foundation Building cultivator. He was a three-eyed nonhuman. He looked at the shining array formation and his gaze flickered as he shouted in a low voice."Everyone, be prepared and carefully detect the fluctuations of magic power. If the person who is teleporting is a life fire cultivator, destroy the teleportation array immediately. I hope that the person who came is just an ordinary one so that I can gain a good contribution."The Sea Corpse Race Foundation Building cultivator stared at the shining teleportation array with anticipation.In this battle, because of the unexpected breakthrough of the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor and his sudden intrusion, the Sea Corpse Race's ancestor was heavily injured.The entire Sea Corpse Race was in chaos. If not for the awakening of a few old antiques who were in deep sleep, the Sea Corpse Race would probably have faced a calamity.In the subsequent battles, after the merfolk island was occupied by the Seven Blood Eyes and became the frontline command center, the Sea Corpse Race's many counterattacks ended in failure. At this critical moment, in order to win, the upper echelons of the Sea Corpse Race didn't hesitate to take out a large number of resources and even rewarded some opportunities to advance their lives.As long as one obtained a certain amount of contribution points, they could exchange for these resources and opportunities. Hence, the Sea Corpse Race cultivators were much more active and excited.At that moment, the Sea Corpse Race cultivator beside the teleportation array was the same. However, he was very cautious. He was afraid that the person who would arrive would be a Foundation Building cultivator who had the Mystic Brilliance Form, so he had brought some magic tools to detect the energy fluctuations.Beside him was a huge eyeball. This eyeball had seven to eight tentacles that burrowed into the glabellas of seven to eight Sea Corpse Race cultivators at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm. With their nourishment, it was paying close attention to the teleportation array.Very soon, the eyeball emitted a white light. Seeing this light, the Foundation Building cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race relaxed. A bloodthirsty expression appeared on his face and he was about to rush over. However, at the next instant, as the teleportation array shone, before the figure inside could be clearly revealed, a black light whistled out of the array.It instantly reached the Sea Corpse Race Foundation Building cultivator.The expression of the Foundation Building cultivator changed and he quickly retreated. However, the black light suddenly sped up, doubling its speed. There was also the sound of a bell that shook his soul, causing the Sea Corpse Race cultivator's body to pause.At the next moment, the black light pierced through the chest of the Sea Corpse Race Foundation Building cultivator.At the same time, as the figure in the teleportation array rapidly appeared, the eye that was observing the array at the side suddenly shone. It was no longer white but red."Red magic power! Hurry up and destroy the teleportation array!" The injured Foundation Building cultivator had a flustered expression. The instant he spoke, the expressions of the other Sea Corpse Race cultivators in the surroundings also changed. They attacked in unison, wanting to destroy the teleportation array.However, at this moment, a roar rang out from the teleportation array. A plesiosaur rushed out of the rapidly forming figure. As soon as it appeared, its body expanded quickly and grew to a thousand feet in size, enveloping the teleportation array.Its powerful body blocked all the spells in the surroundings, allowing the teleportation to be successfully completed without interference.The figure in the teleportation array became clearer at this moment.It was Xu Qing.Xu Qing didn't leave the teleportation array immediately. He stood there and coldly looked at his surroundings.He saw the shocked Foundation Building cultivator and the dozen or so Qi Condensation cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race in the surroundings.He also noticed that he was near a small crater. As for the sneak attacks, although Xu Qing didn't predict it in advance, he was already used to being vigilant.Moreover, he had used this method to plot against others before, so how could he not be careful?Xu Qing retracted his gaze. The volcano in his body suddenly erupted and he directly activated the Mystic Brilliance Form.As the flames on his body rose and the terrifying high temperature spread, everything in the surroundings distorted. The eyeball that could sense magic power directly exploded, and the seven to eight Qi Condensation members of the Sea Corpse Race who were connected to it screamed miserably and spat out blood as they fell to the ground.The other Qi Condensation cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race in the surroundings also let out blood-curdling cries. Due to the huge difference in cultivation levels between the two sides, Xu Qing was already an existence that couldn't be looked at directly. It was just like how Xu Qing could not look at the Third Elder when he was at Qi Condensation.Although he wasn't the Third Elder, these Qi Condensation Sea Corpse Race members weren't like him back then.In reality, the feeling wasn't much different. At that moment, mournful cries rang out in the surroundings. Xu Qing took a step forward. His speed was so fast that he instantly approached the Foundation Building cultivator who had been pierced by the black iron stick.Amidst this person's horrified expression, Xu Qing pressed down on the top of his head. A large amount of black fire instantly erupted and covered the cultivator, rapidly devouring him.The Sea Corpse Race cultivator wanted to struggle, but the aura of Xu Qing's life lantern formed a terrifying suppression, causing the eyes of the Foundation Building Sea Corpse Race cultivator who didn't have life fire to widen. The magic apertures in his body rumbled and his cultivation base instantly became chaotic. It was difficult for him to resist Xu Qing's black fiendish fire as it surged into his body.A blood-curdling scream rang out.In reality, he wasn't weak. If it was before Xu Qing activated his life fire, although he could win against this person, he would have to go all out. But now, everything was finished in an instant.To Xu Qing, Foundation Building cultivators who hadn't formed their life fire were just easy prey no matter what race they were.

Chapter 234 Mission Change
Xu Qing didn't bother with the Sea Corpse Race cultivator who had lost the ability to resist and was continuously emitting soul power. As Xu Qing absorbed it, he looked around. The map mark given in the mission appeared in his mind.According to the map, this place was one of the teleportation points on this island. Its location was relatively hidden.And there was actually the Sea Corpse Race lying in ambush and fishing here. One could imagine that the current situation was already very bad.This didn't match the mission jade slip.Very soon, as all the souls of the Sea Corpse Race here were absorbed by Xu Qing, he walked toward the teleportation array, wanting to activate it and return.For situations that didn't match the mission description, the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples had the right to choose not to participate.However, not long later, Xu Qing's heart sank.The teleportation array seemed to be suppressed by some strange power. It could only bring people but not send."Interesting."Xu Qing simply rushed out. Under the Mystic Brilliance Form, he quickly appeared in the air.He didn't stand there foolishly. He rapidly moved forward and observed his surroundings closely.The souls he absorbed were also charging toward his magic aperture.However, after he opened 40 magic apertures, the soul power required for further breakthroughs became much more astonishing.He needed a lot of souls of ordinary Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race to break through even one.After looking at the entire island from afar, he looked at the falling black snow and magma rain before landing.He landed beside a fallen tree.The tree crown was charred black. The leaves were gone, leaving only broken wood.Xu Qing frowned slightly.He saw a large number of the Sea Corpse Race's army landing on the shore.He also noticed that the vast majority of places on this island were filled with the figures of the Sea Corpse Race.With so many Sea Corpse Race cultivators, there must be Mystic Brilliance Form cultivators. There might even be Golden Core cultivators.Hence, Xu Qing immediately deactivated his Mystic Brilliance Form.He didn't want to attract attention."There's indeed a problem with this mission!" Xu Qing was on guard.The mission didn't state that the situation here was so dangerous. Clearly, it was impossible for the 20 Foundation Building cultivators who accepted the mission to resist the Sea Corpse Race's army here. The difference between them was too great.At that moment, Xu Qing's identity token suddenly vibrated. He glanced at it and noticed that the mission he had accepted had changed."The Sea Corpse Race's army has attacked the Pearl Islands. Changes have been made to the escort mission. The reward for this mission is doubled and the mission task has changed. There's no time for delay. Do your best to head to the core of the island and evacuate the Second Peak's cultivators from this place!""The core areas of each island are equipped with the Fifth Peaks' array cultivators. In about fifteen minutes, the sect's Merfolk Island's array formation will activate the power of the tide for an instant to suppress the restrictions on the Pearl Islands. Disciples can teleport back at that instant with the cooperation of the Fifth Peak."Xu Qing looked at his identity token. The mission marking on it had already turned red. This meant that this mission was extremely dangerous."I just wanted to accept a simple mission to rest. This is a little annoying."Xu Qing sighed and retreated abruptly, colliding with a Qi Condensation cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race who had arrived stealthily.The huge cultivation gap caused the body of the Perfected Qi Condensation cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race to collapse and explode.Xu Qing didn't even turn his head. He lifted his right hand and a huge plesiosaur appeared in the sky, smashing fiercely at the ground.An astonishing impact was created, causing the surrounding trees to be destroyed one after another, revealing the figures of the dozens of cultivators from the Sea Corpse Race who were constantly retreating.These cultivators were all at the Qi Condensation Realm. Although their bodies had collapsed from the impact, their appearance here was abnormal.How could Qi Condensation cultivators dare to launch a sneak attack on a Foundation Building cultivator? Even though Xu Qing's Mystic Brilliance Form had been deactivated, he was still emitting Foundation Building aura. Xu Qing soon knew the reason.He saw some white threads among the broken limbs of these Qi Condensation cultivators.These threads were planted in their bodies and seemed to be able to control their actions and consciousness like puppets.The instant Xu Qing saw these white threads, two figures suddenly appeared on both sides of him. Their speed was extremely fast.These two people were Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race. One of them had a huge sarcoma on his arm and a gap opened on it, revealing pupils. This was an eye.This eye stared at Xu Qing as though it was probing. It quickly revealed a white light.This scene was the same as what Xu Qing had seen when he arrived earlier. Clearly, this was a method of the Sea Corpse Race to investigate if the Foundation Building cultivator had life fire.However, the life lantern in Xu Qing's body was covered by the shadow, so it was very difficult to detect.These two Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race seemed to have confirmed that Xu Qing didn't have a life fire, so they immediately used their trump cards to attack him.As they got closer, one of them performed a series of hand seals and a huge battle-ax with a dragon coiling around it formed outside his body. The coiling black dragon manifested and roared sinisterly at Xu Qing.As for the other cultivator, Qi Condensation cultivators from the Sea Corpse Race who looked like puppets appeared in his surroundings out of thin air. All of these puppets' eyes revealed a dark glint as they surrounded Xu Qing.  They also took out their magic artifacts and used them to increase their powers.They seemed to be good at joint attacks. The two of them circulated their magic apertures and their magic power actually resonated; a white bone hand vaguely appeared above Xu Qing and grabbed fiercely at him with a might comparable to the Mystic Brilliance Form cultivator.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Xu Qing looked at them and then looked into the distance. After sensing that this place was safe, the life lantern in his body suddenly lit up!Although the enemies didn't have life fire, a lion would still use its full strength when hunting a rabbit, not to mention that this was a battlefield.Xu Qing wouldn't slip up.At the next instant, a rumbling sound erupted as a volcano appeared in Xu Qing's body. Its light was dazzling and its aura was astonishing.Terrifying power instantly spread out, forming a violent impact that shook everything.The expressions of the Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race who were attacking from both sides changed drastically and their pupils instantly narrowed.The mind of the Sea Corpse Race member with an eye on his arm trembled intensely. The eyeball on his arm was flickering with a red light at this moment, as though it was warning them that this Seven Blood Eyes cultivator in front of them was extremely dangerous!However, this warning was too late.As Xu Qing's life lantern was lit, just the spread of his aura caused the two Sea Corpse Race cultivators' bodies to tremble and show signs of collapse.As for the white bone palm formed by their joint attack, cracks appeared on it before it could land.It was already shattering.As for those puppets at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, their bodies burned rapidly like paper!The huge ax that whistled toward Xu Qing turned red as though it was about to melt. The expression of the black dragon that was coiled around it also changed from vicious to fear and was already trying to retreat.All of this caused the two Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race to be frightened out of their wits.They had clearly sensed that the party did not have a life fire. They didn't understand how at the next instant, the latter displayed a power that completely surpassed a ball of life fire.This was the power of two balls of life fire. He was at the mid-stage Foundation Building realm. They were well aware of how terrifying it was!There were differences between different Foundation Building stages.Having life fire and not having life fire were even more different.The difference between one ball of life fire and two balls of life fire was similarly like the difference between heaven and earth.It was still possible for Qi Condensation cultivators to cross levels to fight, but because of this terrifying difference in stages between Foundation Building cultivators, it was almost impossible for them to fight beyond their levels.In reality, there weren't many mid-stage Foundation Building cultivators in all the forces. To a certain extent, such cultivators already had a very high status.They were all famous people.Only those who had two balls of life fire or more could fight them.Hence, these two cultivators didn't even have the thought of resisting and immediately retreated.However, in Xu Qing's eyes, everything in the surroundings became extremely slow. He looked at the two Foundation Building Sea Corpse Race members who were trying to escape and casually grabbed with his right hand.Immediately, the battle-ax at the side collapsed and exploded.The black dragon screamed and turned into ashes.The palm bone above his head shattered into pieces.The two Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race who wanted to escape were instantly enveloped by a huge force and swept toward Xu Qing.They were moved so fast and heavily that their bodies emitted cracking sounds and directly twisted.In the blink of an eye, they were held in the air by Xu Qing . The black fiendish fire in his body spread out and enveloped them, sucking their souls fiercely.Before they could let out a scream, the magic apertures in their bodies collapsed and their bodies exploded. Their souls were then swept up by the fiendish fire and sent into Xu Qing's body.Xu Qing turned and walked into the distance.All of this happened within an extremely short time.After Xu Qing disappeared into the distance, everything returned to normal. However… there was nothing left.The ground dried up and the vegetation dissipated. Regardless of whether it was the bone, the battle-ax, or the corpses, everything had turned to dust.The dust fused with the black snow falling from the sky.In the distant sky, under the effect of the Mystic Brilliance Form, Xu Qing's figure whistled past like a bolt of lightning, heading straight for the core area of the island.Xu Qing could understand the change in the mission.After all, the battlefield was ever-changing and many things were difficult to completely control. Moreover, to be able to adjust the mission so quickly was enough to show that the Seven Blood Eyes had sufficient control over this war.Hence, Xu Qing chose to continue carrying out the mission to head to the core area to help the Second Peak's cultivators evacuate.As for the other Seven Blood Eyes disciples who had accepted the mission, Xu Qing couldn't care less.At that moment, the sound of thunder rumbled through the sky. Because there was only a fifteen minute time limit, Xu Qing couldn't be bothered to hide himself. His speed was so fast that in just over ten breaths of time, he saw the core valley in the distance.

Chapter 235 Black Snow As Hair
The valley wasn't large.Teleportation fluctuation spread out from inside.Xu Qing could see about a hundred Second Peak disciples dismantling the pill furnaces and some magic artifacts that he had never seen before.Behind them was a medium-sized teleportation array.A few Fifth Peak disciples in green Daoist robes were trying to repair and adjust the teleportation array. From time to time, the array would flicker rapidly.There was an intense battle going on at the entrance of the valley.About 30 cultivators from the various peaks were guarding the entrance tightly, stopping the Sea Corpse Race that were approaching like locusts.As for the ground, it was covered in corpses and broken limbs.The intensity of the battle could be easily felt.The battle forces of both sides were mainly Foundation Building cultivators. There were two more cultivators fighting not far away. The intensity of their battle exceeded that of others.They were cultivators who had activated their Mystic Brilliance Form.The Mystic Brilliance cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race looked like an elderly human. He wore a tattered gray robe.However, it emitted an extraordinary energy. Clearly, it was a magic artifact.As for the Seven Blood Eyes' Mystic Brilliance Form cultivator, it was a tall young woman.She wore the orange Daoist robe unique to the Second Peak. Her figure exuded maturity and she attacked extremely quickly.However, the Second Peak's disciples weren't proficient at killing. Hence, although the two of them had a life fire and were in the Mystic Brilliance Form, the Second Peak's Foundation Building cultivator was clearly at a disadvantage.Fresh blood flowed out of the corner of her mouth but she didn't have time to wipe it away.In the Mystic Brilliance Form, the speed of the cultivator was extremely terrifying. If one was not careful, they would be killed in one strike. Therefore, one couldn't be distracted. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  The instant Xu Qing appeared in the distance, the young woman couldn't hold on anymore. Her life fire swayed rapidly and her speed slowed down slightly. The Life Fire cultivator from the Sea Corpse Race instantly seized the opportunity and blasted her chest.The young woman's clothes were torn, revealing her skin. She spat out a mouthful of blood with an expression of pain as she was sent flying back and slammed into a mountain at the side.The mountain rocks collapsed and cracks rapidly spread, causing many rocks to fall from the mountain.The young woman struggled to stand up but the life fire in her body flickered and extinguished. She spat out blood again and her face was incomparably pale.Seeing this, the old man from the Sea Corpse Race let out a cold snort. He didn't even look at the young woman from the Second Peak who was heavily injured by him. He immediately rushed into the valley, his target being the teleportation array inside.However, almost as soon as his body moved, his expression changed drastically. He abruptly turned his head and looked behind him. His pupils constricted and his expression revealed horror."The strength of the second fire!"In his eyes, everything around him moved slowly. However, at this moment, he saw a figure that seemed to pierce into his eyes in the horizon.It was rushing toward him at an incomparably astonishing speed.This contrast between slowness and speed caused the old man from the Sea Corpse Race to retreat immediately without hesitation.As a cultivator of a life fire, he was very clear about the difference between him and two balls of life fire… It wasn't any different from the difference between an ordinary Foundation Building cultivator and a cultivator with the Mystic Brilliance Form."Damn it, why is there a cultivator with two balls of life fire here? Only people of the same realm can fight against such a mid-stage Foundation Building cultivator!""The information is wrong!!" The old man from the Sea Corpse Race panted. Although he was decisive in retreating, it was still too late!Xu Qing had his eyes on him long ago!To Xu Qing, this Sea Corpse Race with a ball of life fire was the best prey.After all, the number of souls needed to open his magic aperture was extremely large. He needed a lot of ordinary Foundation Building cultivator souls to open one aperture. Even though he had killed the two Foundation Building cultivators previously, his 41st magic aperture was still not opened.However, if he refined a Sea Corpse Race member with a life fire, it would be completely different.Killing one would allow him to open his magic aperture.Hence, the instant the old man fled, Xu Qing changed his direction and no longer headed for the valley's teleportation array. Instead, he charged straight toward the old man.His speed was so fast that it only took three breaths of time for Xu Qing to appear in front of the old man.He punched out with his right hand. As the life lantern in his body erupted, a terrifying power surged.The old man could only dodge a little. Although he was also in the Mystic Brilliance Form, the difference between them caused him to be unable to keep up with Xu Qing's speed or completely dodge. Hence, in the blink of an eye, Xu Qing's fist landed on the old man's chest.A rumbling sound echoed like heavenly lightning.Half of the old man's body exploded directly. He rolled back and collided with a mountain rock, and was stuck there.The only reason he didn't die was because he had activated the power of his robe magic artifact at the critical moment and the magic apertures in his body had been overdrawn to resist the force of the punch.However, even so, the seriousness of his injuries made it impossible for him to recover. Despair appeared in his eyes.Xu Qing had disappeared from his vision.At the next instant, a black flame covered his sight.It was Xu Qing's palm pressing on the forehead of the Sea Corpse Race old man.The old man's entire body shook crazily. The shadow became crazy and eagerly pounced over, continuously corroding the old man's body. The black iron stick also rushed over and pierced into the old man's magic artifact robe, sucking fiercely.The three layers of devouring caused the Life Fire cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race to let out mournful cries, but it didn't last long before his body exploded into ashes.Only his Daoist robe and storage bag fell down. After Xu Qing kept them, he looked at the battlefield in the valley.Black snow continued to fall from the sky. The small particles of lava fell in front of Xu Qing like phoenix feathers.The faint red light of the lava shone on Xu Qing's demonic and cold face, complementing the cold glint in his eyes.This scene was like an ethereal painting that was separated from the world. It was beautiful but also filled with murderous intent.The battlefield instantly fell silent.All gazes gathered on Xu Qing at this instant. It was as though they were watching the divine son descend to the world.The cultivators from the various peaks who had received the mission looked at Xu Qing with intense shock. Gradually, reverence rose in their eyes as they bowed to Xu Qing.In fact, even the Second Peak's disciples and the Fifth Peak's cultivators who were repairing the teleportation array in the valley were the same. The way they looked at Xu Qing was filled with deep respect.Gu Muqing was standing among them. She looked at Xu Qing, who was standing in the air amidst the drifting red lava and black snow, with a dazed expression.This scene was so shocking that it left a deep impression in her mind.As for the Sea Corpse Race outside the valley, they were all trembling. It was unknown which one of them was the first to be unable to withstand the pressure from Xu Qing and retreated madly, but very soon, all the Sea Corpse Race members scrambled to escape.However, what awaited them was the buzzing of the black iron stick. There was also the shadow that was hiding itself. As the sun set and darkness spread on the ground, the shadow spread rapidly, fighting alongside the Diamond Sect's ancestor."Greetings, Senior Brother. Thank you for saving me!" Outside the valley, the Second Peak's life fire young woman, who was struggling to stand up, had a strange look in her eyes as she spoke softly.As her voice rang out, everyone in the surroundings did the same."Greetings, Senior Brother!""Greetings, Senior Brother!"At that moment, a gust of wind blew over, lifting the picture scroll formed by Xu Qing, causing the black snow falling in the surroundings to flutter with his hair.As the black snow drifted, Xu Qing lifted his head. His eyes were like the stars.As everyone greeted, miserable cries rang out from afar. It was the Diamond Sect's ancestor and the shadow attacking the enemies.The shadow could treat any Sea Corpse Race members as food. Although not all of them were delicious… it was no longer picky about food.As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he could only absorb the energy in magic artifacts, but he felt that his strength was inferior to the shadow's, so he deliberately pretended to compete with the shadow.He was using this to stimulate the shadow's fighting spirit and make it absorb the enemies quickly. When the enemy had no strength to resist, he would then absorb their magic artifacts.To a certain extent, the two of them could be considered to have a tacit understanding.However, compared to the cunning Diamond Sect's ancestor, the shadow was still too young.Even till the end, the shadow didn't discover any problems. Instead, its momentum was high and its expression prideful.The Diamond Sect's ancestor also cooperated and put on an anxious and vexed expression.The mournful cries of the Sea Corpse Race cultivators formed a clear contrast with the greetings of the Seven Blood Eyes disciples.Xu Qing's gaze swept past everyone here and then looked at the young woman from the Second Peak who had become very weak because she couldn't maintain her Mystic Brilliance Form. He nodded and extinguished his life fire.Although the magic power in his body was dense, it was very difficult for him to use it for more than six hours. Hence, it was naturally good to save it. However, if any other two-life fire cultivator could hear Xu Qing's thoughts, their scalps would turn numb; normal Mystic Brilliance Form would only last for more than an hour.This was because Xu Qing's Qi Condensation foundation was extraordinary.At that moment, Xu Qing's body swayed and he entered the valley.After extinguishing his life fire, the dazzling light on Xu Qing's body dissipated, revealing his appearance clearly to everyone.Previously, when he was enveloped by the dazzling light, outsiders could only see his general appearance. Now that everything was clear, the attention Xu Qing's peerlessly beautiful and almost demonic face formed was equally astonishing.Regardless of gender, the disciples were all dazed to varying degrees.The time the women were in daze was clearly longer than the male cultivators.Of course, this was also because of the halo formed by his previous strength. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so shocking.However, no matter what, Xu Qing's appearance coupled with the halo of his cultivation base caused the charm on his body to reach an astonishing level. Coupled with his purple robe and elegant long hair, he gave off the feeling of an immortal.As he entered the valley, the Second Peak's disciples in the valley were all respectful. Most of the female cultivators inside had bright eyes as they secretly sized him up.Xu Qing also saw Gu Muqing in the crowd and nodded slightly.Gu Muqing stared at Xu Qing with her beautiful eyes. Because of Xu Qing's nod, many Second Peak disciples in the surroundings looked at her.Her pretty face blushed slightly and she wanted to speak. However, Xu Qing had already walked past them and arrived at the teleportation array."When can it operate?" Xu Qing asked softly.The disciples of the Fifth Peak beside the teleportation array all had respectful expressions. One of the Foundation Building cultivators who hadn't formed his life fire spoke respectfully."Senior Brother, the teleportation array is almost done. I'm just waiting for the sect's array formation's tide power to arrive. I'm confident that the array formation can be successfully activated at that instant."

Chapter 236 Something Is Strange!
The Seven Blood Eyes was a sect that prioritized benefits, so the respect the weak had for the strong was even more obvious. No one was stupid enough to not let go of their attitude when facing the strong.Most of such people wouldn't be able to survive until now.Right now, the respect the Fifth Peak Foundation Building cultivator showed to Xu Qing was as if he was meeting an elder.No matter what his real thoughts were, very few people would hate such respectful attitudes.Xu Qing nodded. After scanning his surroundings, he found a corner and sat down.As he waited for the tide to arrive, he broke open the 41st magic aperture in his body.Life Fire Foundation Building cultivator's soul was much more effective. In an instant, Xu Qing's 41st magic aperture was successfully opened. There was even soul power left to attack the 42nd magic aperture.Although it didn't break, there were many cracks on it.Xu Qing was quite happy. He felt that if this continued, it shouldn't be long before he could form the second ball of life fire. At that time, although he would look like he had two flames, his actual combat strength would already already reach the peak of the three life fire.'It's a pity that there aren't many Life Fire Foundation Building cultivators. Whether I can encounter them depends on luck.' Xu Qing's thoughts spun as he pondered if he should try accepting some difficult missions next.While he was thinking, the disciples outside the valley entered the valley one after another and helped the Second Peak disciples dismantle the pill furnace and magic artifacts.Not long later, after everything was prepared, everyone gathered around the teleportation array. While waiting for the sect's tide, they also whispered to each other while secretly glancing at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's existence seemed to have become their backbone. Although they were on the battlefield, everyone in the valley felt some sense of safety.During this process, the island also rumbled and quaked many times. The sound echoed in all directions. It was caused by fluctuations from other teleportation points.The anomalous substances were becoming increasingly dense here.The sky darkened. The layers of clouds in the sky also became blurry, as though they were hiding some huge danger."Senior Brother, I buried many formation eyes on this island. Although more than half of them have been destroyed now, we can still see some scenes." While Xu Qing was meditating, the Second Peak's Life Fire young woman covered the torn shirt on her chest with her hand and walked to his side.Although this woman's injuries were very serious and her face was pale, it couldn't hide her beauty. She had an oval face, curved brows, and phoenix eyes. She was an extremely beautiful woman in her thirties. And since she refined pills all year round, the pill fragrance on her body smelled as good as the smell on Gu Muqing.Xu Qing looked over.It was unknown if this woman was doing it on purpose. Because Xu Qing was sitting and she was standing, the moment Xu Qing lifted his head, he could see the tattered clothes on the woman's chest that were covered by her hand. However, her hand didn't seem to be covering them accurately.Her snow-white skin seemed to hide astonishing peaks.Xu Qing expressionlessly shifted his gaze away and landed on the woman's face. The moment their eyes met, the woman from the Second Peak looked at Xu Qing's face and sensed the terrifying aura coming from his body. Her heart couldn't help but race.However, she quickly realized that she had lost her composure and hurriedly lowered her head to perform a series of hand seals. Immediately, a screen appeared in front of her.On the screen, one could clearly see a large number of Sea Corpse Race members walking out of the sea one after another. There were so many of them that it was a shocking sight.At the same time, there were also Sea Corpse Race cultivators in many locations on this island.There were even some who were approaching them."How much longer will the tide take?" Xu Qing asked."About 100 breaths of time!" The person who answered Xu Qing wasn't the woman but Gu Muqing who was walking over quickly.As though she had arrived in a hurry, her black hair was blown up by the wind and fluttered slightly. As she arrived, a few strands of hair landed in front of her and brushed past her beautiful face, creating a beautiful scene.This was especially so for her clear eyes and the refreshing and natural aura they emitted. This made Gu Muqing look like a figure from a painting.After walking over, she glanced at the woman beside her and bowed lightly."Greetings, Martial Aunt Li."The woman smiled and looked at the girl in front of her meaningfully.Gu Muqing then looked at Xu Qing."Senior Brother Xu…"Xu Qing looked at Gu Muqing.Seeing that Xu Qing didn't mind how she addressed him, Gu Muqing was very happy and spoke softly."Senior Brother Xu, this is the control jade slip for the forbidden pill here. You have the highest cultivation base here. The sect requests to activate this pill before we retreat. You can decide." As Gu Muqing spoke, she handed a jade slip to Xu Qing.Xu Qing took the jade slip and wasn't surprised that the jade slip was with Gu Muqing and not the Second Peak's Foundation Building cultivator at the side. He knew that those old fellows from the Seven Blood Eyes trusted core disciples the most.Hence, it wasn't strange for such an arrangement.Xu Qing took the jade slip and swept his gaze over it. At that moment, whistling sounds rang out from outside the valley. A group of Sea Corpse Race cultivators had appeared. Although they saw the corpses on the ground, the Sea Corpses still rushed toward the valley.While everyone in the valley was nervous, Xu Qing didn't even lift his head and continued to check the jade slip.After that, screams rang out from outside the valley. The bodies of all the approaching Sea Corpse Race members instantly showed signs of rotting. Some even melted into a pool of blue blood after taking a few steps.This scene caused the expressions of all the disciples in the valley to change and their hearts skipped a beat. However, the Second Peak's disciples were the first to recover. All of them stared at the outside world. While they were moved, they also looked at Xu Qing, feeling very shocked.They knew that this was poison. A poison that even the Sea Corpse Race couldn't withstand must be a specialized poison. Not only did this specialized poison require extremely high attainments in medicines, but it also required countless experiments.The former was fine, but the latter was the most difficult.This was also the reason why there were very few people refining poison on the Second Peak. This was because many times, before one could kill someone, they would be poisoned during the refining process.Such a powerful poison made everyone feel even more at ease. At the same time, the outside of the valley quickly fell silent. After all, under the effect of the poison and with the black iron stick and shadow taking advantage of the night to go out, it naturally fell silent very quickly. p1ease visi(t) nove1B(in).ne)t  Just like that, 100 breaths of time was about to arrive. Everyone here stood outside the teleportation array in batches, waiting for it to be activated.The teleportation array here wasn't large. According to the number of people here, it would take three activations for all of them to be teleported.Xu Qing also stood up and walked to the side of the teleportation array. Just as he was about to speak, his expression suddenly changed and he turned his head to look outside the valley.Almost at the instant Xu Qing looked over, a shocking fire shadow suddenly appeared in the night outside the valley. It was a figure covered in a white robe. It was rushing over rapidly from afar.Corpse poison emanated from this person's body and the life fire in his body burned. The aura erupting from his Mystic Brilliance Form far exceeded that of a ball of life fire cultivator. As he got closer, thunder rumbled.His speed was indescribable. It was impossible for ordinary Foundation Building cultivators to see it clearly. Even the woman with a ball of life fire was the same.The pressures on the minds of the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples' mind rose uncontrollably at this moment.From afar, it was as though a volcano was erupting in the person's body. Coupled with the corpse poison, it caused the flames emitted to turn green."Two balls of life fire." Xu Qing's eyes narrowed.This person was the first two life fire cultivator Xu Qing had seen on the battlefield.His aura was astonishing. As he got closer, the sky and the land was dyed green from the light emanating from him.It was as though a green palm was slapping toward the valley.The instant he got close, the figure saw everything in the valley clearly. He seemed to pause for a moment but soon, he laughed out for some reason and his speed became even faster.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and took a step forward. The instant his foot landed, the life lantern in his body ignited.Under the rumbling eruption of the volcano, he entered the Mystic Brilliance Form. The familiar perception appeared again and everything in the surroundings slowed down. Only the figure approaching in front was moving at a normal speed.Xu Qing instantly rose into the air, heading straight for the person.In the blink of an eye, the two of them collided in mid-air. A rumbling sound erupted, surpassing the thunder and exploding in all directions. At the same time, Xu Qing clenched his right hand into a fist and the life fire in his body burned as he punched out ruthlessly.The life fire in the body of the white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator burned as he also threw a punch over.The two punches collided. Xu Qing's entire body trembled and his internal organs were churning. He could sense how powerful the other party was. This strength surpassed Xu Qing's judgment of two life fires.He was very clear that with his Qi Condensation foundation and the existence of the life lantern, he would definitely have the advantage even against cultivators with two life fires. However, this white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator seemed a little different.He waved his hand; the plesiosaur manifested and charged toward the other party. At the same time, the black fiendish fire in his body erupted, forming fire daggers that also headed straight for the other party.Xu Qing lifted his left hand and in the blink of an eye, a heavenly saber appeared above him.Under the enhancement of Xu Qing's Mystic Brilliance Form, the might of this saber was even stronger and the range was larger. Its entire body was covered in black flames as it ruthlessly slashed at the white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator.An earth-shattering boom rang out.The white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator's body was blasted back. He didn't have it easy either and the life fires in his body were swaying.Xu Qing's expression revealed cruelty as he charged over again.Although the entire body of the white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator was covered by his robe and his appearance couldn't be seen clearly, his eyes showed a hint of madness.Xu Qing saw this madness and suddenly frowned. However, he didn't have time to think too much at this moment and still rushed out. In the blink of an eye, he collided with the white-robed cultivator.Booming sounds continued to erupt. The two of them attacked extremely quickly in mid-air in their respective Mystic Brilliance Forms. Their spells were even more shocking. They continued to exchange blows and attacked over a hundred times in just over ten breaths.After these full-powered attacks, both of them retreated. Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood, and the white-robed cultivator also spat out a mouthful of blood. Other than madness in his gaze, there was also intense surprise and a trace of… discontentment.Xu Qing stared into the other party's eyes, but didn't speak. The volcano in his body erupted and his body rushed out crazily like a sharp blade.He brandished the dagger in his hand and the heavenly saber appeared again. At the same time, the spirit sea in his body spread out to form a suppression. There was also the black iron stick with the sound of bells.In addition, Xu Qing also scattered a lot of poison when he attacked. After he rapidly got close, he ruthlessly attacked the other party's neck with the dagger.This white-robed cultivator was also extraordinary. As he performed a series of hand seals with both hands, the corpse poison in the surroundings instantly turned cold. It headed straight for Xu Qing from all directions, as though it wanted to freeze him. At the same time, a huge piece of ice appeared in front of him, blocking and attacking Xu Qing.Xu Qing had no choice but to retreat. As for the white-robed cultivator, his eyes flashed and he suddenly moved. It was unknown what secret art he used but he actually broke through the void and appeared in front of Xu Qing, grabbing at his neck. When Xu Qing saw this, to the surprise of the white-robed cultivator, he didn't dodge. Instead, he used his head to ruthlessly collide with the other party's palm.At the next instant, the two collided. Xu Qing's head was bleeding, while the white-robed cultivator let out a miserable cry. His right hand directly shattered into pieces. Just as he was about to retreat, Xu Qing had already stuck close to him and slashed at the other party's stomach.His speed was so fast that the pupils of the white-robed cultivator contracted. His mind trembled intensely and he suddenly retreated. However, Xu Qing still tore open his robe, causing some items inside to scatter.There were many types of items, but the most eye-catching ones were some fruits. There were oranges, peaches, pears, and among them, apples were the greatest in number…

Chapter 237 Vengeful
Xu Qing paused and glanced at the fruits on the ground.When he saw the apples and noticed the few large apples inside. Xu Qing was very curious as to how the other party had placed so many things in his robe.The white-robed Sea Corpse Race cultivator, who was originally retreating rapidly, paused for a moment. His headgear loosened a little. It didn't reveal his face, but his hair hung down.His gaze also landed on the fruits on the ground.After that, the two of them lifted their heads at the same time and their gazes met in the air.Xu Qing did not speak.The white-robed cultivator was also silent.At that moment, the ground suddenly trembled and the seawater outside the island churned. An earth-shattering explosion rang out in the distance, echoing in all directions like the roar of a god, causing the entire world to seem to stir up a violent wind.There was also a purple light that was like a sea of light from afar that instantly spread over. Upon closer inspection, one could tell that the place where this light and the rumbling sound came from was none other than the islands of the merfolk race.This was... the tide power of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation described in Xu Qing's mission.Under the cover of this sea of light, the teleportation restrictions from the Sea Corpse Race in the Pearl Islands were immediately suppressed, allowing the teleportation arrays on the islands to be effective.At the next instant, as the sky was covered by purple, the teleportation array in the valley behind Xu Qing that had been adjusted by the Five Peaks' disciples shone. The first batch of disciples standing inside instantly disappeared and were teleported away.At the same time, similar teleportations were being carried out on many islands in the Pearl Islands.Xu Qing saw this scene but didn't care. He could also sense that the second batch of teleportation was being prepared in the valley behind him. It seemed like it would be carried out very soon.However, at this moment, Xu Qing was more interested in this white-robed cultivator in front of him.The instant his gaze met the white-robed cultivator's, Xu Qing rushed out. In his Mystic Brilliance Form under the effect of the life lantern, his speed and power were astonishing. In the blink of an eye, he approached the white-robed cultivator. This time, he didn't target the latter's neck but his hair.It was as though he was more interested in the hair of this Sea Corpse Race cultivator now.The white-robed cultivator took a deep breath and the life fires in his body instantly erupted again, forming a terrifying air wave that spread out, dodging Xu Qing's grab. He fought with Xu Qing again.Rumbling sounds echoed through the sky. Xu Qing's figure was so fast that the cultivators in the valley couldn't see him clearly at all. Even the woman from the Second Peak who hadn't teleported away couldn't see his movements clearly. She could only barely see his afterimages.The ground trembled and terrifying collision sounds occasionally rang out in the surroundings. This was enough to show how dangerous this battle was.As for the white-robed cultivator, his attacks were also sharp. He fought Xu Qing fiercely outside the valley while protecting his hair.He was indeed extraordinary. The Diamond Sect's ancestor couldn't match his speed at all or get a chance to attack.Even the shadow was in the same situation. Compared to the white-robed cultivator, its speed was too slow.Only Xu Qing was able to attack fiercely. His magic power swelled and he punched out with his right hand. He then immediately dodged to the side. After dodging the elbow of the white-robed cultivator, he lifted his knee and ruthlessly kicked the other party's lower body.The expression of the white-robed cultivator changed.However, he was also a ruthless person. He slapped Xu Qing's knee with one hand. At the same time, he opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of dense corpse poison at Xu Qing.As soon as this poison appeared, Xu Qing's entire body seemed to be about to corrode. However, his expression was as calm as ever. After his knee was blocked, he twisted his body and his left leg swept toward the white-robed cultivator like a whip. His target was the head.The instant they dodged each other, Xu Qing performed a series of hand seals and waved his hand. Immediately, balls of black fire spread out from his entire body.They formed fire palms that headed straight for the white-robed cultivator.This white-robed cultivator's breathing was hurried. Clearly, he had consumed a lot of energy in this intense battle.He let out a low roar and performed a series of hand seals with one hand, pressing down on Xu Qing.With this push, the void in front of him collapsed and rapidly spread toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing's expression changed and he instantly dodged.However, as soon as he dodged, the white-robed cultivator suddenly sped up and appeared in front of him, pressing down fiercely.Blood flowed out of the corner of Xu Qing's mouth. After his body retreated by 300 meters, he sped up and got close again. Ten heavenly sabers manifested and landed fiercely.The eyes of the white-robed cultivator narrowed. He couldn't dodge in time and his body was blasted back by almost a kilometer. He spat out a mouthful of blood and rushed out again.When they got close again, Xu Qing bent his knees and ruthlessly kicked the other party's lower body again.From what he sensed, the other party's lower body was his weakness.The white-robed cultivator cursed but his voice was drowned out by the rumbling.Madness appeared in his eyes. This time, he actually didn't block. Instead, he bent his knees and ruthlessly... collided with Xu Qing's knee in the air.Xu Qing finally grabbed the other party's hair and ruthlessly pulled it off.A muffled groan and a miserable cry rang out from the two of them.The one who let out a muffled groan was Xu Qing while the miserable cry was let out by the white-robed cultivator. Although the sounds were different, the two of them retreated the same way. Their knees were bent unnaturally.However, compared to Xu Qing, the knee of the white-robed cultivator caved in as well. Clearly, his injuries were even more serious and his forehead was sweating from the pain. As Xu Qing retreated, his eyes flashed. In front of the white-robed cultivator, he lifted the hair in his right hand. With a slight sway, the hair turned into ashes and dissipated.This scene was exactly the same as a certain scene in the past. However, it was only a strand of hair back then, and now, there was a handful.After destroying the hair, Xu Qing was eager to continue fighting when an anxious voice rang out from behind him."Senior Brother, the tide is about to end. This is the last teleportation!"Xu Qing's eyes narrowed when he heard this. At that moment, a ball of black fire soared into the sky in the distance, as though it wanted to cover half of the sky.Among the flames was the figure of the Sea Corpse Race. From afar, it looked like a dwarf. He was walking toward the Pearl Islands with his hands behind his back.Wherever he passed, the seawater would split on its own, forming a large crack like a canyon. As he walked over, the seawater rapidly spread.The entire Pearl Islands was trembling. The terrifying pressure caused the sky to change color and the wind and clouds to surge. Xu Qing's eyes narrowed and he retreated without any hesitation, instantly returning to the valley. At that moment, the second batch of teleportation had ended and the third batch was ready to be activated.Everyone from the Seven Blood Eyes in the teleportation array was paying close attention to Xu Qing's battle. They were anxiously waiting for the teleportation array to be activated and also waiting for Xu Qing to return.Now that Xu Qing had appeared, the disciples of the Fifth Peak immediately activated the teleportation array without hesitation. With the help of the tide in the sky, the teleportation array instantly shone.As for the white-robed cultivator outside the valley, he didn't chase after Xu Qing.He stared at Xu Qing who was standing in the teleportation array. The two of them looked at each other and saw a hint of strangeness in each other's eyes.At the next instant, their gazes were blocked by the light of the array. The teleportation started and everyone in the teleportation array, including Xu Qing, instantly disappeared.After Xu Qing and the others left, the white-robed cultivator turned his head and looked at the sky. After discovering that the Sea Corpse Race's Golden Core cultivator had gone to the other islands, he couldn't help but grimace in pain.He rubbed his knee and also touched his head that was missing a bunch of hair. He cursed inwardly."What's going on? It's only been a while since we last met. How did this kid become so powerful? It hurts.""This kid should have recognized me. He actually specially targeted my lower body and even pulled my hair. How despicable. He doesn't respect his superior at all. Didn't I just pull a strand of his hair last time!!""Is it easy for me? That big plan requires a high-level corpse heart of the Sea Corpse Race. I can only exchange this thing with the contribution points of the Sea Corpse Race. I spent a huge price to pretend to be a perfect Sea Corpse Race cultivator.""I originally planned to come over to scare him and take some pill furnaces back to earn some contribution points, and also beat him up a little. I only wanted to take a photo of it as a memento as a revenge for the poisoning in the passage on the merfolk island, but how the heck did it come to this.""It hurts!" The white-robed cultivator waved his right arm that had collapsed by half. It was unknown what method he used but his arm actually grew back.After that, his breathing became hurried and he recovered after a long time. As he cursed, he limped to the place where the fruits were scattered.At that moment, most of the fruits had been destroyed under the attacks of the two people earlier. Only half of an apple was still there. He picked it up with heartache and took a bite after looking around.However, at the next instant, his eyes widened and he quickly spat it out."The apple has poison!"The white-robed cultivator cursed and thought to himself that this couldn't continue. As a leader, he couldn't lose face. In the future, he had to find an opportunity to undo another seal and teach that kid a lesson. He had to maintain his dignity at all times.Although he still couldn't withstand undoing another seal, he felt that he had to regain his face. With this thought in mind, he left.At the same time, on Mire Island, the figures of Xu Qing and the others appeared as a teleportation array flashed. As soon as they walked out, Xu Qing could sense that the atmosphere in the frontline command center was very tense. Figures kept moving past in the sky.The flames of war in the distance were intense. Everyone was even busier than before. At that moment, as soon as they teleported out, more than half of them cupped their fists at Xu Qing and bade farewell.The life fire woman from the Second Peak was the same. After exchanging voice transmission contact with Xu Qing, she left in a hurry.Gu Muqing was the same. Before she left, she bid farewell to Xu Qing. Xu Qing also returned the jade slip that controlled the forbidden pill to her. Before they had left, he had already activated the forbidden pill."Senior Brother Xu, my group's mission hasn't been completed. We have to go to another place to finish a forbidden pill. I heard from Master that our Seven Blood Eyes has been preparing for this war for many years and we will definitely win. There will be some larger movements next. Senior Brother, you have to be careful."Gu Muqing spoke softly with a hesitant expression. She suddenly moved closer to Xu Qing and spoke in an extremely low voice."I'm a core disciple, so I must complete some missions. However, Senior Brother, you actually don't have to do this, especially... regarding the missions of the seven guarding islands of the Sea Corpse Race. Senior Brother, you must not accept them..."With that, Gu Muqing bowed to Xu Qing and quickly left.Xu Qing fell into deep thought and took out his mission token to take a look. His rescue mission had already been displayed as completed and more missions were constantly refreshing.Xu Qing's gaze swept over, and the image of the white-robed cultivator he had fought with earlier appeared in his mind. Although the other party was from the Sea Corpse Race no matter how he looked at it and the corpse poison also matched the characteristics of the Sea Corpse Race, Xu Qing felt a sense of familiarity after attacking a few times.He was familiar with the other party's gaze and some of his movements. This was especially so for the apples."How did the captain become a member of the Sea Corpse Race? Could it be that he has taken a fancy to something in the Sea Corpse Race, so he used some unknown method to disguise himself as a member of the Sea Corpse Race?""Of course, it's also possible that he was unlucky and was killed by the Sea Corpse Race and transformed into a Sea Corpse Race member."If it was anyone else, Xu Qing would feel that the second possibility was more likely. However, if it was the captain, he felt that the first possibility was more in line with the other party's crazy personality."However, with the captain's petty nature, he will definitely be indignant. His cultivation is unfathomable. Perhaps he will find an opportunity to get back at me. I have to open my magic apertures faster!"Xu Qing revealed a serious expression.

Chapter 238 Mysterious Summon
Time flowed by and a month passed.In this month, many huge changes occurred in the war between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race. Firstly, the Sea Corpse Race's several counterattacks failed to take down the merfolk islands.They could only watch helplessly as the Seven Blood Eyes continued to reinforce the merfolk islands. At the same time, more magic artifacts and all their allies were teleported over.This was too much of a threat to the Sea Corpse Race.However, it wasn't that the Sea Corpse Race didn't have a victory. By dividing their forces, the Pearl Islands were finally torn down and occupied as the command center. All the forbidden pills buried by the Seven Blood Eyes were taken out by the experts of the Sea Corpse Race. Moreover, the entire Pearl Islands had been searched carefully many times before they confirmed that there was nothing wrong.To the Sea Corpse Race, this could be considered a victory in a strategic sense. To the Seven Blood Eyes, it was equivalent to making a careless mistake.Moreover, this mistake was extremely fatal, causing the Seven Blood Eyes to be in a passive state for more than half a month. There were two times when they were attacked from both sides and almost lost the merfolk islands.The Peak Lord of the Third Peak was ambushed by many experts of the Sea Corpse Race and almost died. He used a bizarre entity as a substitute and escaped with serious injuries.Even the Peak Lord of the Sixth Peak was also ambushed and heavily injured.As for the Golden Core elders, more than ten of them were on the verge of death. This matter dealt a huge blow to the morale of the Seven Blood Eyes. For a time, the number of people participating in the missions decreased sharply.This was actually also the drawback of the Seven Blood Eyes' rules. When the blew in its favor, its members could be like a wolf or a tiger. Once it was at a disadvantage, the disciples' morale would easily collapse and it would be extremely difficult to salvage.Just as the Sea Corpse Race increased the arrangements on the Pearl Islands, the Seven Blood Eyes' counterattack arrived.That was the night half a month ago. Xu Qing, who had completed a small mission and returned to Mire Island to rest, saw with his own eyes mountain peaks appearing on the surface of the sea.These mountain peaks were connected together and gradually formed a vast mountain range.As the seawater churned, this mountain range slowly floated up, as though it had transformed into a back…Xu Qing controlled the Forbidden Sea Plesiosaur and was shocked to see a huge beast under the sea.Xu Qing faintly felt that this giant beast was familiar. Very soon, he recognized it. It was… a sea lizard!The mountain range that appeared was none other than the back of the sea lizard!  Best novel online free at 🇳​🇴​🇻​🇪​🇱​🇧​🇮​🇳​ It was vast and endless, and its aura was astonishing. Compared to its body, the Pearl Islands was like an ant, insignificant.This sea lizard only flipped over slightly before the Pearl Islands completely collapsed.After the islands shattered into pieces, the sea lizard, which had only revealed half of its back, leisurely left.The sea lizard's attack was an extreme shock to everyone in the Sea Corpse Race. Such an existence… had already surpassed a certain level. It wasn't something the Seven Blood Eyes could easily request for help.However, it had appeared and its target was clearly the Pearl Islands.Xu Qing was also shocked by this matter. Shortly after, in order to increase morale, the Seven Blood Eyes answered this matter. In fact, they didn't hesitate to reveal a portion of the background of the Fourth Peak's Peak Lord.The announcement told all the disciples that the sea lizard's attack this time was thanks to the Fourth Peak. The Peak Lord of the Fourth Peak had a relationship with this giant lizard in the early years. This time, he invited it to destroy the Pearl Islands.At the same time, the sect announced that this matter had been agreed upon long ago. All the previous arrangements in the Pearl Islands were a cover-up. The goal was to let the Sea Corpse Race invade it. The so-called forbidden pills on it were just to bait them.The entire Pearl Islands was a huge trap prepared for the Sea Corpse Race.This matter caused the morale of the Seven Blood Eyes to rise immediately. However, the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes weren't fools. There were also scheming people in the Sea Corpse Race. From all kinds of analysis, they determined that the announcement of the Seven Blood Eyes said might be correct, but only partially.If the Peak Lord of the Fourth Peak truly got the giant lizard to help, there was no need to target the Pearl Islands. The Sea Corpse Race's guarding islands or the main island were clearly better choices.Therefore, everyone had their own guesses about the truth of this matter. Some even felt that this matter was related to the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor.However, other than the higher-ups of the Seven Blood Eyes, no one else knew the truth.However, it had already happened. The Pearl Islands were no longer around, and the Sea Corpse Race had suffered considerable losses.The Seven Blood Eyes also made use of this to launch an all-out attack. They blew the horn of the first decisive battle.The Sea Corpse Race's army continued to shrink and fall back under the heavy injuries. The Seven Blood Eyes also chased with all their might, breaking through layers of defense and moving the battlefield away from the merfolk islands to the edge of the Sea Corpse Race's territory.They were only separated from the Sea Corpse Race's main island by the seven guarding islands. That was the Sea Corpse Race's last line of defense.With the enemies at such a close distance, the Sea Corpse Race was under even greater pressure. However, the Sea Corpse Race stubbornly counterattacked and brought the war to a stalemate.Both sides had casualties, but the Sea Corpse Race suffered more.Even so, the casualties of the Seven Blood Eyes were still shocking, and this caused a group of cultivators to apply to withdraw from the battle. The Seven Blood Eyes didn't refuse this. As long as they met the conditions, they allowed them to withdraw from the battle.However, while agreeing their requests to withdraw from the battle, the Seven Blood Eyes offered more rewards for the war. They also distributed the first batch of Core Formation opportunities.In addition, they released two trump cards. The first was that the Seven Blood Eyes had given out 50 spots to use its magic treasure. Every disciple in the top 50 war rankings had the right to borrow the sect's foundational magic treasure projection once.Magic treasures were items of legends. The might of any one of them was earth-shattering and far exceeded imagination. There was only one in the entire Seven Blood Eyes.Hence, even if it was only its projection, its might would be soul-stirring.This news instantly caused a commotion among all the disciples in the sect. As for the second trump card, it was even more astonishing. It was… the ancestor taking in a disciple!The Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor would accept ten Foundation Building cultivators as inner disciples and three Golden Cores as personal disciples who would inherit his mantle after the war!The choice of disciples was calculated according to the completion rate of the missions and the killing of the Sea Corpse Race.As soon as this news was out, most of the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples were shocked. Some who originally wanted to withdraw from the battle even gave up on retreating and continued to stay on the battlefield.This was because the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor hadn't taken in any disciples for many years. One could imagine that once they became his disciples, their statuses and benefits would be extremely high.Becoming an inner sect disciple would be the same as leaping through the dragon gate. Their statuses were only inferior to the Peak Lords and surpassed the elders.As for personal disciples… Just the thought of it made their breathing quicken and their eyes turn red.Not to mention Foundation Building cultivators, even the Golden Cores of the various peaks were moved. Clearly, even they didn't know that the sect would release such temptation at this moment.From this, it could be seen that the Seven Blood Eyes was determined to win in this war.Xu Qing was also extremely tempted but he quickly suppressed the desire. Although this matter was enticing, he knew that there were many experts in the sect and he wasn't the strongest among Foundation Building cultivators. Every peak had cultivators who had formed three balls of life fire.With these people around, it would probably be very difficult for him to fight for the disciple spot even if he risked his life.However, Xu Qing looked at his ranking and felt that he could get one of the 50 spots for using the magic treasure.After all, this war score was different from the battle results, it was a comprehensive ranking that included missions and killings. At the same time, it also had a high requirement for the quality of the missions.However, because Xu Qing had crazily accepted missions and farmed battle results previously, his ranking wasn't low."73rd…" Xu Qing mumbled and accepted another mission.Just like that, another half a month passed. Xu Qing's ranking continued to increase with the missions and killings, reaching 59th place.More of his magic apertures opened as he killed the Sea Corpse Race cultivators, reaching a total of 44.The further he went, the more souls he needed.Just as he was frequently accepting missions, on this day, Xu Qing, who had just accepted a reinforcement mission, suddenly saw a summons order that specially indicated him appearing in his identity token!The appearance of this order clearly had extremely high authority. It directly erased all the missions on Xu Qing's identity token and became the only one.In fact, the mission he had just accepted actually gave him a sign that he had completed it, allowing him to obtain the reward effortlessly."Xu Qing, Foundation Building disciple of the Seventh Peak, come to the command center on Binding Island immediately. The Deputy Peak Lord of the Seventh Peak has summoned you!"Looking at this information, Xu Qing was stunned. After pondering for a long time, many guesses and thoughts surfaced in his mind but he still couldn't think of the reason. He didn't know this deputy Peak Lord and had never even heard of him before.However, the information on this identity token was conclusive. In fact, while Xu Qing was pondering, this information appeared many times and locked his identity token, causing him to be unable to continue accepting missions.After some thought, Xu Qing leaped up and headed straight for Binding Island.With his speed, although he didn't activate his Mystic Brilliance Form, he was still very fast. Not long later, Xu Qing arrived at Binding Island and headed straight for the huge eyeball in the center of the island.This was the core of the Seven Blood Eyes' frontline command center on merfolk islands.Disciples couldn't approach this place without being summoned. It was a top-secret place.As Xu Qing got closer, many terrifying divine senses locked onto him.Even the huge eyeball swept its gaze across him.Xu Qing didn't continue forward. He took out his identity token and spoke in a deep voice."Disciple Xu Qing has been summoned by the Seventh Peak's Deputy Peak Lord."As he spoke, his identity token shone. The eye on the ground quickly blinked three times and a teleportation power instantly appeared around Xu Qing. Before he could react, his figure had already disappeared.It was only after Xu Qing was teleported away that the divine senses in the surroundings disappeared.Xu Qing's figure appeared in a magnificent hall inside the eye.When he appeared, he quickly looked around. A woman's voice calmly appeared from behind him."You are Xu Qing?"

Chapter 239 The Seventh Peak Is Her Home...
This voice was ethereal and contained an otherworldly feeling.It also contained coldness. The moment it entered Xu Qing's ears, it transformed into a wisp of ice water that filled his mind and spread throughout his body, causing his body to tremble.Xu Qing's body trembled and his breath turned into white fog. His brows and hair began to freeze and his entire body stiffened. It was as though he had encountered an irresistible bizarre entity. In fact, Xu Qing even had an illusion. It was as though cracks had appeared in the surrounding void and surrounded him, as though sealing him.Not to mention the 44 magic apertures in his body.He could clearly sense that the magic apertures in his body had become dead silent. It was the same for the magic power and the spirit energy vortex inside. Their circulation was extremely slow.As for his life fires…In this state, it was impossible for his life fires to be ignited!This scene caused Xu Qing's mind to shake intensely. The sense of security he had obtained after forming his life fire instantly dissipated. It also made him deeply realize that to experts, suppressing the Mystic Brilliance Form was easy.However, it wasn't that Xu Qing didn't have any strength to counterattack. The instant his entire body turned cold, he felt the warmth from his life lantern.It didn't completely cool down because of the cold outside. Perhaps he had a chance to forcefully ignite his life fire.This realization caused Xu Qing to be even more vigilant. He was very clear that he couldn't let anyone know about the life lantern. After confirming again that his shadow was still covering the life lantern, he took a deep breath and turned around with difficulty.The moment he turned around, he saw two women who had appeared out of nowhere. One was middle-aged while the other was young.The middle-aged woman wore a red lady's <anno data-annotation-id="e891e00b-fa72-49d3-b645-e10122a2d7bb">gown</anno> with exquisite patterns of butterflies and flowers embroidered on it with purple gold thread. The lining was extraordinary, like the rising sun in the sky.However, the icy aura that couldn't be melted was as obvious as the coldness on her face, and her phoenix eyes which looked as deep as an ancient well.It was as though whatever she looked at would turn into ice. If others stared at her for too long, their souls would be affected too.At that moment, she was staring at Xu Qing.The clothes she wore weren't the uniform of any peak, and Xu Qing had never seen her in the Seven Blood Eyes. However, Xu Qing knew the young girl beside her.The young girl wore a loose light purple Daoist robe that looked like a long dress. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail and she carried an ancient sword on her back. She looked valiant and heroic. At the same time, her exposed skin was fair and rosy.She looked heroic but didn't lack gentleness. Like right now, she was smiling, causing her eyes to curve into crescent moons. She looked cute but at the same time, her eyes were crystal clear.She was Ding Xue.She looked at Xu Qing. As her beautiful eyes blinked, she revealed a spurious smile."Senior Brother Xu, this is my aunt. She's the deputy Peak Lord of our Seventh Peak and assists uncle-in-law in managing the Seventh Peak," Ding Xue said softly."Disciple Xu Qing greets Deputy Peak Lord."Being stared at by Ding Xue's aunt, Xu Qing clearly felt the coldness from the inside out becoming increasingly intense. Fortunately, his foundation wasn't ordinary. Although he was strongly affected by the middle-aged woman's gaze, he could still act normally. He cupped his fists and bowed respectfully to Aunt Ding Xue.This scene caused a hint of surprise to appear in the middle-aged woman's cold eyes. She sized up Xu Qing and calmly spoke."There's no need to be restrained."After saying that, she noticed that her niece's gaze was filled with brightness as she stared at Xu Qing. As someone who had experienced this before, she naturally knew what this gaze meant. She sighed inwardly and the coldness she emitted dissipated a little. Her tone also became a little gentler."I summoned you here to give you a sect mission. You will temporarily be Ding Xue's Dao Protector…""Aunt, we're friends helping each other!" Ding Xue hurriedly spoke first. She held her aunt's hand and shook it with a cute expression.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever and his posture didn't change, but there were waves in his mind. On one hand, he didn't expect Ding Xue's background to be so great. On the other hand, the power emitted by the cultivation base of this deputy peak lord gave him a similar feeling to the few peak lords he saw before.This contact also allowed Xu Qing to have a clearer sense of how terrifying a peak lord was.As Ding Xue acted coquettishly, the middle-aged woman's cold expression melted a little. A hint of doting rose in her eyes as she patted Ding Xue's head and spoke to Xu Qing."Xu Qing, you and Ding Xue are friends. I'm not talking to you as the deputy peak lord but as an elder. This is the frontline and it's not very safe. Ding Xue must participate in this war. I have something important to do and it's hard for me to be distracted. I'm worried about her safety and need you to protect her for a month. What do you think?""After you're done, I'll give you the right to withdraw from the war at any time and three disorder teleportation talismans."Upon hearing the words 'disorder teleportation talisman', Xu Qing's heart instantly raced.He knew that the disorder teleportation talisman was a type of jade talisman. Its value was so great that it surpassed many magic artifacts. Any one of them cost more than 700,000 to 800,000 spirit stones.Moreover, this item was extremely rare. It would immediately be fought over and bought by others the moment it appeared. Xu Qing had seen one in the Bright Artifact Pavilion in the Sixth Peak's Pengming District, but it wasn't for sale.The effect of this item was equivalent to gaining a second life. It could immediately teleport the user from the vast majority of areas. However, there was no pattern to the destination of teleportation. It could teleport the user in the vicinity or thousands of kilometers away.This matter was clearly suggested by Ding Xue. Otherwise, if she really looked for someone to protect her with three disorderly teleportation talismans as the reward, there would be a lot of experts fighting for it.Hence, Xu Qing glanced at Ding Xue.Seeing Xu Qing's gaze landing on her, Ding Xue blushed and smiled sweetly.The middle-aged woman shook her head. A hint of helplessness flashed in her deep phoenix eyes. After placing a storage bag in Ding Xue's hand, she calmly spoke."You guys decide." With that, she turned and left.Seeing that her aunt had left, Ding Xue hurriedly ran to Xu Qing's side and spoke."Senior Brother Xu Qing, that's my aunt. She usually doesn't stay in the Seven Blood Eyes but in the Western Reef Archipelago. Back then, when you sent me off on the sea, the one I wanted to introduce you to was her.""That day, Zhao Zhongheng insisted on following me. My aunt is a good person. She gave him an alchemy pill. If you had come with me, she would have given it to you. Zhao Zhongheng used that pill to form the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale. That fellow got the benefit for free."Xu Qing did not speak. A long time later, he looked at Ding Xue and asked.  Latest Chapters at​ ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ "The peak lord of the Seventh Peak is your…""He's my uncle-in-law." Ding Xue smiled.Xu Qing fell silent again."However, there are some contradictions in ideals between my aunt and uncle-in-law. Hence, many years ago, my aunt moved out of the Seven Blood Eyes to live in the Western Reef Archipelago. She came here only because of the war.""Senior Brother Xu Qing, can you protect me this time? I actually came here to increase my qualifications. The sect also has assessments for core disciples, and my uncle-in-law plans to send me to the Seven Sects Alliance. This requires my resume to be more realistic and good-looking. In addition, I'm planning to focus on vegetation in the future, so Senior Brother Xu Qing, can you also help me tutor during this period of time?"Ding Xue didn't hide anything and told Xu Qing what she needed. At the same time, she handed over the storage bag. It was obvious that regardless of whether Xu Qing agreed or not, she would give the disorder teleportation talismans to him.Xu Qing looked at the storage bag and then at the expectant Ding Xue.Xu Qing admired Ding Xue's diligence and eagerness to learn. Moreover, regardless of whether it was for the other party's Foundation Building jade slips back then or the three disorder teleportation talismans now, he had no reason to refuse. Ding Xue's actions also made him feel comfortable.Xu Qing nodded and took the storage bag. There were three jade talismans that emitted a gentle glow inside. The magic power on them was abundant."That's great. Thank you, Senior Brother Xu Qing." Ding Xue was very excited. After that, she tried to hold Xu Qing's arm naturally, but Xu Qing dodged her.Ding Xue didn't reveal any abnormalities. She still smiled sweetly and brought Xu Qing to a teleportation point, leaving the core command center.For the rest of the time, other than returning to her aunt's place at night, she usually followed Xu Qing and completed her resume at the frontline on the merfolk islands.However, Ding Xue was very smart. Although she was the one who fought for this opportunity for Xu Qing and had some selfish motives, she didn't make it too obvious. Instead, she dragged Xu Qing to accept some special missions.From Ding Xue, Xu Qing also knew that the missions of core disciples were different from theirs.The mission rewards for core disciples were even richer while the danger was clearly reduced. Most of them could be completed on the islands.However, correspondingly, as a core disciple, their connection to the sect was extremely great.If the Seven Blood Eyes encountered an irresolvable calamity one day, disciples like Xu Qing could leave calmly and not be pursued.However, core disciples would definitely be eliminated.As such, there were pros and cons to becoming a core disciple.Xu Qing wasn't envious of it. He felt that his current state was quite good. In the following days, he would bring Ding Xue to complete all kinds of small missions she accepted every day.For example, sending important supplies from one island to another, doing some aftermath work, tabulating some casualties, and so on.Basically, they were all safe and easy missions.When he was free, Ding Xue would ask him about herbs. Every time, she would give him spirit stones as a payment for the knowledge.Although Xu Qing felt that 100 to 200 spirit stones each time wasn't as precious as before, he still abided by the concept of gathering sand to form a tower.Seven to eight days later, the difficulty of the missions Ding Xue accepted slowly increased.For example, searching for some merfolk rebels and the hiding places of the Sea Corpse Race in the islands.The danger level of such a mission was already relatively high, but this was the frontline command center after all, so the difficulty was limited.The sect could quickly send reinforcements if there were any issues, so these missions were very suitable for the core disciples to train.Ding Xue seemed to attach great importance to her resume. She often took on these missions that contained a certain level of danger without being afraid of injuries.In fact, the more dangerous it was, the faster she would accept it.However, under Xu Qing's meticulous protection, Ding Xue was always safe and sound.This made Ding Xue a little anxious.This didn't match her plan.She felt even more anxious when she realized that the month was almost over. She made a decision. One morning, when she met Xu Qing again, she suddenly spat out a large mouthful of blood.Her face was pale and her body was on the verge of collapse, as though she would fall at any moment.Xu Qing was stunned. He sized up Ding Xue a few times and was a little moved.He sensed that Ding Xue's cultivation base was chaotic and her qi movements had formed a ball, blocking many of her meridians. It would be very difficult for her to recover in a short period."Senior Brother Xu, it's all my fault. I was too anxious.""I felt that I was too weak and wanted to break through to the great circle of perfection as soon as possible, but something went wrong with my cultivation last night and I suffered a backlash."Ding Xue stood with difficulty and spoke bitterly."My aunt also went to the battlefield and isn't here.""You should rest for a few days. When your injuries recover, you can take on the missions." Xu Qing comforted."No!!"Ding Xue panicked and hurriedly rejected him. She thought to herself that if she really went back to rest, wouldn't her injuries be in vain?<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="e891e00b-fa72-49d3-b645-e10122a2d7bb">Here, this is a casual gown worn by royal concubines or princesses</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 240 Broadminded
"Joining the Seven Sects Alliance is my dream!""Now that I have everything I need, I only need a good resume. I can't waste all my efforts because of my negligence.""I accepted 16 missions today. Senior Brother Xu, my aptitude is ordinary, so I have to work harder. Even though I'm injured, I can't give up. This little injury is nothing!"Ding Xue's gaze was firm."I can't disappoint my aunt!""Senior Brother Xu, can you help me complete the missions? Sorry to trouble you."At this point, Ding Xue's voice became a little weaker. After she finished speaking, she wanted to bow but her body went limp and she was about to fall. Xu Qing instinctively went forward to help her.Ding Xue's body fell into Xu Qing's arms. Her eyelashes trembled slightly and her breathing was clearly hurried. Her small face flushed red.Xu Qing faintly felt that something was amiss but he didn't know how to refuse. After all, Ding Xue's injuries were real and they were really serious.Just like that, on this day, Xu Qing helped Ding Xue to complete the 16 missions. Although Ding Xue was weak, the excitement in her heart had reached its limit.This was the outcome she wanted. She had begged her aunt to let Xu Qing protect her because she wanted to get close to Xu Qing and form a deep-rooted friendship.She was very clear that if she wanted to conquer Xu Qing, she couldn't be hasty.She needed to plan slowly. It would be best if the feelings could develop over time.That was why she had injured herself like this.However, she also understood that this plan couldn't be used every day. The sense of need couldn't be exposed too much. Hence, after she recovered a little the next day, everything started to return to normal.Every day, Ding Xue excitedly brought Xu Qing to run around the four islands.Another seven to eight days passed. Ding Xue felt that the time was ripe and was about to launch her second plan.She was confident that she could form a deeper relationship with Xu Qing with this plan. After all, she had been preparing for this for several months.However, what disappointed her was that an uninvited guest actually came at this critical moment.It was Zhao Zhongheng.For some reason, Zhao Zhongheng's cultivation speed suddenly sped up after Xu Qing stepped into Foundation Building. He had reached the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm and wasn't far from attempting to reach Foundation Building.Logically speaking, what he needed to do now was to enter seclusion to stabilize his perfected realm and start Foundation Building.However, he had clearly heard about what had happened here, so he resolutely chose to participate in the battle. On the first day he arrived on the merfolk island, he shamelessly came to Ding Xue's side.No matter what, he didn't leave and insisted on following.In fact, after Ding Xue got annoyed, he even took out the mission jade slip.He actually used some unknown method to obtain the same mission as Ding Xue. As such, Ding Xue was quite helpless.From the start to the end, Xu Qing didn't care about this matter. It didn't matter who came. He calculated the time. There were a few more days left before the one-month duration ended."Zhao Zhongheng, if you insist on following, there are two rules!" Ding Xue looked at Zhao Zhongheng unhappily in front of Xu Qing."Firstly, you can't speak the entire time!""Secondly, you have to maintain a distance of 30 feet from me!""If you don't agree, leave. If you agree, stay!"Zhao Zhongheng took a deep breath. When he arrived, he had already thought of this. Now, he looked at the incomparably beautiful Ding Xue with her curvy figure.He then quickly glanced at Xu Qing, who didn't seem to notice this. He hurriedly retracted his gaze and an unprecedented determination appeared in his heart.'No matter how high his cultivation is, how can it compare to my sincerity? Pursuing a girl isn't about fighting. What's the use of having a high cultivation level? My grandfather's cultivation level is higher. Wasn't he also dumped by my grandmother? Isn't Old Master Seventh also staying on the Seventh Peak alone? This means that a high cultivation base is of no use here!''My sincerity is the key to obtaining ultimate happiness. It's indestructible. The heavens can testify to it. Even if the fragmented face in the sky opens its eyes, it won't be able to destroy my sincerity.''If pursuing women depends on one's cultivation level, wouldn't the ancestor have a lot of wives and concubines? All the women in the sect would have been his.' The more Zhao Zhongheng thought about it, the more sense it made. His gaze became increasingly determined as he looked at the love of his life, Ding Xue, and spoke in a low voice."Alright!!"Zhao Zhongheng's participation made Ding Xue very unhappy. However, to Xu Qing, it was no different, although there were a few times when he realized that Zhao Zhongheng was secretly sizing up his forehead.This made Xu Qing feel a little strange but he didn't care too much, especially since the other party was tactful and didn't provoke him. Hence, Xu Qing ignored him most of the time.Several days later, the three of them completed some small missions and rested for a night before gathering again. Xu Qing glanced at Zhao Zhongheng with a strange expression.Ding Xue was also stunned when she saw Zhao Zhongheng.She glanced at Zhao Zhongheng's brows and then turned to look at Xu Qing. Her expression slowly became strange.Only Zhao Zhongheng's expression was as calm as ever. He lifted his head and revealed his brows to Xu Qing and Ding Xue, his heart filled with pride.If anyone else was here, they would definitely discover that the shape of Zhao Zhongheng's brows was almost identical to Xu Qing's.Regardless of the height, length, width at the end of the brows, and so on, they were all the same.Xu Qing looked at Zhao Zhongheng. He suddenly understood why the other party kept peeking at his forehead a few days ago. He was looking at his eyebrows.'Is this person crazy?' Xu Qing recalled Elder Zhao's evaluation of his grandson and felt that it made sense.Ding Xue sighed.She felt that Zhao Zhongheng was possessed. Some eyebrows felt different on different people's faces. Senior Brother Xu naturally looked better the more she looked at him. She felt that this Zhao Zhongheng was actually fine previously. However, no matter how she looked at him now, he looked really strange. He was like a chicken with two peacock feathers stuck in it.Zhao Zhongheng clearly didn't think so. He was very smug on the way. He felt that Ding Xue was clearly looking at him much more than before.  Best novel online free at 𝚗0𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚋𝚒𝚗  Hence, he began to stare at Xu Qing's nose.Xu Qing remained silent.Just like that, the three of them lived in peace in the following days, other than Zhao Zhongheng's appearance gradually changing slightly and the traces of the changes being conspicuous.What surprised Xu Qing was that Zhao Zhongheng's transformation wasn't just these. When the latter presented Ding Xue with a gift, he actually gave two portions.Ding Xue was also very surprised by this.Looking at Xu Qing and Ding Xue's expressions, Zhao Zhongheng felt even more smug.He felt that the meaning of his seclusion this time was far-reaching because he understood something.Since he loved someone, he had to love her dog as well.Since he had chosen to spend his entire life pursuing her, he had to be tolerant enough to accommodate the passersby in her life.So, why would he act narrow minded and only give her?As such, he gifted her two portions! Letting her give it to the passerby also showed how different he was from others.Zhao Zhongheng felt that he had understood everything.Hence, amidst the sublimation of his heart, on this day, Ding Xue checked a secret passage that was filled with anomalous substances and opened it. When the anomalous substances dissipated, Zhao Zhongheng, who was at the side, handed two medicine boxes to Ding Xue.Ding Xue took them and opened one in surprise."Peeling anomaly pills. This is a secret pill of the Second Peak. It's not sold outside and is rarely seen."Zhao Zhongheng smiled and nodded.Ding Xue had a strange expression on her face as she looked at the two medicinal pills in her hand."Senior Brother Xu Qing, thank you for helping me these few days and even tutoring me in herbs. I don't think Senior Brother will have any use for this pill, but because it's rare, Senior Brother can use it for research."As she spoke, Ding Xue smiled sweetly at Xu Qing and passed a medicinal pill to him."Moreover, this is also the reward you should receive for taking care of Zhao Zhongheng these few days."Xu Qing thought about it and felt that it made sense, so he took it.Zhao Zhongheng's breathing hastened slightly but he quickly smiled again and nodded at Xu Qing.Xu Qing glanced at the medicinal pill and was about to store it when his expression suddenly froze. He abruptly looked at the secret passage that had been opened and walked to the side of it."Both of you, step back a little."As soon as he finished speaking, Ding Xue quickly reacted and retreated. Zhao Zhongheng also hurriedly retreated.Seeing that Ding Xue and Zhao Zhongheng had retreated far away, Xu Qing stared at the secret passage in front of him.The location of this secret passage was under a collapsed house. Moreover, it was obvious that it had been dug out recently to escape.Some runic arrangements could be seen in the surroundings. Although they had lost their effect now, they should be mainly used for concealment.The passage wasn't big and could only fit one person. As it was opened, it emitted a chill that fused with the warm current from the outside world, forming some fog.In this fog, other than the dense anomalous substances, some corpse poison slowly floated out.Xu Qing was vigilant. This mission was accepted by Ding Xue. The mission description was to find the hiding places of the Sea Corpse Race in the merfolk islands. They had searched several places before but they didn't find anything.Right now, they were in a small city on Hidden Island. Ding Xue had used a special magic artifact to sense the fluctuations of the increase in anomalous substances here.That's how they found this passage.Xu Qing originally didn't care much. According to his experience in killing the Sea Corpse Race, even if there were really some members of the Sea Corpse Race hiding on the merfolk islands, they weren't something a Qi Condensation cultivator like Ding Xue could find.The detection of special magic artifacts wasn't of much use. Unless the Sea Corpse Race cultivator deliberately exposed their traces, there were too many ways to conceal the anomalous substances and their aura.Hence, in Xu Qing's opinion, the mission the sect gave to Qi Condensation core disciples was actually just for show, to let them adapt to the rhythm of the war.As for danger, there wasn't much.However, after Ding Xue opened the secret passage just now, as the anomalous substances spread out, Xu Qing sensed that something was wrong. The anomalous substances coming out of the passage contained corpse poison."Could it be that Ding Xue really found a Sea Corpse Race member?"Xu Qing's gaze was like lightning as he scattered some poison powder into the secret passage to neutralize the corpse poison inside. At the same time, he also sensed that the corpse poison here seemed to have lost its vitality and its toxicity was greatly reduced.While Xu Qing was pondering, a weak voice suddenly rang out from the secret passage."Father, hurry up and go home…"This voice was like the pleading of a little boy, filled with deep longing. It was extremely realistic. The moment it entered Xu Qing's ears, he felt as though he had really seen a little boy.This scene caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow abruptly. Ding Xue and Zhao Zhongheng, who were behind him, also heard it. Their expressions changed drastically."Bizarre entity?" Zhao Zhongheng's breathing was hurried.
