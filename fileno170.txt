On the afternoon of the third day, when Xu Qing's magic boat and the Phoenix were advancing on the surface of the sea, a sharp cry rang out from the sky.Xu Qing, who was meditating on the magic boat, opened his eyes and saw a pseudotooth bird spinning in the sky. Its huge and slender wings were more than 20 feet long and its green body had some mud spots on it. What was most eye-catching was its astonishing beak that was like two huge iron pincers. One could imagine how terrifying its bite force was.At this moment, the sea was calm like a huge black mirror, and seabirds showed up frequently.The pseudotooth bird was only one of them. Many small black dots could be seen in the distance. They were different types of seabirds searching for prey at noon.The pseudotooth bird circling in the sky seemed to have determined that its prey was Xu Qing and the others as it kept close to them. However, it also seemed to have sensed danger, so it circled a few times and was about to leave. Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the pseudotooth bird in the sky before lowering his head to look at the calm sea. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes but he didn't bother with it.However, Zhao Zhongheng, who was on the Phoenix, revealed a look of joy in his eyes. He smiled and shouted at Senior Sister Ding, who had noticed this scene in the sky."Senior Sister Ding, the sea record mentioned this kind of pseudotooth bird. It seems to taste quite good. I'll get it and we can eat it for lunch.""Junior Brother Xu, do you want to eat the pseudotooth bird for lunch?" Senior Sister Ding looked at the pseudotooth bird in the sky and smiled sweetly at Xu Qing.Xu Qing still had a good impression of Senior Sister Ding. The other party's eagerness to learn reminded him of his past self. Although she asked a lot of questions about herbs, she paid him as well. The value of the items she gave was almost 200 spirit stones.At the same time, after interacting with them for the past few days, Xu Qing had a deeper impression of the two core disciples of the Seventh Peak. However, he wouldn't carelessly judge all the core disciples just because of these two's performances.Core disciples were also humans, and as long as one was a human, it was impossible for them to have the same personality. Some were smart, some were stupid, some were vigilant, and some were rash.Among the core disciples, some were innocent, but there would definitely be those who emitted the same baleful aura as the gray-robed disciples who moved up from the savage environment at the foot of the mountain. Xu Qing felt that he had not seen them because he had come into contact with very few core disciples.As for Zhao Zhongheng, he wasn't bad either. He was just very stupid. As the captain had said, he was a good-for-nothing.Senior Sister Ding also wasn't stupid. She was just too well protected and didn't match this chaotic world. However, it was precisely this that further proved the strength of her background.This point could also be verified from Zhao Zhongheng's attitude.This was especially so when he thought of how her hand had been on her storage bag during the Night Parade of a Hundred Ghosts. Xu Qing was sure that she must have astonishing life-saving methods and was the reason her elders were at ease letting her go out to sea.Hence, Xu Qing reminded her."The surface of the sea is too calm. Something is wrong.""Coward!" Zhao Zhongheng sneered. He waved his hands, preparing to cast a spell to capture the pseudotooth bird.The pseudotooth bird that was leaving seemed to have sensed Zhao Zhongheng's intentions and stopped; its aggressive nature was stimulated. After circling in the air, it suddenly sped up and descended from the sky like a shooting star, shooting toward the magic boats.Its figure tore through the air, creating waves of sonic booms."Good." Zhao Zhongheng laughed loudly. With a sway of his body, he leaped up from the boat and was about to attack.Xu Qing became vigilant. He looked at the surface of the sea behind the magic boat. He saw that the area of hundreds of feet there was actually churning intensely as the pseudotooth bird approached.It was as though something was rapidly approaching the surface from the bottom of the sea!A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes as he quickly performed a series of hand seals. In an instant, his magic boat went into defensive mode.The instant the defensive mode was formed, through the eyes of his dragonwhale, he saw a gigantic creature approaching at an astonishing speed from behind the magic boat. In the blink of an eye, it arrived from the bottom of the sea and broke through the surface of the sea. Boom!About an area of hundreds of meters of the sea's surface directly exploded.A gigantic head that was pitch-black and covered in scales like a dragon or crocodile broke out of the sea with unprecedented ferocity and cruelty.The fishy smell instantly spread in all directions, and the waves churned intensely. The head opened its mouth and directly swallowed the incoming pseudotooth bird!The pseudotooth bird looked very large but compared to the beast's open mouth, it was like a small snack. It was instantly swallowed by the dragon crocodile-like mouth. With a boom, the beast's head fell back into the sea.The waves surged into the sky and spread in all directions, causing Xu Qing's boat and Zhao Zhongheng's Phoenix to be like leaves on the sea, involuntarily tumbling backward. However, the former was orderly, while the latter was on the verge of losing control.Zhao Zhongheng's expression changed drastically and horror appeared on his face.At that moment, he was already in the air. Fortunately, his speed wasn't very fast. Otherwise, if he had gotten close to the pseudotooth bird just now, the bird wouldn't be the only one devoured.The intense palpitations brought about by the line between life and death made him unable to block the seawater from soaking him. His face was pale as he retreated rapidly to the Phoenix. Even when his feet landed on the deck, he was still trembling.It was as though he was afraid that if he retreated too slowly, that terrifying mouth would appear again.However, as a disciple of the Seventh Peak, his intrinsic quality still allowed him to instinctively control the magic boat, allowing it to gradually regain control."That's… the plesiosaur. Senior Sister Ding, come here quickly. We have to leave this area immediately!"As the waves churned, Zhao Zhongheng, who was standing on the swaying Phoenix, spoke anxiously as he controlled the magic boat."Shut up. If it wasn't for your stupid idea to agitate the pseudotooth bird, it would have flown away. Why would it attack! The sea record mentioned that the pseudotooth bird is the favorite meat of the plesiosaur. It's obvious that the plesiosaur was attracted by the pseudotooth bird. If you didn't act recklessly, this plesiosaur would definitely have left with it."  novel online free at ｎ0ｖｅｌｂｉｎ Senior Sister Ding's expression was ugly. Although plesiosaurs weren't the strongest among the predators in the Forbidden Sea, being able to survive among the endless anomalous substances meant that they were ferocious. Moreover, it was very difficult to judge the strength of each of them by their cultivation.After all, with its huge body, unless the difference in combat strength was obvious, there was a high chance that the victory would belong to it.Zhao Zhongheng wanted to defend himself, but he couldn't say anything. He could only reply bitterly."Maybe it will leave in a while…"Senior Sister Ding's intrinsic quality was clearly much better than Zhao Zhongheng's. At this moment, even though her emotions were in turmoil, she still circulated all her cultivation and took out a green longsword.At the same time, she placed her right hand on her storage bag, ready to take out her trump card at any time. She then looked at the sea warily.Compared to the two of them, Xu Qing was much calmer. He had sensed that something was wrong with this sea area earlier, so he got the magic boat to use the defensive state in advance.The huge waves rolled over like a giant's large hand, ruthlessly slapping Xu Qing's magic boat, causing it to keep moving away in the waves.However, overall, the magic boat's stability was very good, so it didn't lose control. Instead, it retreated in an orderly manner with the help of the waves.His calmness also calmed Senior Sister Ding's emotions. Her gaze slowly turned sharp."It didn't leave!" Xu Qing's eyes gleamed as he spoke in a low voice.

Chapter 142 Using The Sea Enlightenment Art (1)
Through the dragonwhale in the sea, Xu Qing could clearly see that the terrifying existence at the bottom of the sea had yet to leave.Instead, it twisted its body and stopped in the distance. Its dragon or crocodile-like head was facing them.Its cold gaze revealed a killing intent as it locked onto Xu Qing's boat and the dragonwhale below. It seemed to be weighing the strength of its prey before it moved for the kill.Its body was like a huge penguin, more than 2,000 feet tall. Its four majestic dragon fins swayed slightly, and barnacles grew all over them, emitting countless tiny tentacles. The most astonishing thing was its exaggerated and slender neck, which had a row of sharp black spikes.It was indeed a plesiosaur!This was one of the common hunters in the Forbidden Sea that had been mentioned in the sea record.Xu Qing's breathing hastened slightly but he still maintained his composure. His experience in the forbidden zone's jungle allowed him to know that unless there was no possibility of fighting against a powerful ferocious beast, he couldn't show any fear.This was especially so for the plesiosaur that the sea record had described. It was cautious by nature, so once it felt that the enemy wasn't someone to be trifled with, it would leave.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes."The two of you, spread out your cultivation bases and form a deterrence!"Senior Sister Ding didn't say a word and immediately did as she was told. Her cultivation base erupted even more intensely, forming fluctuations. Although Zhao Zhongheng was stupid, he wasn't hopelessly stupid. He hurriedly spread out his cultivation and even controlled the Phoenix to assume an attacking posture.All of this caused the plesiosaur to be a little restless. Its body slowly moved, but it clearly didn't want to give up.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and let out a cold snort. He then performed a one-handed seal and the eight-winged sail on the magic boat immediately contracted. At the same time that the protective barrier was fully activated, the cultivation base in his body circulated at full force.Amidst the rumbling, the aura of the eighth level of the Mountains and Seas Art erupted. A shadow appeared behind him.It had dry and cracked skin, green body, spiral horn, and red crazed eyes. The moment Ba appeared, it let out a ferocious roar toward the bottom of the sea.An astonishingly high temperature spread out fiercely.This high temperature was strange, like it couldn't be extinguished. Water vapor appeared on the surrounding sea, causing the surroundings to be a little hazy. The plesiosaur immediately became restless, as though it was very uncomfortable with this sudden change. It began to retreat, but the extent wasn't great.This scene caused Senior Sister Ding's eyes to widen, revealing intense light. Zhao Zhongheng even gasped. The gaze he used to look at Xu Qing once again revealed astonishment.Xu Qing didn't bother with the two of them. At that moment, all his attention was on the plesiosaur. After using the Mountains and Seas Art, he also circulated his Sea Transformation Art with all his might without hesitation. Immediately, the seawater in the surroundings of the magic boat transformed into wild undercurrents. There was also the violent aura of the dragonwhale that locked onto the plesiosaur.Not only that, but the horn and four legs of Xu Qing's magic boat also emitted a resplendent light that carried intense deterrence as it spread out.,m The devouring power contained in the horn and the 3,000 blades in each leg were all prepared to erupt at this moment. The chill was astonishing, causing the plesiosaur's entire body to tremble. The spikes on its neck swayed rapidly. Clearly, it felt an intense threat and was in a standoff with Xu Qing. Xu Qing's gaze fused with the dragonwhale's eyes as he stared coldly.Just like that, the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed.The plesiosaur sensed that Xu Qing wasn't someone to be trifled with. It circled around and slowly retreated. In the end, it gave up on hunting, disappearing into the distance.Xu Qing didn't let down his guard. He maintained a fully armed state and controlled the magic boat to move. Only after the magic boat had completely left this sea area for a long while did he let out a deep breath.At the side, Senior Sister Ding and Zhao Zhongheng on the Phoenix heaved a sigh of relief."The sea record said that this sea beast doesn't like to take risks and will only attack when it is 100% confident. As expected."Xu Qing looked at the sea in front of him.He knew that this place was actually just the coastal area. It was far from the deep sea area.However, even so, it was already so dangerous. One could imagine that the entire sea must be extremely strange and dangerous.Xu Qing's gaze landed on the fragmented-face of the god in the sky.Everything was because of His arrival. n,0,v,e,1,b,i,n[dot]n,e,t  His appearance changed all living beings, making everything even more ferocious and terrifying.Xu Qing looked at the sea silently. The image of the plesiosaur from earlier slowly emerged in his mind and a look of contemplation appeared in his eyes."Its appearance seems to be more suitable for survival in the Forbidden Sea."Xu Qing pondered. After he sat down cross-legged, he performed a series of hand seals with both hands. Immediately, the appearance of the dragonwhale under his magic boat slowly changed under his attempts.At the same time, Senior Sister Ding and Zhao Zhongheng, who had escaped danger, heaved a sigh of relief. They also looked at Xu Qing. The former's expression became brighter, while the latter's bitterness and horror still lingered.Although they didn't see Xu Qing attack, the might of his aura, the terror of the Ba shadow, and the existence of the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale made the two of them very clear that Xu Qing was even stronger than they had imagined."Blood and Qi turning into shadow. Not only did this Xu guy form the Forbidden Sea Dragonwhale with the Sea Transformation Art, but his body refinement has also reached the great circle of perfection. How can he be so strong!!""Not only is this Junior Brother Xu good-looking, but his cultivation level is even deeper than what I judged previously. Moreover, he might have some hidden cards that he hasn't used yet. There's a high chance that such a person can reach the Foundation Building realm in the future…"Just when they were thinking of different things, the changes in the dragonwhale under Xu Qing's magic boat were getting bigger and bigger.

Chapter 143 Using The Sea Enlightenment Art (2)
Its neck gradually became slender, and a row of sharp spikes appeared on it. Four flippers extended from its body, and it looked more and more like a plesiosaur.The feeling of cruelty it gave off grew increasingly intense as it changed.Before he saw the plesiosaur, Xu Qing couldn't make microscopic changes. However, now that he had seen it, he felt that the other party's appearance would increase the dragonwhale's speed and increase its agility and attack power in hunting.At the same time, in the dragonwhale's surroundings, as the Sea Transformation Art circulated, swordfish formed and pseudotooth birds also appeared. There was even a small giant figure that slowly formed amidst the gathering of water droplets.At the next instant, as the surface of the sea rumbled, the dragonwhale that had its appearance changed by Xu Qing broke through the surface of the sea and flew out. It let out a roar in the air and swordfishes followed it, forming rainbows under the sunlight.Senior Sister Ding and Zhao Zhongheng's eyes widened. After sensing the spirit energy fluctuations that belonged to the Seventh Peak's Sea Transformation Art, they were stunned.Not all disciples at the eighth level of the Sea Transformation Art could possess extreme control to form a dragonwhale.Not all disciples who formed the dragonwhale could grasp extreme control over it and change its form.All of this caused Senior Sister Ding and Zhao Zhongheng, who were already shocked, to be even more shaken.Regardless of whether it was the plesiosaur or the swordfishes, these weren't the spell patterns recorded in the Sea Transformation Art but Xu Qing's comprehension from this trip to the sea.The sea was like a Dao teacher.At the same time, it was profound and supernatural. When one was beside it, some insightful people could silently achieve enlightenment.Time slowly passed just like that. On the way, Zhao Zhongheng felt even more bitter and dejected. He had completely realized that he couldn't afford to offend this Xu Qing. The probability of Xu Qing reaching the Foundation Building realm in the future was extremely high. Once he reached the Foundation Building realm, he would have to respectfully greet him.He didn't even have the thought of asking his grandfather for help. It wasn't like he hadn't encountered similar situations in the past. However, although the other party ended up in a miserable state, he also ended up in an equally miserable state. There were a few times when he thought that his grandfather would beat him to death.He could only pray in his heart that the journey would end early and Xu Qing would leave.As if his prayers were answered, the sea was calm for the next few days and the three of them didn't encounter any danger. The magic boats gradually got closer and closer to the Western Reef Archipelago until the outline of the archipelago could be seen in the distance.As for Senior Sister Ding's enthusiasm, it continued to rise on the way. Ever since she boarded the ship, the materials she had given in order to obtain knowledge were worth more than 300 spirit stones.This allowed Xu Qing to see Senior Sister Ding's thirst for knowledge. He felt that the other party was a good person. After all, if his hunt at sea wasn't smooth, his gains might not even be that much…  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 However, when he thought about how he had spent a large amount of cultivation time to guide the other party and clear her doubts about herbs, and how he had the responsibility to protect her along the way, Xu Qing weighed the pros and cons in his heart and felt that the transaction was very reasonable.In the last half a day, Xu Qing still patiently answered Senior Sister Ding's questions. However, he didn't accept any more materials from her. He admired Senior Sister Ding's eagerness to learn.When Zhao Zhongheng saw this scene, he sighed in despair in his heart. He felt that if a gigolo started to not take money, it was because the latter had developed feelings… He looked at the distant Western Reef Archipelago and wished they could reach there immediately and end the voyage so that Xu Qing could leave.Just like that, dusk gradually passed. As the three of them sailed, no matter how reluctant Senior Sister Ding was, the Western Reef Archipelago became clearer and clearer in their eyes.When they arrived at the destination of Senior Sister Ding's trip, Zhao Zhongheng was extremely excited. He looked expectantly at Senior Sister Ding."Junior Brother Xu, are you really not coming with us? I am here to visit an elder. It's my aunt. Her cultivation is profound and she likes to guide the younger generation. If you come, you will definitely gain a lot." Before Senior Sister Ding got off the boat, she tried to persuade Xu Qing.Zhao Zhongheng's heart instantly skipped a beat. His heart was in his throat as he stared fixedly at Xu Qing, afraid that Xu Qing would agree. "I'm not going. I still have other things to deal with. Senior Sister Ding, take care."A polite smile appeared on Xu Qing's face. After Senior Sister Ding slowly got off the magic boat while turning around to look at Xu Qing again and again, Xu Qing's magic boat let out a muffled sound and slowly retreated. It then changed directions and sailed toward the distance.On the shore of the island behind him, Senior Sister Ding's Daoist robe and hair fluttered in the wind. She lifted her beautiful face and her bright eyes looked at Xu Qing who was on the magic boat. She suddenly spoke loudly."Junior Brother Xu, take care. After this voyage ends and we return to the sect, I'll continue to seek guidance from you."Zhao Zhongheng's heart skipped a beat again and his face fell.Xu Qing nodded slightly and waved his hand. He then controlled the magic boat and gradually sailed into the sea.As he left the island and the magic boat returned to peace, Xu Qing's expression also became sharp amidst the calmness.Standing on the magic boat, he slowly seemed to have transformed into a sharp sword that was about to be unsheathed. His gaze turned cold as he stared at the Forbidden Sea behind the distant archipelago.That direction was his destination, the location of the Sea Lizard Island.At his current speed, he would be able to reach it in two days at most. As a public resource point that produced sea lizard skin, there must be killings and fights there.A cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. After many days at sea, he was even more familiar with the Forbidden Sea. At the same time, he was also prepared to make a move."I have to be more vigilant..."Xu Qing mumbled and waved his right hand. Immediately, the magic boat erupted with speed again and whistled forward on the surface of the sea. According to the nautical chart, it was getting closer and closer to the Sea Lizard Island.On the way, he began to organize his dagger, put on his boxing gloves, sharpened the black iron stick, and checked his poison.One day, two days...On the third day, dusk filled the sky and the afterglow of dusk shone through the gaps in the dark clouds onto the sea. The wind on the sea was clearly much more violent as an island appeared before Xu Qing.The entire island was pitch-black, as though it was enveloped in dark clouds, as though there were ferocious beasts hidden there. Rot and humidity lingered around it, revealing desolation and death.Hundreds of boats were floating in the surroundings. Each of them had their own differences, but they weren't the Seventh Peak's magic boats.There were also some human and beast corpses that had died for an unknown period of time on the beach, giving off a cold feeling.Looking further up, the island was surrounded by a black-colored mountain jungle and mountains. The murderous aura in the air carried a sense of oppression. Just like the black clouds in the dusk at this moment, it pressed down deeply and filled the surroundings.As Xu Qing's magic boat got closer, many gazes that were hiding in the mountains and jungle instantly opened and coldly locked onto Xu Qing.Xu Qing could clearly sense the hostility in the gazes. He slowly narrowed his eyes. His expression was calm but his body emitted an aura as sharp as a blade.It was as though he had transformed into a fierce wolf, causing those gazes to stop and retract one after another.Xu Qing was expressionless. With a sway of his body, he stepped onto the beach and kept the magic boat. He flicked the dust off his body and walked toward the jungle. When he passed by the corpses that were everywhere, he would glance at them

Chapter 144 Demon Lands On The Island (1)
The grayish-brown broken bones were scattered on the black beach. Some of them had weathered and were rough like sand. Some of them didn't seem to have died for long and there were still pieces of rotting flesh hanging on them.The sea breeze blew over, stirring up the gravel on the ground. It then piled up in the human and beast skulls and curled up.The entire Sea Lizard Island was reflected in Xu Qing's eyes. It was filled with gloom and cruelty. Only the setting sun that was like a red fallen leaf falling onto the beach seemed to have covered their deaths with a pall.Unfortunately, this pall was also red.Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the broken bones in the surroundings. As the world gradually darkened, he calmly walked toward the jungle. As he got closer, his figure disappeared.The moment he stepped into the jungle, the dark night covered him like a pair of large hands. The sky was pitch-black and the sun had stepped aside.In the jungle, Xu Qing's figure was like a ghost. His speed was extremely fast as he moved on the large trees. His gaze was like a pseudotooth bird's. As he moved forward, he calmly observed his surroundings.Xu Qing wasn't unfamiliar with the jungle.Although this was an island and not the forbidden zone back then, the experience of surviving in the jungle would work here as well. This was especially so for the vegetation on the ground. There were also some common medicinal herbs which were familiar to Xu Qing. At the same time, his figure was like a fish in water in the jungle, his movements incomparably agile.However, he also gradually discovered some special places.In this jungle, many trees had collapsed, and the collapsed areas were mostly connected to the sea.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He arrived at a place where trees had collapsed. Standing there, he first observed his surroundings as well as the locations where the trees had broken and the direction they had fallen in. After that, he lowered his head and swept his gaze across the ground and the broken trees."There are scale fragments on the trees..." Xu Qing picked up a palm-sized grayish-black fragment from the broken wood on the ground. There was a faint fishy smell lingering on it."It's the skin of a sea lizard, and it's been some time." Xu Qing had already made a judgment in his mind. Clearly, the sea lizard had crawled out of the sea and walked toward the jungle. Wherever it passed, trees would be knocked down."There are many such locations. This means that every sea lizard that comes here to shed their skin will take a different path. This is reasonable.""I wonder if the final location chosen by the sea lizards to shed their skin is random or... there's a general area." Xu Qing mumbled and decided to follow the path the sea lizard had taken a long time ago to see what was going on. After making a decision, he sped up while following the traces on the path.However, his vigilance grew increasingly intense.Xu Qing didn't know if there were any cultivators here who had surpassed the Qi Condensation Realm. He had analyzed on the way here that although the sea lizard skin was expensive, Foundation Building cultivators most likely wouldn't fancy it. However, he had no choice but to be wary. After all, many things couldn't be ignored based on a simple judgment.The wind from the forest blew over, bringing with it the smell of rotting vegetation. Xu Qing took a deep breath but didn't smell any other auras. He didn't stop and continued forward.An hour later, when the sky was getting darker, Xu Qing leaped up and squatted on a tree crown near the mountain range. There was a dark glint in his eyes as he stared not far away.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 In front of him, there was a piece of broken sea lizard skin. It was grayish-black and very dry. Clearly, it had been there for a long time, as though it had shattered from fighting.When Xu Qing came, he had checked the information and knew that the sea lizard skin could only be preserved in a special way when it was just shed. Otherwise, once it was shed for too long and its spirituality dissipated, it would have no value.This was also the reason why the competition for the sea lizard skin was bound to be bloody. This was because everyone who came to this island like Xu Qing had to wait and fight for it the moment the sea lizard skin shed.Xu Qing left the tree crown, expanding the scope of his exploration in the surroundings.This lasted until he scouted the surroundings of the mountain range and followed the mountain range for a distance. He saw many sea lizard skins. At the same time, he discovered that the places where the sea lizards shed their skin were mostly near the mountain range. Moreover, it was obvious that the higher the mountain range, the greater the number of broken skins.All of this gave him an answer."The molting of sea lizards is done in a specific area and they yearn for higher places?"Xu Qing lifted his head and looked at the tallest mountain among the several mountains on the Sea Lizard Island. His gaze then turned sharp."That place should be the true treasure land on this island. Only the powerful sea lizards would be able to head there. Their skins are the most valuable!"Xu Qing no longer hesitated and headed toward the highest mountain peak at full speed. He didn't stop at all on the way. As he nimbly shuttled through, he also noticed the figures of cultivators waiting on other mountain peaks.These people were basically rogue cultivators. Their cultivation levels were around the fifth level of Qi Condensation. Although they weren't very strong, the ruthlessness in their eyes was clearly visible.They clearly knew their limits and chose the shorter mountain ranges. All of them stared warily at Xu Qing's arrival and only heaved a sigh of relief when they noticed that he was only passing by.Xu Qing also heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that with so many low-level cultivators gathered here, it meant that his previous judgment shouldn't be wrong. The chances of Foundation Building existence here weren't very high.However, he didn't let his guard down. This was because if there was really a Foundation Building cultivator, there was a high chance that they would be at the place he was going to now.Just like that, not long later, with Xu Qing's speed, he traversed through many mountains and finally arrived at the tallest mountain on Sea Lizard Island. As he arrived, strands of qi instantly erupted from the mountain peak and locked onto him.

Chapter 145 Demon Lands On The Island (2)
Xu Qing stopped in his tracks. After sensing carefully, his expression was a little strange. He still didn't discover the aura of a Foundation Building cultivator.Hence, he walked forward with a calm expression. At the same time, he noticed a large number of broken sea lizard skins on this mountain peak.The auras emitted by these sea lizards' skins were at least at the fifth or sixth level of Qi Condensation. This allowed Xu Qing to confirm his judgment. When sea lizards shed their skin, they indeed moved toward higher places.As for the auras that were probing him, Xu Qing didn't bother with them. He headed straight for the top of the mountain and soon arrived at his destination.At the top of the mountain was a huge basin surrounded by trees. Many cultivators were scattered around. Their cultivation levels were clearly much stronger than the cultivators from the other mountain peaks. Most of them were at the eighth or ninth level of Qi Condensation and there were even a few who were at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm.There indeed wasn't a Foundation Building cultivator!As for the cultivators here, their gazes were either savage or cold and filled with bloodthirst. They were clearly fugitives.Moreover, the human race wasn't the majority here. On the contrary, the nonhuman races occupied the majority. Among them, there were lone wolves and those who moved in groups.There were also some who clearly smelled strongly of the sea. Clearly, they were pirates who were at sea all year round.They were all staring at Xu Qing.When Xu Qing walked over, his gaze swept past them and he immediately recognized three to five people on the wanted list. A strange glint appeared in his eyes.However, he didn't attack. Instead, he found a large tree and sat on it to rest.Although he had some guesses about the fact that there were no Foundation Building cultivators here, Xu Qing still felt that if there wasn't even a Foundation Building cultivator, the reason might not be what he thought.Xu Qing pondered. At the same time, he retracted his gaze from his surroundings. He wasn't unfamiliar with the malice of the cultivators. Regardless of whether it was the slums or the scavenger campsite, it was all similar.He sat there calmly and was about to cultivate when he frowned slightly. He coldly looked at the few pirates who were still looking over.These pirates were a small group of eight cultivators. Among them, there were two humans and six nonhumans. The latter had different appearances. Some had tentacles on their bodies, some had three eyes, and one had wings on his back.They looked at Xu Qing with unfriendly gazes that contained vicious intent. The winged nonhuman among them whispered to his companions. After that, Xu Qing saw the three-eyed nonhuman walking toward him."This place doesn't welcome the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes, so you can either scram or stay here as nourishment." The three-eyed nonhuman approached and said sinisterly. At the same time, the spiritual fluctuations of the eighth level of Qi Condensation were released unscrupulously, forming a deterrence.Xu Qing seriously sized up the nonhuman in front of him, wanting to determine if his neck was a vital point. He then looked at the other party's companions not far away. He knew very well that this was a test from this group. If he was easy to bully, he would become their target for plunder.Xu Qing suddenly lifted his right hand and grabbed behind him.A translucent figure that suddenly appeared behind him was grabbed tightly by the neck.Amidst the intense struggle, this translucent figure rapidly became clear, revealing a blue-haired nonhuman with scales all over its face. From its clothes, it was obvious that it was in the same group as this group of pirates.At that moment, terror appeared in the nonhuman's eyes. Just as he was about to counterattack, Xu Qing ruthlessly clenched his right hand. The nonhuman's neck shattered audibly.  n0vel online free at 𝓷0𝓿𝓮𝓵𝓫𝓲𝓷 This wasn't the end. The power of the Sea Transformation Art gushed in and in the blink of an eye, the blood in the nonhuman's body was controlled by Xu Qing to directly break through its body, causing the nonhuman's body to collapse and explode.A pile of flesh and blood scattered on the ground but none of them tainted Xu Qing's clothes.The organs of the nonhuman races were different from humans. Xu Qing didn't want to waste time identifying the vital parts. If he completely destroyed them, they would still be dead.Xu Qing's gaze didn't fluctuate at all when killing the nonhuman. It was as though he was simply crushing an ant to death. He continued to coldly stare at the three-eyed nonhuman in front of him.The three-eyed nonhuman's body trembled slightly and his breathing was clearly hurried. The expressions of his companions behind him also changed one after another. All of them were incomparably vigilant and solemn. "Misunderstanding." The three-eyed nonhuman took a deep breath and sensed that Xu Qing wasn't someone to be trifled with. He spoke in a low voice and slowly retreated.However, he didn't know Xu Qing and didn't know that Xu Qing's principle was to do his best to kill any existence that threatened his life. Hence, the instant the three-eyed nonhuman retreated, Xu Qing moved.His speed erupted, and his entire person transformed into an afterimage. The instant the three-eyed nonhuman's expression changed drastically and he waved his hand to form a spirit energy defense, Xu Qing had already closed in and punched out.Amidst the rumbling, the three-eyed nonhuman's spirit energy defense directly shattered into pieces. The eyes of the three-eyed nonhuman narrowed to the extreme and he was about to speak when Xu Qing's fist smashed into his chest like a hot knife through butter.The three-eyed nonhuman's body trembled intensely as his chest caved in. All the organs in his body directly collapsed.The expressions of the pirates not far away changed drastically. All of them stood up with low shouts and were about to attack. However, Xu Qing's speed was even faster than them. In reality, when he killed the first pirate, he had already decided to eliminate this group of pirates completely.Xu Qing's speed was astonishing. Under the gazes of the many rogue cultivators and nonhuman races in the surroundings, he charged into the group of pirates almost instantly. Miserable cries and the sounds of spells colliding instantly rang out.In the blink of an eye, six pirates were killed or injured. The expression of the remaining winged nonhuman was filled with unprecedented horror. He soared into the air and was about to escape. However, at the next moment, a sharp dagger whistled over and pierced between his brows, causing his body to fall from the air.It was over.Gasps rang out in the surroundings. At this moment, the surrounding cultivators' gazes became extremely solemn. All of them looked at the expressionless Xu Qing, who was walking beside the pirates' corpses, with fear.Xu Qing ignored the gazes from the surroundings and used his dagger to cut off the heads of the pirates' corpses one by one. He then walked all the way to his resting place and hung the pirates' heads on the tree as a sign.After doing all this, Xu Qing sat down cross-legged and looked at the other end of the basin. There was a large boulder there. Behind the boulder, a gigantic snake head was revealed, as well as a familiar figure under the snake head. "He's here too!" Xu Qing was vigilant. He knew that the other party was strange. He narrowed his eyes and glanced at the huge snake behind the other party.This figure was none other than the old man from the inn on Panquan Road. When he saw Xu Qing at this moment, he felt depressed."Why is this kid here too!"The two of them looked at each other across the basin but quickly retracted their gazes."Unlucky." The old man said in a low voice, but the eyes of the large snake clearly lit up."Gurgle, gurgle.""Why are you greeting him? He doesn't understand your gurgle." The old man glared at the snake angrily."Gurgle, gurgle.""What? You want to ask him if he likes snakes or if he likes to eat snake gallbladders? Are you crazy? Is there a need to ask? Didn't you notice just now? He glanced at your gallbladder again.""Gurgle!""You don't believe me?" The old man was speechless."Gurgle.""I won't help you ask. Didn't you secretly register to join the Seventh Peak's Intelligence Department behind my back? Go back and check how many snakes this kid killed."The old man couldn't be bothered with the huge snake beside him. He felt that ever since this snake saw that kid, Xu Qing, it seemed to have been possessed and its brain was damaged."Keep on insisting that he was looking at your figure. Hehe."

Chapter 146 Don't Provoke Me
Xu Qing sat cross-legged on the tree crown and glanced at the location of the old man from Panquan Road. He was extremely vigilant.At the same time, killing intent flashed in his heart. The other party was someone who was listed on his bamboo slip. It was just that Xu Qing had not been too confident of his success, so he didn't go to Panquan Road.Now that he encountered him again… Xu Qing narrowed his eyes.However, considering the gains were more important this time around and that the other party wouldn't be killed so easily, he suppressed his killing intent and looked around.Every single one of the people here was extraordinary, especially among the lone wolves. A few of them even made Xu Qing feel a little threatened. This was also the reason why he wanted to kill the pirates who provoked him immediately.Growing up in the slums, he deeply understood that there were pros and cons to hiding one's abilities. Many times, hiding something might cause unnecessary trouble.Hence, acting decisively and using the bloody baleful aura to intimidate everyone was what Xu Qing had thought after he arrived. It was also what he had done when he was struggling in the slums.When the time was right, he had to reveal his fangs to warn everyone.Don't provoke me!The reason why he cut off their heads was partly to intimidate and partly because… their heads were valuable.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and flicked his right hand lightly. Immediately, poison powder scattered around him.After doing this, he closed his eyes and silently meditated, waiting for the sea lizard to arrive.Xu Qing indeed achieved his goal. Everyone in the surroundings was extremely wary of him. While they acknowledged his qualifications to come here, they were also vigilant. This caused the situation to return to equilibrium.Just like that, amidst this wonderful balance, time slowly flowed by. A night passed. The next day, when the first rays of dawn scattered down, Xu Qing suddenly opened his eyes and looked down the mountain.Almost at the same time he looked over, seven to eight gazes also looked over at the same time. There was a rumbling sound coming from the foot of the mountain, as though there was a colossus moving forward with great difficulty. This sound also attracted the attention of more cultivators, and a murderous intent rapidly spread out.Very soon, in Xu Qing's eyes, a lizard that was 70 to 80 feet long revealed its figure in the mountain jungle.This lizard's entire body was black, and its bark-like skin revealed traces of age. Under the sunlight, the skin reflected a black glow, and there seemed to be a gap between it and the body as it was being removed bit by bit.Its four claws were even sharper. At this moment, it was crawling over while panting. It was as though every step it took would bring some pain, but it didn't stop at all.Although its aura was weak, the fluctuations from its body that were comparable to the eighth level of Qi Condensation still caused everyone's breathing to freeze slightly. It was impossible for the sea lizard not to sense that there was someone here, but it didn't care at all.As it crawled toward the top of the mountain with great difficulty, the rumbling behind it didn't stop. One could see trees collapsing one after another. The second, third, fourth…A total of six sea lizards appeared one after another."Six pieces of eighth level Qi Condensation sea lizard skin!" Xu Qing's breathing hastened slightly. He was very clear that the selling price of this skin in the Seven Blood Eyes' port was as high as 500 to 600 spirit stones.At that moment, he looked at these lizards with a sharp glint in his eyes. It was as though he wasn't looking at mutated beasts but spirit stones.However, no one, including Xu Qing, acted rashly.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  When the rumbling sounds got closer and closer, the six sea lizards gradually climbed to the top of the mountain with great difficulty. When they arrived at the basin where everyone was at, they ignored all the cultivators in the surroundings and stepped into the basin under the gaze of everyone.After these six sea lizards stepped into the basin, all of them immediately let out roars. Their bodies trembled intensely, as though they were using all their strength to shed their skin.Their roars echoed in all directions, causing the hearts of all the cultivators who were paying attention to them to tremble.The light in Xu Qing's eyes grew sharper and sharper. He saw that these sea lizards were struggling at this moment. Their skins, which already had a different degree of gap from their bodies, were rapidly detaching.The entire process lasted for an hour.The first sea lizard successfully shed its skin and recovered its aura before leaving. From the start to the end, it didn't even glance at the surrounding cultivators.The molt of the lizard that was left in the basin was no longer black but emitted a green light. The patterns on it were clearly visible and even had a hint of translucence. It seemed to be shining with treasure light and looked like a sea lizard of the same size.However, no one made a move.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and didn't move either.He waited for a moment until the second, third, and fourth sea lizards finished molting and left one after another. The moment the last sea lizard shed its skin, someone moved.The person who made a move was none other than the old man from Panquan Road. His speed was so fast that he was like an arrow that had left the bow, heading straight for the basin.The other cultivators in the surroundings also rushed out. Their killing intent erupted explosively at this moment.Xu Qing's body also swayed, leaving behind an afterimage on the tree crown. His speed was astonishing that it created whistling noise as he rushed into the basin.In an instant, more than 30 cultivators entered the basin. Their target was none other than the six sets of lizard skins. In the blink of an eye, they began to mercilessly fight and kill each other.Rumbling sounds echoed through the sky. Xu Qing's entire person was like a sword that had left its sheath, revealing its sharpness. After he got close, he directly grabbed at a lizard skin. Beside him, a nonhuman race cultivator in a straw rain cape had a cold glint in his eyes as he blocked him."Scram!" As he spoke, the nonhuman waved his hand. Immediately, a wave of spirit energy at the ninth level of Qi Condensation spread out from his body, forming a pressure that headed toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing was expressionless and didn't even turn his gaze. He clenched his left hand into a fist, directly punching out at the nonhuman. The instant he punched out, the qi and blood in his body erupted with a bang, revealing the Ba shadow behind him. A malevolent intent spread in all directions and soundless roars rang out as Xu Qing's punch blasted toward the enemy.The expression of the nonhuman changed drastically. Previously, he had already determined that the cultivation base of this Seven Blood Eyes disciple in front of him was extraordinary. However, now that the latter had attacked, his heart skipped a beat the instant he saw the Ba shadow."Blood Qi turning into shadow, your body refinement has reached the perfected realm!"He resolutely retreated. However, it was still too late. As Xu Qing's fist landed, a rumbling sound rang out. The body of the nonhuman in the straw rain cape trembled violently and fresh blood spurted out.However, he wasn't ordinary either. It was unknown what method he used but his body blurred and he appeared in the distance in the next instant. He spat out another mouthful of blood and half of his straw rain cape collapsed, revealing his blue skin. When he lifted his head, he looked at Xu Qing with unprecedented fear in his eyes.Xu Qing didn't have the time to care about the other party. At that moment, he grabbed the lizard skin in front of him and was about to snatch the second set. However, just as he was about to get it, a low roar rang out from afar."You want to kill us?!"Xu Qing abruptly turned his head, and saw a rogue cultivator in the distance who was not able to reach the basin in time and had focused his attention on the last sea lizard that was about to leave.However, he was stopped angrily by a burly nonhuman whose nose was as long as an elephant's."You damn fellow, do you know that once a sea lizard dies here, we'll all die?"The burly dude was filled with anger and blasted the rogue cultivator away. At this moment, the surrounding people also looked at the rogue cultivator with intense killing intent in their eyes.The rogue cultivator's expression changed and he quickly spoke as he retreated."Isn't it just a sea lizard? How could it cause our deaths?!""Are you new here? Do you know why there are no Foundation Building cultivators here and why no Foundation Building cultivators dare to pass by the nearby sea area? Do you really think that we're just standing on an island? Let me tell you, this island is just a small protruding part on the back of a huge sea lizard!" The elephant-nosed nonhuman's eyes were filled with killing intent."Why are there so many sea lizards here? It's because they are all the descendants of this giant sea lizard. In order to protect its descendants, it doesn't allow any foreign cultivators above the Qi Condensation Realm to appear in the surroundings. It doesn't allow any cultivators here to attack the sea lizards. You're on its body now and you want to kill its descendants? Have you lived enough? If it's angered, we'll all die!!""As for us Qi Condensation cultivators, the only reason we can arrive is because such existences don't care about us!"As he spoke, the elephant-nosed nonhuman had already attacked. There were also other rogue cultivators who didn't manage to snatch the sea lizard skins. Their gazes were filled with greed as they attacked together.In an instant, a blood-curdling scream rang out. The rogue cultivator died miserably under the siege and all the items on his body were instantly divided up by everyone.After Xu Qing heard their words, he took a deep breath and finally understood why he didn't see any Foundation Building cultivators on his way here. He lowered his head and looked at the ground. He then silently rushed out and headed straight for the group of cultivators fighting for the lizard skins.A cold light flashed as he took out the dagger. He would instantly kill anyone who obstructed him. The cold wind blew and lifted Xu Qing's hair, revealing the sharpness in his eyes.In the end, he snatched the second lizard skin from three cultivators. By that time, the other four skins also found their owners. Moreover, each of them was incomparably bloody. They had gained a foothold from the slaughter and intimidated others.Among them, the one who obtained two sets like Xu Qing was the old man from Panquan Road. As for the other two sets, one was snatched away by a lone nonhuman and the other was obtained by a group of five people.Killing intent permeated the air, but they restrained themselves from continuing to attack.Xu Qing swept his gaze across the surroundings and exchanged glances with the old man from Panquan Road. He then noticed the large snake behind the other party.When the giant snake saw Xu Qing's gaze, it hurriedly nodded at him.Xu Qing didn't care. His gaze dissipated at the first contact and he gave up on attacking. He suddenly retreated and returned to the tree crown, sitting cross-legged.The other three parties clearly heaved a sigh of relief and retreated.The surroundings of the basin slowly returned to calm. However, one could faintly see numerous unfriendly gazes sweeping past Xu Qing and the others from the eyes of those cultivators who didn't manage to snatch the lizard skins.The old man was resting behind the boulder. He picked up the pipe and took a puff, looking very satisfied. However, he quickly thought of something and hurriedly rummaged through his pocket to take out an antidote before swallowing it.He ignored the gurgling sounds at the side.Only after the large snake knocked into his body did the old man speak in an impatient low voice."Remind my ass. That's a wolf who eats people and kills without batting an eyelid. Does he need me to remind him? You think he doesn't know that someone will attack at night?""I say, you white-eyed snake, why are you so concerned about him? Sigh, I've treated you so well and raised you. Why aren't you concerned about me, an old bag of bones? I think I should have been poisoned just now."While the old man was feeling dissatisfied, Xu Qing, who was on the treetop in the distance, slowly narrowed his eyes. There was a cold glint in them as he sized up those people with unfriendly gazes. His focus was on the pockets on their bodies.He licked his lips and scattered more poison powder to the surroundings.The day slowly passed.Night fell.The pale moonlight shone on the ground. Under the illumination of the moonlight, the desolate bushes produced countless mysterious shadows that swayed in the wind. From afar, they looked like demons, ghosts, and monsters dancing under the eerie moonlight.The cold night slowly couldn't hide the killing intent that permeated the air.The dim moonlight gradually couldn't contain the greed of all living beings.Hence, the desolate sea breeze started the funeral song in advance.

Chapter 147 Poisonous Night
Dark clouds gradually covered the moon and the surroundings became pitch-black.Even the burial song slowly didn't dare to disturb the scene and hurriedly left the venue. The quiet mountain peak seemed to be tainted by an oppressive aura.This lasted until a mournful wail filled with sharpness tore through the night and the silence.Everyone's hearts skipped a beat.Xu Qing opened his eyes.He saw figures whistling up from all directions. Their target was none other than the cultivators who had obtained the lizard skins during the day. A massacre had erupted.Xu Qing didn't pay attention to the cultivators who were attacking the other three parties who had obtained the lizard molt. He stared at the seven figures rushing toward him.The hazy moonlight couldn't hide the cold glint in Xu Qing's eyes. The dim night couldn't dispel the killing intent in his expression. Almost at the instant these figures arrived, Xu Qing moved.The dark night was a cover for the attackers. However, they didn't know that Xu Qing liked the dark night more than them.Xu Qing's figure disappeared from the tree crown.Among the seven cultivators who arrived at the same time, three of them suddenly trembled the instant they got close. The forehead of one was directly shattered and a black iron stick pierced through with cruelty and coldness.There was also someone who spurted out blood and vaguely saw Xu Qing's figure flashing past him.The third person was the most miserable. This was a bloated nonhuman. The instant he got close to the tree crown, a sharp dagger actually stretched out from behind him and ruthlessly slit his neck.The force was so great that its head was separated and blood spurted out like a fountain.It was only at this moment that an ear-piercing scream rang out from the other two.After neatly killing three of them, Xu Qing suddenly retreated and collided with the fourth figure who was casting a spell. This person was a human cultivator. As a rumbling sound rang out, his chest caved in and he fell to the ground with blood gushing out.The remaining three cultivators gasped in horror."You guys cast your spells, I'll hold him back!"  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  A low roar rang out from one of the nonhuman members. This nonhuman was short, like a five-year-old child. However, at this moment, his body suddenly swelled up as he took a step forward. He directly grew to more than ten feet tall and charged toward Xu Qing with a furious roar.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He didn't care about the giant nonhuman who was approaching him or the two nonhuman cultivators who were performing hand seals behind him. Instead, he raised his right hand and clenched.Immediately, the surroundings buzzed. Drops of dew suddenly rose from the vegetation in all directions, instantly gathering into threads that formed a ring-shaped water net.Under the moonlight, the water threads gleamed coldly. As they enveloped the three cultivators, they suddenly shrank with Xu Qing as the center.Whooshing sounds instantly rang out and the expressions of the two cultivators who were casting the spell changed drastically. When their bodies were touched by the water net, their spirit energy defense couldn't resist at all and directly shattered. After their bodies were rapidly penetrated by the water net, they were cut into pieces and turned into minced meat. As for the giant nonhuman cultivator who was rushing toward Xu Qing, his face was pale and his eyes revealed horror. Just as he was about to speak, his entire body turned black and green at the next moment. He clutched his throat and staggered to the ground, twitching a few times before he died.The water net covered him and dismembered him. At the same time, it also dismembered the corpses in the surroundings.Among them, the bloated nonhuman whose throat had been slit was clearly dead, but he let out a mournful cry as he was dismembered. An existence like an imp flew out of his body. Clearly, nonhuman races had too many life-saving methods that outsiders didn't know about.He used some unknown method and his body became slender. He quickly crawled out of the water net and was about to escape.Xu Qing didn't chase after him. He stared coldly and counted inwardly."One, two, three…"At the next instant, this imp-like cultivator's body trembled intensely and he abruptly turned his head to look at Xu Qing."Spare me…"He only had time to say these two words before his body began to melt. The first to dissolve was his tongue.Even though he had lost his tongue, the intense pain still caused him to let out mournful cries that pierced the surroundings and even suppressed the sounds of battle from the other three parties.This attracted the attention of everyone present.They watched with their own eyes as the small black person screamed and rolled on the ground in pain. In the end, its body melted alive and turned into blood. It couldn't say anything else even until its death.Gasps rang out from all directions before quickly retracting. Almost everyone took out antidotes immediately and ate them.Only the old man from the inn was very calm.In reality, when Xu Qing arrived yesterday, he had already started taking antidotes. After all, he had experienced Xu Qing's poison before.Xu Qing didn't care about the actions of the surrounding cultivators. He calmly kept the dagger and black iron stick and picked up the leather pouches of these people one by one. Finally, he returned to the top of the tree and sat cross-legged, closing his eyes to cultivate.Perhaps it was because this island was on the back of the terrifying giant sea lizard, so the spirit energy and anomalous substances were very dense.To other cultivators, since they could be active at sea for a long time, they were naturally used to such an environment. They had their own cultivation methods that could separate the anomalous substances. However, they often had to go ashore to use medicinal pills or other methods to expel part of the anomalous substances they absorbed after going out for a period of time.However, to Xu Qing, he didn't have such a need, so he didn't have any worries when cultivating. Moreover, the aura of the Forbidden Sea here was also helpful to his cultivation of the Sea Transformation Art.Although Xu Qing, who was cultivating, had his eyes closed, no one in the surroundings dared to have any designs on him. Most of them stayed far away from him, afraid that they would be poisoned.The exchange of blows between them was also clearly affected, and the battle gradually ended. Just like this, a night passed.In the sky, Dawn bit through Night's lips, leaving a bloody stain in the sky. This blood stain slowly flowed and grew fainter until it spread through the entire sky.Around the mountain basin, the lone nonhuman who had snatched the lizard skin yesterday was still there. There was also another one beside him. It seemed that they had reached some agreement.The additional person was none other than the cultivator in the straw rain cape who fought with Xu Qing yesterday.As for the other side, the group of five cultivators clearly weren't able to keep the lizard skin and were turned into corpses. They were replaced by seven to eight people led by the elephant-nosed burly nonhuman.Only Xu Qing and the old man from Panquan Road were still the same.However, the difference was that Xu Qing's surroundings were covered in minced meat, and the latter… did not have even a corpse in his surroundings.Xu Qing glanced at the large snake beside the old man. After the other party sensed him, it immediately looked at him and nodded repeatedly, as though it was greeting him.Xu Qing felt that it was a little strange but he didn't think too much about it. He retracted his gaze and continued to meditate with his eyes closed.Behind the boulder where the old man from Panquan Road was, he kicked the large snake beside him and snorted."Did you see that? He is ignoring you, so don't keep thinking about that kid. I'm your only family in this world.""Gurgle, gurgle."The large snake felt a little aggrieved. It stared eagerly at Xu Qing in the distance, and its expression gradually became listless. The old man saw this scene and sighed."Why are you crying again? You, sigh, that brat doesn't understand snake language, so he ignored you…" After saying that, the old man felt some regret, and the snake's eyes instantly lit up again."When a girl grows, she can't be kept. Even a silly snake can't be kept."The old man was helpless. He wondered if he should find an opportunity to kill Xu Qing here. However, when he thought of the other party's ruthlessness, he still dispelled this thought.Just like that, ten days passed slowly.In these ten days, some of the cultivators on the mountain peak left while others arrived. When there were a lot of people, there were over a hundred cultivators in the surroundings of the basin, and when there were few, there were dozens .Some were lone wolves, some were pirates, and some were nonhumans from other islands. Battles and slaughters continued to occur.During this time, the sea lizards appeared three times. Each time, it was a massacre. Xu Qing's attacks were ruthless and decisive. Not only did he snatch some sea lizard skins, but he also piled up everyone he killed around the tree.From afar, the large tree seemed to be dyed red with blood. It was a shocking sight.As the intimidation continued to accumulate, the place Xu Qing was in was already a forbidden zone to others.There were also a few like Xu Qing. Regardless of whether it was the old man from Panquan Road, the cultivator in the straw rain cape and his companion, or the elephant-nosed burly nonhuman, they all kept their gains and didn't choose to leave. It was as though they were waiting for something.Xu Qing also sensed this. Hence, he didn't leave but cultivated silently in these ten days.The spirit energy here was vigorous and the anomalous substances were dense. And this environment where he had to be in a highly focused state made him feel as though he had returned to the jungle in the forbidden zone. His cultivation speed clearly increased by a lot.Right now, he wasn't far from the ninth level of the Sea Transformation Art."I should be able to break through in three days at most."Xu Qing mumbled and continued to cultivate. Traces of spirit energy gushed in from all directions and entered his body. While nourishing his entire body, it also fused the anomalous substances into his shadow, causing the 870-foot-high spirit sea in his body to continue expanding.880 feet, 890 feet…Two days passed. When the third day arrived, at noon, the spirit sea fluctuations in Xu Qing's body were already infinitely close to 900 feet. Once it reached 900 feet, it meant that his Sea Transformation Art had stepped into the ninth level.Disciples who cultivated this Seven Blood Eyes cultivation art to the ninth level could basically sweep through most of the same realm opponents from the human sects in the Nanhuang Continent. They might even be able to fight Foundation Building cultivators from small sects with inferior cultivation arts.Needless to say, Xu Qing's body refinement from the Mountains and Seas Art had also reached an unprecedented level, forming the terrifying Ba shadow. It could be said that once he broke through to the Sea Transformation Art, Xu Qing's combat strength would erupt once again.At that time, he would be an existence that surpassed the peak of Qi Condensation. He could completely be considered a Foundation Building expert. For example, Xu Qing was confident that he could suppress the Diamond Sect's ancestor regardless of whether it was on the sea or land. As for killing him, he would definitely be able to do it with some effort."I can break through tonight!" Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. Just as he was about to continue cultivating, dense footsteps and whistling sounds suddenly rang out from the foot of the mountain.Before the people arrived, waves of cold and savage intent spread out, enveloping the entire basin. This caused the expressions of everyone here to change as they looked down the mountain.The ones who came… weren't sea lizards but a group of cultivators!A group of malevolent figures in disheveled clothes, shockingly savage and filled with extreme killing intent.There were a total of 16 of them, and every one of them emitted powerful cultivation fluctuations. The intensity of the murderous aura on each of them was astonishing."Sea Ghost!""It's the Sea Ghost Organization!""Damn it, why are they here!!"Exclamations immediately rang out in the surroundings.

Chapter 148 Xu Qing's Laws
A dark glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes.He wasn't unfamiliar with this Sea Ghost Organization.When he was in the Seven Blood Eyes, he lacked spirit stones and had killed many wanted criminals. Among them was Sun Dewang from the Sea Ghost Organization.The other party had lost completely in Zhao Zhongheng's gambling den, causing Xu Qing to have no gains other than the bounty on his head after killing him.It was also at that time that Xu Qing knew that there were a large number of pirate organizations on the Forbidden Sea. They were mostly made up of people who were expelled from the various sects, islands, and races.Most of them had no choice but to join the pirate organizations and were active on the Forbidden Sea.There were many large pirate organizations, and one of them was Sea Ghost.The dozen or so figures walking over from the foot of the mountain emitted the same cultivation fluctuations as Sun Dewang. There were even four among them who clearly emitted stronger fluctuations.The feeling Xu Qing got was that they were at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm.Moreover, since they were all people who lived on the edge of a knife, their murderous aura was very intense, much more intense than the people Xu Qing had seen in the scavenger campsite.Xu Qing stared at the 16 figures of the Sea Ghost Organization. He watched as they rapidly approached. When they reached the basin, a sense of intimidation spread out from all the surrounding cultivators.Clearly, the reputation and strength of the Sea Ghost Organization caused everyone to instinctively feel a sense of rejection.However, these cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization didn't seem to care about the cultivators here at all. Most of their expressions were cold and sinister, and there were even some who couldn't be bothered to hide their malice.They even swept their gazes over Xu Qing and the old man from Panquan Road coldly.It was as though no one here was worthy of their attention.However, they didn't attack immediately. Instead, they found an area and sat down. One of them raised his head and coldly looked around before speaking slowly."You guys can scram now. If you don't, then from now on, you can only watch and not fight for the sea lizard skins. Otherwise… you'll die."His voice was filled with dense killing intent that spread in all directions. Everyone fell silent.This scene caused Xu Qing to fall into deep thought. He had already made some guesses from the behaviors of the others. Now that he combined it with the Sea Ghost that had arrived, he realized that something special was going to happen on Sea Lizard Island."Should I leave first?"Xu Qing fell silent. After sensing the cultivation fluctuations in his body, he made the decision. He directly stood up and left.His speed was so fast that he almost instantly arrived in the distance.His departure caused the surrounding cultivators to cast sidelong glances at him. The old man from Panquan Road was even more surprised."Did this kid really leave?"Many cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization also glanced at Xu Qing's back but didn't mind.Just like that, Xu Qing descended the mountain at full speed and stepped into the jungle without stopping at all. An hour later, his figure appeared on the beach.With a wave of his hand, the magic boat appeared and fell into the sea. He leaped up and stepped on the magic boat.The instant he landed on the magic boat, Xu Qing took a deep breath and sat down cross-legged. His hands formed a seal and the magic boat's protective barrier was activated. As the sea surface churned, the plesiosaur formed by his spell also swam at the bottom of the sea and was on guard.Xu Qing then glanced at the Sea Lizard Island. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes.His vigilance and wit didn't decrease because of the smooth harvest on the island, nor did it weaken because of the increase in his cultivation base and strength. His personality was as usual.Therefore, when he was about to break through, he didn't arrogantly choose to stay on the island to advance.There was a high chance that it was safe to do that and he had a lot of poison powder that could give a miserable death to those who got close to him. Moreover, he himself was very strong.However, there was no need for that.He had seen some similar things in the slums. There were too many examples of people giving opportunities to their enemies because of their momentary arrogance and negligence.Similar to how he wanted to destroy everything that threatened his life, Xu Qing wouldn't create an opportunity for others to attack him.This was the law of survival in this chaotic world.Some people would slowly forget this point because of their strength. However, Xu Qing's experiences since he was young were engraved in his bones, so he wouldn't.Now that he was in a safe environment, Xu Qing closed his eyes and his cultivation base erupted as he began to break through.At the same time, beside the basin at the top of the mountain on Sea Lizard Island, as Xu Qing left, the poison here decreased a little. This caused many cultivators to heave a sigh of relief in their hearts.However, the words of the Sea Ghost Organization when they arrived became a strong threat, causing all the rogue cultivators here to feel stifled. However, they didn't seem to be willing to leave and were hesitating to make a choice.There were also some who chose to leave after some hesitation.Very soon, dusk arrived.The instant the sunset descended, fog slowly appeared between the sea and the sky in the distance.This fog was thin and permeated the surroundings. It was as though an invisible god was breathing. It lingered above the Forbidden Sea and rolled in all directions.Fog wasn't rare in the Forbidden Sea, so even if someone saw it, they wouldn't pay too much attention to it. It was only when an astonishing fluctuation suddenly spread out from the surface of the sea in the direction of the shore that many cultivators quickly looked over.The instant they looked into the distance, the spirit energy on the shore emitted even stronger fluctuations.Endless spirit energy churned in all directions at this instant and surged toward a magic boat on the surface of the sea.The range was so large that it covered a total of 600 feet in the blink of an eye. Moreover, it continued to expand and instantly reached 890 feet. This wasn't the end. Due to the sudden influx of spirit energy, a huge vortex formed on the sea with Xu Qing's magic boat as the center.The vortex rumbled and the seawater churned like a lantern in the dark night, attracting the attention of everyone on the many mountain peaks on Sea Lizard Island.Numerous gazes gathered over, and the sound of sharp inhaling could be heard from every mountain."Someone actually broke through here?""The feeling of breaking through… is a little strong!"As for the cultivators at the basin, regardless of whether they were rogue cultivators or the Sea Ghost members, they were all shocked at this moment. They stared at the vortex on the distant sea and their hearts trembled."It's that Seven Blood Eyes' disciple who left earlier!""He actually broke through!" p1ease visi(t) nove1B(in).ne)t  Xu Qing couldn't hear the discussions of the cultivators. At that moment, his entire body was shaking. The spirit sea in his body was the same as the vortex outside, 890 feet high.It was as though there was another world in his body that overlapped with the world outside his body.Under the overlapping, Xu Qing's body trembled even more intensely. His entire body emitted a piercing purple light and his breathing became hurried. As his cultivation base circulated, the instant the spirit sea in his body broke through the last ten feet and reached 900 feet, the vortex in the outside world also expanded abruptly to 900 feet.At this moment, the inner and outer seas synchronized and transformed into rumbling thunder that continuously erupted in Xu Qing's mind.Boom boom boom! He broke through to the eighth level of the Sea Transformation Art and stepped into the ninth level!It wasn't over yet!Under this eruption, the spirit sea vortex in his surroundings expanded again. 910 feet, 920 feet, 930 feet…The expansion of the spirit sea vortex outside guided the spirit sea in his body to expand as well.This scene was something Xu Qing hadn't encountered when he was cultivating previously. This was because his current breakthrough was in the Forbidden Sea. It was different from when he cultivated on land before. The spirit energy here was even denser.The range was still expanding.940 feet, 950 feet, 960 feet…When the vortex in the outside world reached a range of 970 feet, the spirit sea in Xu Qing's body also erupted and synchronized to a range of 970 feet. In an instant, the fluctuations of the ninth level of Qi Condensation completely erupted from his body.The surface of the sea within 970 feet of him was affected and instantly churned, rising high into the air.It was a shocking sight.Xu Qing's eyes suddenly opened.The purple light continued to linger in his pupils for a few breaths. Just when it was about to dim, an even stronger fluctuation emitted from Xu Qing's body once again.The shadow of the Ba appeared behind him, and it roared at the sky like a malicious ghost with violence and cruelty, causing the nearly 1000-foot-long surface of the sea that was churning intensely to show signs of burning.It turned into a sea of fire.When this roar spread in all directions, the Ba shadow behind Xu Qing sucked forcefully like a whale swallowing. Immediately, the 970-foot-long vortex of fire headed straight for the Ba shadow's mouth.It instantly swallowed them all.As it swallowed the vortex of fire, the Ba shadow trembled intensely. Under its dry and cracked skin, a red glow flickered and continued to deepen. It was as though it was filled with magma.Finally, the light spread out, forming a dazzling light that enveloped the surroundings. At the same time, a dense fire power also rose from Xu Qing's body!This wasn't a strange transformation of water into fire. This was a bizarre fusion of water and fire because within the flames, there was also a stream of water formed by the aura of the Forbidden Sea!It was only at this moment that Xu Qing's breakthrough was truly completed.The purple light in his eyes disappeared and he slowly stood up, standing on the magic boat. The strength of his aura and the sharpness of his gaze caused the hearts of everyone who saw it to tremble fiercely.This was especially so for the cultivators around the mountain peak basin. All of them were panting as though they were facing a great enemy.Xu Qing's breakthrough was too astonishing and this gave them immense pressure. The shock was even greater for those cultivators who had seen Xu Qing make a move earlier.One had to know that Xu Qing was already very powerful to begin with. Now that he had broken through, they could imagine that with such an existence, everyone's harvest this time around would probably be very little.The old man from Panquan Road also widened his eyes. He was stunned for a moment before he suddenly whispered to the large snake beside him."Why don't you go and seduce this kid? I think this kid isn't simple. Why does the ninth level of Qi Condensation give me the feeling that he's even more ferocious than a Foundation Building cultivator!"These cultivators' breathing suddenly paused. This was because… they saw Xu Qing step onto the island again. His speed was faster than before and he transformed into a ray of light, returning once again!Xu Qing had once again appeared outside the basin, carrying with him a fiery aura.He ignored everyone and expressionlessly returned to the tree crown. Just like before, he sat cross-legged.However, this time, his figure attracted the attention of all the cultivators of the Sea Ghost Organization. Their expressions were solemn and there was faint fear in their eyes.Although the manifestation of strength had pros and cons, in the current environment, the pros clearly outweighed the cons.Xu Qing was using his actions to tell the Sea Ghost not to provoke him.Your words about forbidding others from snatching the sea lizard's skin… are ineffective against me.

Chapter 149 Indestructible Alliance
Some words didn't need to be spoken. Actions could represent one's standpoint.Xu Qing sat cross-legged on the tree crown. He was no different from before he left. Regardless of his movements or expression, there was no difference at all. However, the feelings of the cultivators in the surroundings of the basin were already worlds apart from before.Those who were wary of him before became afraid.Those who ignored him before were now paying extreme attention to him.All of this caused the atmosphere around the basin to become increasingly oppressive. It was only late at night when a rumbling sound rang out from the foot of the mountain and two sea lizards comparable to the eighth level of Qi Condensation staggered over that things changed.Their appearance attracted the attention of all the cultivators present. However, even after the sea lizards crawled into the basin and finished molting, no one dared to snatch them. They could only watch as five people from the Sea Ghost Organization entered the basin, as though they wanted to collect the skins.Only Xu Qing was different.Xu Qing opened his eyes. The instant the two sea lizards finished molting, he stood up.His rise immediately attracted the attention of everyone in the surroundings.Xu Qing didn't care about the gazes on him. He calmly leaped down from the tree crown and transformed into an afterimage, heading straight for the basin at an extremely fast speed.Even though there were cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization in the basin, Xu Qing didn't even glance at them. He headed straight for a lizard skin. At that moment, beside this lizard skin, there was a nonhuman cultivator from the Sea Ghost Organization. When he saw Xu Qing approaching, his expression darkened.As his gaze flickered, he suddenly lifted his right hand. Immediately, his fingernails extended rapidly like sharp blades as he swung them fiercely at Xu Qing."Friend, this lizard molt is my Sea…"Before the nonhuman cultivator finished speaking, Xu Qing grabbed the other party's palm. He then abruptly pulled it toward him and his knee ruthlessly smashed into the nonhuman cultivator's chest.The chest of the nonhuman cultivator instantly caved in. Cracks rapidly spread throughout his body and finally, with a boom, he shattered into pieces and collapsed on the ground.However, what collapsed wasn't flesh and blood but wooden blocks.This nonhuman cultivator wasn't a real person but a puppet.The expressions of the cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization in the basin changed one after another. While they were on guard, Xu Qing had already taken away the lizard skin and was coldly looking at them.At that moment, not far away, all the cultivators of the Sea Ghost Organization, who were sitting cross-legged, stood up one after another. While they were afraid, a sense of cruelty also filled the air. p1ease visi(t) nove1B(in).ne)t  Both sides looked at each other for a long time.In the middle of the Sea Ghost Organization was a tall and burly man with a bare upper body. Right now, flesh and blood squirmed on his chest, revealing a sinister face.This face was like a newborn baby. Although it was filled with wrinkles, it was faintly filled with vitality. Its red eyes stared at Xu Qing and suddenly spoke."Friend, you destroyed my toy but this is nothing. This sea lizard… my Sea Ghost wants half of it. It's not too much, right?"Xu Qing glanced at this face but didn't say anything. He then took the lizard skin he had obtained and returned to the tree crown, continuing to meditate.His goal was very clear. He had come to the Sea Lizard Island for the sea lizard skins, not to kill. Of course, if there were any obstructions during the process of obtaining the skin, it would be a different matter.Also, he wasn't overly greedy.Xu Qing was very clear that this current state was actually more beneficial to him. After all, the Sea Ghost had intimidated others, causing other rogue cultivators to not dare to fight for the skins. This way, he would gain more.Although his combat strength was sufficient, these desperadoes who had struggled between life and death definitely had some trump cards. Hence, Xu Qing felt that there was no need to kill.Since his goal could be achieved, he naturally agreed with the other party.Just like that, three days passed.During these three days, Xu Qing directly took away half of the sea lizard skins without any obstructions. However, he still had doubts about the arrival of the Sea Ghost and the reason why the other cultivators hadn't left yet.On the third night, when a huge boat appeared on the distant sea, Xu Qing's suspicion reached a certain height.This boat was a thousand feet in size and completely pitch-black. It was different from the style of the Seven Blood Eyes' magic boat. It was more like the shape of a maple leaf. The most strange thing was that when one's gaze landed on this boat, they couldn't help but feel a chill in their hearts. It was as though there was a strange forbidden zone hidden in this boat.And the reason for all of this was the boat's paint.The pitch-black color wasn't natural but was some kind of blood. It was this blood that gave Xu Qing that eerie feeling."Litu Sect!""They're actually here too!"The location of the basin allowed the people here to see the sea in a more comprehensive manner. At that moment, just like Xu Qing, they all noticed the black boat that was rapidly approaching. Immediately, someone exclaimed in a low voice, their voice filled with deep fear.The over ten cultivators from the Sea Ghost Organization had solemn expressions as well. They chatted in low voices as though they were facing a great enemy.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He wasn't unfamiliar with the Litu Sect.Back then, the little girl at the scavenger campsite had a brother who was the captain of the Litu Sect's law enforcement team. She was taken away by her brother.At that time, outside the general store, he heard some scavengers discussing the Litu Sect. Their words were all expressing the meaning of the other party being a group of lunatics.,m It was only when he entered the Seven Blood Eyes and flipped through the information in the Homicide Department that Xu Qing gained a better understanding of the Litu Sect. The Litu Sect was one of the four largest forces of the human race in the Nanhuang Continent. It was on par with Purple Earth, the Seven Blood Eyes, and the True Words. Its doctrine was to follow the ancient kings and sovereigns and stay away from the Endsoil World.Their doctrine kept proclaiming that the holy lands established by the ancient kings and sovereigns were a paradise. There was no famine, no cold, no killing, and spirit energy was pure.They also proclaimed that the holy lands would open the gate to the Endsoil World and guide all those who believed in them over.This was the faith of the Litu Sect. At the same time, to everyone who didn't agree with this faith, they were all heretical existences in the eyes of the Litu Sect. They would be punished and their right to life would be stripped.And this extreme doctrine naturally brought about a group of lunatics."I wonder how she is now."Xu Qing muttered inwardly. He recalled the piece of candy the little girl had once given him. However, Xu Qing quickly returned from his memories and stared at the Litu Sect's boat that was getting closer and closer."What exactly will happen on this Sea Lizard Island?"Just as Xu Qing's doubts grew deeper and deeper, the old man from Panquan Road, who was behind the boulder in the basin, sighed when he saw that the Litu Sect had arrived."It's over. This time, the Sea Ghost and the Litu Sect came one after another. They should have the same goal as me."The old man slapped his forehead. Just as he was feeling very vexed, the large snake at the side gurgled. The old man glanced at the large snake and pondered for a moment."What you said makes sense."With that, the old man's body swayed and he suddenly stood up, heading straight for the tree where Xu Qing was at. The large snake followed excitedly. However, very few people could recognize this excitement.His movement immediately attracted the attention of the cultivators around the basin.The Sea Ghost cultivators also looked over, but the Litu Sect was about to arrive, so they weren't in the mood to stop him.Very soon, as Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and stared at the other party's neck, the old man brought the large snake to a place 100 feet away from him."Kid, let's discuss this. Don't release poison. Disperse the poison powder here and I'll tell you something."Xu Qing looked at the old man and roughly guessed his motive. He waved his hand, as though he was dissipating the poisonous gas.When the old man saw Xu Qing's actions, he heaved a sigh of relief and stepped into the range of 100 feet.After taking a few steps, he carefully stopped when he was 30 feet away from Xu Qing."Kid, are you wondering why the Sea Ghost and the Litu Sect are here?""I won't waste my breath and will tell you directly. According to the calculations of the seasons, there's a high chance that a Foundation Building sea lizard will shed its skin during this period of time. The value of a Foundation Building sea lizard's skin is astonishing. It's worth 2,000 spirit stones at the early stage, 5,000 spirit stones at the middle stage, and at least 10,000 spirit stones at the late stage.""This old man is alone and weak, so I came to form an indestructible alliance with you. You and I will join forces to snatch the resources and we will give our trust to each other. We'll split the gains 50-50."The old man from Panquan Road spoke passionately and quickly. After he finished speaking, he looked at Xu Qing. However, his expression quickly changed. He hurriedly took out a large number of medicinal pills and swallowed them. He then pointed at Xu Qing and cursed angrily."Brat, didn't you say that you wouldn't release poison!!""I didn't release poison. It permeated this place earlier." Xu Qing pondered over the information in the other party's words and casually explained."F*ck, then why did you wave your hand just now?!" The old man was even angrier."You were the one who made me dissipate the poison gas." Xu Qing frowned."…Then did you dissipate it?" The old man glared."My poison can't be dispelled." Xu Qing felt a little impatient. The other party was someone who was listed on his bamboo slip. If it wasn't for the fact that the forces here were chaotic and it was inconvenient for him to make a move, he would have wanted to kill the other party immediately.The old man was speechless. He looked at Xu Qing and let out a long sigh."I feel that I can't communicate with you! You mean that you can't dissipate the poison but in order to comfort me, you feigned it?"Xu Qing coldly looked at the old man and didn't speak.The veins on the old man's forehead bulged. When the huge snake saw this scene, it hurriedly gurgled.The old man gritted his teeth and swallowed another handful of medicinal pills as he glared at Xu Qing."Alliance, yes or no.""Alright," Xu Qing replied without hesitation.Seeing that Xu Qing agreed so quickly, the old man sighed and was about to speak. However, at that moment, the Litu Sect's boat in the distance had already arrived at the shore.One figure after another walked out of the boat. There were about seven to eight of them and they stepped into the jungle.Under the moonlight, these people's appearances couldn't be seen clearly. One could only see that their robes were black and even their heads were covered. A murderous and bloody aura were being emitted by them. After they stepped into the jungle, they headed straight for the mountain peak where the basin was located."The Litu Sect is filled with lunatics. There have always been rumors on the sea that they secretly control some islands and seem to be conducting some strange research. However, the locations are hidden and until now, very few outsiders have been able to reach them." The old man's expression was ugly as he spoke gloomily.When Xu Qing heard this, he narrowed his eyes and looked over.

Chapter 150 The Bewitching Golden Light (1)
Not long later, the group of people from the Litu Sect walked out of the jungle and arrived at the mountain basin.There were a total of eight of them, and all of them wore black robes embroidered with blood-colored sun. It looked bizarre, but the coldness from their bodies was especially obvious.This was especially so for their eyes that were covered by the robe. They would occasionally reveal cold gazes that had no emotions in them, as though the lives here were meaningless.That sense of indifference to death caused these rogue cultivators and nonhumans in the basin to be on high alert. Even though the Sea Ghost Organization had always been known for their cruelty, all of them were extremely wary now.  Best novel online free at​ 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝𝕓𝕚𝕟  Cruelty was also a part of human nature, but these people from the Litu Sect were simply emotionless killing machines.As they walked over, the cold intent spread out and filled the entire basin. Many rogue cultivators' expressions changed and they ultimately chose to leave.The Litu Sect didn't even glance at the rogue cultivators who had left. After they arrived, they sat down and didn't move at all.Xu Qing's gaze swept past these people from Litu Sect. He didn't see the older brother of the little girl in the scavenger campsite back then, so he retracted his gaze and closed his eyes to meditate.As for the old man from Panquan Road, he didn't return to the boulder. He found a place to avoid the poisonous gas and sat there. He was vigilant against Xu Qing as well as against the other cultivators in the surroundings. At the same time, he was muttering inwardly."This kid agreed so quickly. He is definitely up to no good."Just like that, ten days passed amidst the stifling atmosphere in the basin.In these ten days, no sea lizards came.This phenomenon caused all the cultivators here to have a faint premonition. The waves on the surrounding sea also gradually decreased and became increasingly calm.It was as though a great storm was coming.It was the same for the cultivators around the basin. Everyone was in silence. Only the large snake beside the old man would often look at Xu Qing and make gurgling sounds.Xu Qing didn't understand and didn't bother with it. Instead, he kept himself at his peak state.He had cleaned the dagger and sharpened the iron stick. As for the alliance, he had only casually agreed. Xu Qing wouldn't trust the old man and knew that the old man also wouldn't believe him.The stifling atmosphere changed at dusk on the eleventh day.The sea rumbled. After ten days of peace, the waves seemed to have awakened from their slumber, stirring up violent waves.Waves of terrifying aura surged out of the sea and spread in all directions. When it filled the entire island, Xu Qing saw several vortexes appearing on the surface of the sea in the distance, rapidly approaching the island.Many cultivators noticed this scene and most of them remained silent. However, their cultivation bases were all circulating and they were ready to make a move at any time. Very soon, the first vortex approached the shore. As the seawater rumbled and splashed in all directions, a huge purple-black creature that looked to be 500 feet in length emerged from the surface of the sea and stepped onto the beach.The afterglow shining on it made it look like its body was covered in a layer of treasure armor. This treasure armor emitted a dark light and looked extremely tenacious. At the same time, a pressure that far exceeded Qi Condensation erupted from its body.The aura was so strong that the surrounding sand danced and spread in all directions.It was a Foundation Building sea lizard!Regardless of whether it was the treasure armor on its body, the sharp claws on its limbs, or the vertical pupils of its eyes, they all gave off an endless killing intent.Moreover, it clearly had intelligence. After it got ashore, it shook its body and swept its cold gaze across the island. Finally, it looked at the basin at the top of the tallest mountain. A hint of disdain appeared in its eyes as it strode over. The aura was so strong that all the cultivators on the mountain peaks on the island felt their hearts tremble and their breathing became hurried. Their faces turned pale as though they were being suppressed.And there was more than one Foundation Building sea lizard.After the first sea lizard, as the vortexes got closer and closer, the second Foundation Building sea lizard also landed on the shore and stepped into the jungle.Next was the third sea lizard.As for the third lizard, its aura was even stronger. Its body was a thousand feet long. As it stepped onto the beach, it roared at the sky. Immediately, a storm appeared in the surroundings, sweeping in all directions, causing the trees in the jungle to shake violently.Even the cultivators in the basin could sense the fishy stench from so far away.The suppression of the cultivation base was even more intense now.Even Xu Qing's pupils constricted as he sensed the terror of these three Foundation Building sea lizards.From what he could sense, the first two were already very strong. As for the last one, he felt a faint piercing pain in his eyes just by looking at it.He gasped. His mind quickly compared the Diamond Sect's ancestor to them. The answer after the comparison was that even the first two relatively weaker sea lizards could tear the Diamond Sect's ancestor to pieces."Two mid-stage Foundation Building creatures, and the last one is actually at the late-stage Foundation Building realm! The first two are worth ten thousand spirit stones, and the last one... can be casually sold for 15,000 to 16,000 spirit stones! Xu Qing, let's really form an alliance this time!" The eyes of the old man from Panquan Road shone as he spoke rapidly.The gazes of the cultivators around the basin also shone. Regardless of whether it was the Sea Ghost or the nonhuman races, their greed was stimulated. The temptation of tens of thousands of spirit stones was too great for cultivators like them.Xu Qing's expression was also solemn. He looked at the three Foundation Building sea lizards walking over one after the other and felt an intense sense of danger. All the hairs on his body stood up at this moment and the skin on his body shivered slightly.
