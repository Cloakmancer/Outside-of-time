When he was far away and no one was around, Wu Jianwu's body trembled and his face turned pale. His eyes revealed horror and cold sweat covered his forehead as he let out a long breath."What's going on? Two fires!! This fiend was already so powerful previously but now, he has actually formed two life fires. If this was outside, he would have killed me!!"As his heart trembled, Wu Jianwu kept taking deep breaths. He felt that he shouldn't be leaving the sect for the next few months."Fortunately, I'm smart. I gave him face today and even said I will give spirit stones to him. If he is a reasonable person, he wouldn't persistently chase after me, right?""My head hurts… No, I won't even leave the cave abode until I form the second life fire!"Outside the Knowing Dreams Restaurant, Xu Qing had a strange expression on his face.The mute was stunned and so was Xu Xiaohui.Ling'er blinked and looked a little puzzled. Beside her, the old man was dumbfounded.Those who were nearby saw it clearly earlier. Xu Qing didn't say a word. However, after he assumed a posture like he was about to attack, Wu Jianwu began to speak to himself for some reason.Moreover, he laughed and spoke loudly. It was as though Xu Qing was talking to him through voice transmission and was even inviting him to drink wine.The entire act was performed perfectly. Those who couldn't see this scene outside and could only hear the sounds would definitely think that it was true. They would think that Wu Jianwu was a great man and that he admired Xu Qing. The two of them were like good friends who respected each other.At the same time, they would also have thought that Xu Qing had sent a lot of invitations, but Wu Jianwu indeed didn't have the time, so he was returning the favor by paying the fine for killing a piedmont disciple."Little Jianjian's acting skills are quite bad, even I am speechless."A biting sound rang out, breaking the silence of the private room. The captain stood up from his seat and walked to the window while eating an apple. He then winked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's gaze swept past the captain's limbs and a hint of surprise appeared in his eyes.The captain's recovery was too fast. He got a feeling that the regrowth of the broken limbs wasn't done by cultivation arts or medicinal pills. It felt more like some bizarre spell.The large snake took advantage of the old man's confusion and twisted its body, rushing out. It quickly crawled out of the window and headed straight for Xu Qing.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. However, after noticing the eyes of the large snake, he felt that they were a little familiar, as though he had seen them before. Not only did the other party not have any killing intent, but it was also filled with joy."Gurgle gurgle gurgle."Amidst its joy, the large snake's body rapidly shrunk and finally transformed into a slender snake that directly coiled around Xu Qing's hand. Its entire body turned snow-white and its eyes were very large, looking very cute."Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle.""Gurgle, gurgle."When the old man from Panquan Road saw this scene, he wailed inwardly. Just as he was about to reprimand it, Xu Qing lifted his head and coldly glanced at him.The old man instantly shuddered as he recalled the scene of him almost being killed by Xu Qing. While he was filled with grief and indignation, the feeling of his daughter choosing the former between her crush and her father made his heart ache."No, I can't compromise on this matter. This brat Xu isn't a good person no matter how I look at him. He's definitely not a good match for Ling'er." The old man from Panquan Road took a deep breath. As thoughts raced in his mind, he hurriedly spoke."Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle!"He didn't dare to speak human language and spoke Ling'er's language.He was telling Ling'er that if she wanted to be with Xu Qing forever, she had to transform. If she wanted to transform, she had to reach the Foundation Building realm, so she had to leave now.Ling'er looked at Xu Qing reluctantly and gently rubbed her head against his arm. She then let go of his arm and returned to the old man.The old man heaved a sigh of relief inwardly and was secretly smug. After that, he hurriedly left. From afar, Xu Qing could still hear gurgling sounds."Alright, Deputy Director Xu, stop looking. Come and have a few drinks with me." The captain waved at Xu Qing.Xu Qing thought about it and turned his head to nod at Xu Xiaohui, indicating that she could leave.Xu Xiaohui bit her lower lip and her heart was filled with gratitude. She knelt down in the rain and her forehead touched the ground. After bowing deeply, she stood up and walked into the distance alone.The mute didn't leave. He squatted outside the Knowing Dreams Restaurant, where the skinny youth had died.Xu Qing didn't say much. With a sway of his body, he leaped to the window and sat down after stepping into the private room. Last time, at Zhang San's place, Xu Qing noticed that the captain wasn't in a good state, so he didn't say everything.After he sat down, Xu Qing looked at the captain."Captain, why did the statue's nose explode?" Xu Qing asked seriously.He felt that he had to ask this. Otherwise, with the captain's paranoia, he would definitely not feel at ease. Hence, Xu Qing felt that he should reassure the captain."You don't know?" The captain took a bite of the apple and smiled at Xu Qing, sizing him up.Xu Qing started and shook his head."Alright, my deputy director. I was the one who taught you that acting skill. You and I both know about what happened with the statue's nose. I won't expose you."After the captain finished eating the apple, he took out a pear and took a big bite."This time, I'll take the blame. Who asked me to be your superior? I won't ask you for spirit stones, but I have two conditions."The captain's eyes revealed a deep look. He looked like he had seen through him and became serious.Xu Qing frowned and his expression was a little hesitant, as though he wasn't sure either.Seeing this scene, the captain took out a pear and threw it over."No need to think about it. It's that reason. I saw it with my own eyes back then. Forget it, forget it. Let me talk about my two conditions. Firstly, you can't mention the matter of me transforming into the third princess again in the future."The captain spoke solemnly."The second thing is that you still have to return the 100,000 spirit stones you owe me!!""As long as you agree, I'll take the blame for the Sea Corpse Race!"The captain took a deep breath and fiercely bit half of the pear in his hand. After that, he observed Xu Qing's subtle expression closely.Xu Qing fell silent. After some thought, he shook his head and looked at the captain as he spoke seriously."Since it's my fault, I'll spread the news to the outside world that I was the one who did this.""I'm the first on the bounty. I'm the main culprit in the case of the Sea Corpse Race's Ancestral Corpse Statue. Captain only assisted a little."After Xu Qing finished speaking, he stood up to leave.When the captain saw this scene, he instantly became anxious. He still valued the glory of being the main culprit very much. However, he wanted to extort a little and didn't expect it to backfire. He hurriedly stopped him and coughed before laughing dryly."Look at you, why are you so serious? I was just joking with you. I was the one who did that. I'm the main culprit. No one can snatch this achievement from me!""No, it's me!" Xu Qing said seriously."It's not you, it's me!" The captain was even more anxious. 🅃🄷🄸🅂 🄲🄷🄰🄿🅃🄴🅁 🅄🄿🄻🄾🄰🄳 🄵🄸🅁🅂🅃 🄰🅃 🄽🄾🅅🄴🄻-🄱🄸🄽.🄲🄾🄼 "No, it's me!" Xu Qing looked at the captain."Xu Qing, I told you it's not you, it's me!" The captain was serious."Is it really you?" Xu Qing frowned as uncertainty appeared in his eyes."Of course it's me. After I ate Binding's flesh, the power of Binding erupted, causing a chain reaction in the statue's body which led to the explosion. This is a fight of divinity. After I returned, I checked some ancient books. Binding used to have some connections with the Sea Corpse Race, so her aura can stimulate the Ancestral Corpse statue!"The captain took a deep breath and spoke solemnly.This time around, Xu Qing was really stunned. He nodded thoughtfully but he still seemed a little hesitant and was about to speak.The captain hurriedly stood up and laughed."Junior Brother, I still have something on, so I'll leave first. Don't think too much. It was really me. Sigh, there is too much work in the department… As for the big plan I mentioned last time, I'll tell you about it when I get all the clues."With that, the captain hurriedly left the private room. After he walked out of the block, he took out an apple and took a bite. His heart completely calmed down and he heaved a sigh of relief."Looks like it's indeed not this kid. Could it really be me? En, it should be me."The captain felt very comfortable and felt that this was only reasonable. After all, as the superior, he was the only one who could be matched with the identity of the main culprit.In the private room, Xu Qing also heaved a sigh of relief and his heart calmed down."The captain shouldn't be suspicious anymore."Xu Qing was satisfied and left the Knowing Dreams Restaurant, returning to his berth. As he continued to cultivate, he was also looking forward to the great plan his captain had mentioned. Time slowly passed as he waited.Very soon, a month passed.In this month, the war between the Sea Corpse Race and the Seven Blood Eyes had reached a critical moment.The gazes of countless races were attracted. This was because… after capturing two sub-islands and having no more obstacles between them and the Sea Corpse Race's main island, the Seven Blood Eyes began their general offensive on the Sea Corpse Race!The Seven Blood Eyes was trying to step on the Sea Corpse Race's main territory.The museum in Port 176 also opened for business.After Zhang San's repair, he successfully fused the two nose pieces together, making them look relatively intact. A fire that burned all year round was put below.As for the ancestor's calligraphy, it was hung high up.The opening of the museum caused a commotion in the entire Seven Blood Eyes. The ancestor and the others on the battlefield also praised endlessly. As for the other races, after being shocked, they couldn't help but want to come over and take a look. Very soon, Port 176 of the Seven Blood Eyes was extremely lively. There were a lot more people than ever. Just like Zhang San had said, the sect made the arrangements for guarding the museum.The Golden Core elders guarding the sect had received the ancestor's orders to protect the safety of this museum no matter what.At the same time, the first wave of rewards for making such a great contribution was sent to Xu Qing and Chen Erniu with the decree of the ancestor."Conferred Chen Erniu and Xu Qing as the Image Disciples of this generation of Seven Blood Eyes. Chen Erniu's sequence has been promoted and Xu Qing has entered the sequence!""Both will be rewarded with three uses of the Seven Blood Eyes' magic treasure projection!""Golden Core opportunity rewarded after the war!""This is the first wave of rewards. When the war ends, we'll reward you again based on the contributions!"As the ancestor's decree was spread, the Seven Blood Eyes were in an uproar. On one hand, it was the sequence. On the other hand, it was Image Disciple.In reality, everyone in the Seven Blood Eyes was a little unfamiliar with the term 'Image Disciple'. Before this… there was no such term in the Seven Blood Eyes.However, very soon, they knew what an Image Disciple was.Xu Qing and the captain were appointed to represent the peak lords of the seven peaks in entertaining all the guests who were visiting to see the nose of the Sea Corpse Race's statue.

Chapter 280 Two Phoenixes Drama
The so-called Image Disciple was the person who represented the Seven Blood Eyes.This way, all the nonhumans who visited the Seven Blood Eyes could see Xu Qing and the captain. Every time they saw them, they would remember the humiliation of the Sea Corpse Race.In the following period, with the arrival of a large number of nonhumans, Xu Qing and the captain had no choice but to get busy.At the moment, Xu Qing was standing at Port 176, silently waiting for the incoming nonhumans at dusk.Under the setting sun, his devilishly handsome face was enough to mesmerize all living beings. As the sea breeze blew over, the fine hair on his forehead fluttered like a black curtain, hiding coldness and impatience.This was already the seventh batch of nonhumans Xu Qing had welcomed in this half a month since he received the ancestor's appointment.However, Xu Qing still couldn't get used to it. He felt a sense of rejection toward this mission.He didn't like to be ostentatious and it made him feel uneasy. However, Xu Qing also understood that the empty name of Image Disciple was also a form of protection for him.This empty name would dispel most of the malice that was stirring. After all... he represented the Seven Blood Eyes.However, because of this, danger would either not appear or would definitely be extremely dangerous.There was also the term 'Sequence'. Xu Qing had heard that it was similar and yet different from the Seven Blood Eyes' Sequence. Before this, only the direct disciples of the seven peak lords could be included in the Sequence.Once one entered the Sequence, it was equivalent to having a special identity. The future peak lord candidates would all be fought for from the Sequence.Their treatment was different from ordinary disciples. Xu Qing could be said to be the only person who entered the Sequence before becoming a peak lord's disciple."Chen Erniu's Sequence is upgraded... The captain should be Eldest Senior Brother." Xu Qing was already certain of this now. However, he vaguely felt that there should be an even greater secret behind the captain.With this thought in mind, although Xu Qing was unwilling, it was difficult for him to directly reject the ancestor's appointment."Why aren't they here yet?" The long hair that was blown by the sea breeze swept past Xu Qing's eyelashes, interrupting his thoughts. He looked at the sea with even more impatience."Senior Brother Xu, I heard that everyone in the Starfish Race has a strange starfish growing on their backs. They usually don't like sunlight, so they might only arrive in the evening."Xu Qing wasn't here alone. There were more than 20 disciples behind him. This was arranged by the captain. The captain was much more enthusiastic about this appointment from the ancestor than him.Many disciples of the sect were called over by the captain to join. At the same time, Xu Qing seemed to have become the captain's trump card. If the guests were mainly female, the captain would usually call Xu Qing over immediately.Every time Xu Qing appeared, it indeed stunned those nonhuman female cultivators who came to see the Ancestral Corpse's nose. They would all be very curious about him.Xu Qing wanted to refuse at first but when he thought about how he could come out much fewer times this way, he tacitly agreed to this arrangement.However, the captain seemed to be worried that Xu Qing would be lonely. Hence, he even thoughtfully arranged for two familiar fellow disciples to be his assistants.One of them was Gu Muqing.Gu Muqing spoke softly. Her face was delicate and pretty, like a lotus in a cup. Her peerless beauty was stifling.At that moment, a faint smile appeared at the corner of her mouth. The slight innocence in her face was extremely captivating, and her orange Daoist robe accentuated her tall figure, making her look more dazzling."Senior Brother Xu, the Starfish Race is being a little excessive. However, it's fine. I've just obtained the recognition of the Seven Sects Alliance. When the war ends, I can go over and learn the Dao of plants and vegetation. When I get there, I'll have the right to make this Starfish Race apologize to Senior Brother!"Also, Senior Brother, these are my learning insights during this time. Please help me check them." 🅃🄷🄸🅂 🄲🄷🄰🄿🅃🄴🅁 🅄🄿🄻🄾🄰🄳 🄵🄸🅁🅂🅃 🄰🅃 🄽🄾🅅🄴🄻-🄱🄸🄽.🄲🄾🄼 Seeing Gu Muqing like this, Ding Xue took a step forward and spoke to Xu Qing as well. She also took out a bundle of spirit tickets and a jade slip.She smiled sweetly, her arms were fairer than snow, and her black hair was dense like the clouds. Her rosy little mouth under her tall nose was slightly open, like a coquettish rose.Her voice was crisp and pleasant to the ears, revealing innocence. However, her eyes were glistening and seemed to be able to make one completely immerse themselves in them with just a glance.Ding Xue was the second assistant the captain had arranged for Xu Qing. These two women stood beside Xu Qing. They were like plum blossoms and <anno data-annotation-id="120b2a33-fb79-4198-bf67-3bfacf472c7e">bamboo</anno>; each had its own advantages.Behind the three of them, among the 30-odd Seven Blood Eyes disciples, there was Zhao Zhongheng.He had to take countless deep breaths in the past half a month to maintain his smile. As for the other disciples in the surroundings, all of them looked at Xu Qing like he was a god.In the past half a month, Gu Muqing and Ding Xue looked to be harmonious, but in reality, the conflicts between them were becoming more and more obvious.For example, at this moment, Gu Muqing glanced at Ding Xue.Ding Xue wasn't to be outdone. After sweeping her gaze over, she raised her beautiful brows and put on an aggrieved expression."Senior Sister Gu, even if the Starfish Race has another reason, that's their business. It's fine if they want me to wait, but I feel uncomfortable to see them making Brother Xu Qing wait. Don't you think so? Brother Xu Qing cultivates so hard and now has to wait for them. They're too much."Gu Muqing's chest heaved. She, who had always had an elegant personality, almost lost control several times in the past half a month. She wasn't good with words. Every time she listened to Ding Xue, she felt that this Ding Xue was a b*tch and felt disgusted."Ding Xue, you always call me Senior Sister. I'm 17 years old this year. May I ask how old you are?"Ding Xue's eyes turned slightly red as she lowered her head and spoke softly."Senior Sister Gu, Xue'er was wrong. I... I'm not good with words. If I said something that offended Senior Sister Gu, please don't take it to heart. I just feel sorry for Brother Xu Qing."The veins on Gu Muqing's forehead bulged and her breathing became slightly hurried.The Seven Blood Eyes disciples behind them all looked at Ding Xue's back meaningfully. They exchanged glances and could see admiration for Ding Xue in each other's eyes.As usual, it was a complete victory.Xu Qing looked at Ding Xue curiously and then at Gu Muqing but didn't bother with them. During this period, he had been sensing that these two fellow disciples were very strange and didn't seem to get along.Just as he was about to speak, a rumbling sound rang out from the distant sea. Xu Qing immediately looked over and saw that under the setting sun, the surface of the sea had turned from calm to turbulent.As waves of rumbling waves echoed, a huge black pentagonal warship rose from the sea ten thousand feet away. There were a total of seven black pentagonal warships moving in a row.An astonishing pressure spread out in all directions. At the same time, the seven huge eyes of the Seven Blood Eyes also emitted a red light, as though they were examining the ships.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. This was because not only was there an array formation in the Seven Blood Eyes that suppressed everything, but half a month ago, the Peak Lord of the Sixth Peak was arranged to return to the sect to recuperate.With the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord holding down the fort, Xu Qing felt much more at ease.As the seven black pentagon warships got closer, Xu Qing saw a large number of cultivators on them. There were about 30 on each ship.The Starfish Race was a humanoid race. The members of the race looked similar to the humans on the surface, but their hair and eyes were blue.Most of them were women.The female cultivators accounted for 70% of the 200-odd Starfish Race members visiting right now. The energy fluctuations from the three people at the front were all very terrifying. In Xu Qing's perception, their aura felt as strong as the Golden Core cultivator with three heads and six arms from the Sea Corpse Race.These three people all looked like middle-aged women. In front of them was a blue-haired girl. This girl had a beautiful appearance with abnormally fair skin and looked to be 16 or 17 years old. She wore a long dress and her gaze was clear.Her gaze swept across the shore and moved away from Gu Muqing and Ding Xue, landing on Xu Qing."Welcome to the Seven Blood Eyes, allies from the Starfish Race." Xu Qing cupped his fists and spoke in a low voice."You're Xu Qing?" The young girl's eyes were filled with curiosity as she asked with a smile."Yes." Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. After he nodded, he calmly spoke."It's already late today. Tomorrow, someone will bring you guys to take a look at the nose piece of the Ancestral Corpse." After saying that, Xu Qing instructed the disciples behind him."Bring them to their place of stay.""Wait a moment, Senior Brother Xu Qing. My Starfish Race hates the Sea Corpse Race deeply. I admire what you did, so I want to give you a gift. Please accept it."The young girl smiled and turned her head to look at the servant behind her. Very soon, the servant took out a conch and handed it to Xu Qing.Xu Qing looked at the young girl."Senior Brother Xu Qing, this is a magic artifact unique to my race. After blowing it, you can obtain the blessing of my race and summon all the mollusks in the nearby Forbidden Sea." After the young girl finished speaking, she bowed lightly and followed the clansmen ashore while glancing at Xu Qing many times.This scene caused Ding Xue to frown and feel a little dissatisfied. Gu Muqing also felt uncomfortable.After everyone from the Starfish Race went ashore. The young girl seemed to have thought of something and walked toward Xu Qing. Ding Xue's brows rose and she was about to speak.However, at this moment, the sound of air breaking suddenly rang out from afar. This sudden scene made the Starfish Race instantly vigilant. The eyes of the three middle-aged women flashed with sharpness.Xu Qing also looked over. The first thing he saw was the captain and the second highness behind the captain.The captain's speed was extremely fast and he arrived beside Xu Qing in an instant. Without even greeting the Starfish Race, he spoke in a low voice."The ancestor has sent a message that Dongyou Island is here to visit!""Dongyou Island?" Xu Qing was stunned. However, as the captain said these three words, Ding Xue's expression changed. The expressions of the three Golden Core cultivators from the Starfish Race also changed drastically."The Island Lord of Dongyou Island is an old woman named Esteemed Master Dongyou. Her cultivation is in the same realm as the ancestor who broke through... The person who came naturally isn't her but her granddaughter. This person's personality isn't good... You have to be careful."The captain's expression was solemn. Just as he finished speaking, a shocking wave suddenly rose in the distant sea!A powerful pressure descended in all directions.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="120b2a33-fb79-4198-bf67-3bfacf472c7e">The raws is plum blossom, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum.

Chapter 281 Ill Intentions
This pressure carried a domineering aura. As soon as it appeared, it stirred up a huge wave at the port, causing the black waves to sweep up and transform into a sea wall that blasted toward the gate outside the Seven Blood Eyes' port.This enormous wave seemed to contain violent power as it triggered the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation. As the seven blood eyes in the distance flickered, a red light screen instantly appeared, blocking the wave.The rumbling and deafening sound spread out at such a close distance that it caused everyone in Port 176 to feel as though lightning had thundered right beside their ears.Xu Qing frowned and waved his right hand. Immediately, the magic power in his body spread out and enveloped Gu Muqing and Ding Xue, isolating them from the sound that could shake one's mind.However, the remaining 30-odd Seven Blood Eyes disciples were a little miserable. All of them spat out blood and retreated one after another. This sound could already cause damage to Qi Condensation disciples.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. The captain at the side stroked his chin and looked at the second highness beside him.The second highness also frowned. She looked at the Seven Blood Eyes' gate in the distance and suddenly spoke."What is the meaning of this?""Aiya, Sister, don't be angry." A crisp voice immediately replied from the port gate.At the next instant, a huge octopus foot broke out of the sea outside the Seven Blood Eyes' port gate.This octopus leg was dozens of feet thick and hundreds of feet long. It directly crossed the Seven Blood Eyes' harbor gate and landed in the port. After that, similar tentacles stretched out from the surface of the sea one after another.At the next instant, an even larger octopus head rose from the sea.On the head of this octopus sat a figure that looked like a young girl. The reason why it looked like her was because she was wearing black tight-fitting clothes. It wasn't a woman's attire at all. In fact, her hair was very short.However, her appearance was extremely delicate. The huge octopus completely crawled out of the sea and directly approached the shore of Port 176.Drops of black seawater landed on the ground and some landed on the Seven Blood Eyes' disciples. As for the Starfish Race members at the side, most of them were trembling and lowering their heads.This huge octopus itself emitted an aura similar to a Golden Core elder!Moreover, due to its size, this terrifying sea beast was much more powerful than other same realm cultivators. The pressure emitted by its strength rampaged everywhere.Xu Qing took a few steps back and avoided the falling seawater. He then coldly looked at the black-clothed girl.This young girl was about 15 or 16 years old. She had an oval face, thin lips, lively brows, and a delicate appearance.Her delicate body leaped up from the head of the octopus and landed gently on the ground. She ran straight for the second highness without even looking at the captain and Xu Qing."Sister, you can't blame me for this. It's all Shrimpy's fault." As she spoke, the young girl waved her right hand behind her. Immediately, sharp spikes appeared out of thin air around her and headed straight for the octopus.Its target wasn't its thick-skinned body but its eyes.The octopus didn't dare to dodge and the black spikes pierced into its eyes. It was clearly in pain but it didn't struggle and allowed the black blood to flow."Sister, don't be angry. I helped you beat it."When Xu Qing saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly. When his gaze swept past the black-clothed girl, his mind shook slightly.In Xu Qing's opinion, the other party was different from anyone he had seen before. Regardless of whether it was the captain, the Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race, or even the sect's elders and peak lords, they were all different from this young girl.She seemed to be… purer!This purity allowed Xu Qing to instantly understand the reason. This reason was the source of the fluctuations in his mind.'She has no anomalous substances!'This was the first time Xu Qing had seen someone else with no anomalous substances other than himself. Her body's purity was like that of a goddess. In fact, he could sense over a hundred magic apertures shining faintly in her body, but they hadn't reached 120.Xu Qing swept his gaze over and confirmed that there were 104 of them. Clearly, this young girl was still at the stage of opening her magic apertures. In the end, she would definitely reach 120 or even surpass it.After all, Xu Qing had sensed back then that 120… wasn't the limit."Yanyan, this is the Seven Blood Eyes. You…" The second highness frowned and spoke unhappily."Alright, alright. Big Sister, I was wrong." The black-clothed girl quickly walked to the second highness' side and hugged her thick arm as she spoke coquettishly.She clearly had a close relationship with the second highness. The second highness shook her head and looked at the captain."Eldest Senior Brother… Yanyan didn't do it on purpose."The captain smiled and sized up the black-clothed girl. The girl also looked at the captain curiously. After that, she revealed two small dimples and smiled faintly."Your eyes are so annoying. If you look at me again, I'll make Shrimpy dig them out."When the captain heard this, his eyes lit up and he tried his best to open them wide, as though he was revealing how good-looking his eyes were. He even took out an apple and took a bite."It's fine. I can even give them to you. How about a bottle of Dongyou Liquid for them?"The black-clothed girl raised her brows.The second highness hurriedly pulled the black-clothed girl. The girl snorted and swept her gaze past everyone here before finally looking at Xu Qing.Originally, she was only looking briefly but at the next instant, she saw Xu Qing's face."Sister, this person isn't from the same sect as you, right? I want his face to be made into a mask. It will definitely look good when I wear it."The black-clothed girl wasn't joking. A strange glint appeared in her eyes. Even the huge octopus at the side revealed a cold glint as its power locked onto Xu Qing.The surrounding people were all nervous, especially the Starfish Race. All of them retreated.Xu Qing didn't speak but the magic power in his body had long gathered. The shadow under his feet was also prepared.The black-clothed girl narrowed her eyes. Beside her, the second highness sighed inwardly and looked at the black-clothed girl solemnly."You cannot!"She knew Xu Qing and also knew that he was Huang Yan's friend. Hence, she looked at Xu Qing after saying that."Xu Qing, I'm sorry. You can leave first. I'll get Huang Yan to explain this to you later."Xu Qing nodded and turned to leave.However, at this moment, when the black-clothed girl heard Huang Yan's name, she suddenly laughed."Sister, why are you so protective of him? Do you like him? Then I don't want his face. I will only cut it."She suddenly moved and her speed instantly erupted, heading straight for Xu Qing. Her eyes revealed intense hostility and ferocity.This ferocious light and hostility came out of nowhere. However, Xu Qing was already on guard. The life fires in his body instantly ignited. The instant he stepped into the Mystic Brilliance Form, he also headed straight for the young girl.At the same time, the octopus at the side emitted the pressure of a Golden Core and was about to attack. However, at this moment, a low shout rang out from the Sixth Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes like thunder."Impudent!"As the voice rang out, the Golden Core octopus trembled and its aura directly dissipated, as though it was suppressed. Boom! It was pressed to the ground by an invisible force and couldn't move.As for the captain, he suddenly headed straight for the octopus suppressed by the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord. A cold aura erupted from his body. After he got close, he directly hugged one of the octopus' legs and bit down.At the same time, Xu Qing and the black-clothed girl also came into contact in mid-air. The girl's fingernails ruthlessly slashed at Xu Qing's face. Xu Qing didn't dodge at all. A dagger appeared in his right and he directly slashed fiercely at the young girl's neck.The young girl twisted her body and dodged Xu Qing's dagger. However, Xu Qing ruthlessly kneed her chest, but the young girl suddenly turned into paper.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. Without the slightest hesitation, he took out a small bottle containing black liquid and slammed it behind him with all his might.The small bottle shattered and the black liquid inside spread out. A portion of it landed on Xu Qing's palm but most of it landed on the right hand of the young girl who suddenly walked out of the void behind Xu Qing.For the first time, the young girl's expression changed. She swung her hand but she couldn't shake the liquid off. The black liquid contained countless small bugs. The moment they came into contact with the young girl's palm, they entered through the pores on her skin."You!"Just as the black-clothed girl was about to speak, killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes. The black iron stick instantly flew up from his shadow and headed straight for the young girl.At this critical moment, an impatient voice rang out from the Sixth Peak. Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "Enough."As soon as this sound rang out, Xu Qing's body trembled. A boundless obstructive force appeared in front of him and he could only retreat.The black-clothed girl was the same. As she retreated, her face was pale. She looked at her palm and swallowed medicinal pills but it was still useless.In the end, she could only grit her teeth and take out a golden talisman, directly sticking it on her right hand. Only then was she able to stop the spreading of the black bugs.The second highness also arrived quickly. She sighed inwardly and revealed an apologetic expression to Xu Qing while supporting the black-clothed girl. "Your name is Xu Qing, right? I have remembered you. I'm definitely going to take your face. Also, tell that fatty Huang Yan that if he comes to pester my sister again, I'll kill him!" The black-clothed girl's expression was gloomy. After she spoke word by word, she was pulled away from the port by the second highness.The captain also went all out at this moment, but he still couldn't move the flesh of the Golden Core creature. He finally chose the small part at the end. By using all his strength, he finally bit off a little of the tentacle.The octopus wanted to struggle but it couldn't move at all. It could only whimper. However, the black-clothed girl had clearly forgotten about it.As for the Starfish Race, all of them looked at Xu Qing and the captain in awe.In their opinion, these two people were lunatics. One took advantage of the fact that the Golden Core sea beast was suppressed and took a bite of it with no regard for his life, while the other actually dared to attack the little princess of the Dongyou Island. Moreover, he attacked with the intent to kill."One is crazier than the other. We can't afford to offend these two!"This made them involuntarily think of the bounty on them put up by the Sea Corpse Race. They felt that it was indeed such people who could do such a big thing. They quickly left one after another.Very soon, only Xu Qing, the captain, and the suppressed octopus were left at the port. As for Gu Muqing, Ding Xue, and the other disciples, they were also arranged by the captain to leave.Ding Xue was a little worried but she knew that they had something to talk about, so she bade farewell and left. However, before Gu Muqing left, she gave Xu Qing a pill bottle."Senior Brother Xu Qing, this pill has the effect of suppressing insect injuries."Xu Qing nodded in thanks and took it. After everyone left, the captain carried the tentacle he had bitten and ran to Xu Qing's side."This matter has nothing to do with me. That girl has liked the second for many years. It's obvious that she found out that you and Huang Yan are good friends. She came this time to find trouble with Huang Yan. You were only implicated.""However, she probably didn't expect you to be so difficult to kill."A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He didn't speak and walked toward the octopus."What are you doing?" The captain looked at Xu Qing."Cut off a leg." Xu Qing calmly spoke."Don't, the suppression time is about to pass!!" The captain was anxious."Then come and help me cut it." Xu Qing walked in front of the huge octopus. Under the other party's angry gaze, a dagger formed in his hand and he slashed fiercely.

Chapter 282 The Homicide Department's Responsibility!
"Why do I feel that you've become greedier than me recently!" The captain said angrily. However, he also attacked violently, causing the cut to enlarge faster.Amidst the monstrous anger in the Golden Core octopus' heart, Xu Qing successfully cut off a small portion of the end of one of its tentacles. It was about ten feet long and he carried it on his shoulder as he quickly fled this place with the captain.A long time later, the pressure on the Golden Core octopus dissipated. It roared and wanted to get up. However, at the next instant, its entire body trembled and it lay on the ground again.This was because a middle-aged man had walked over at some point in time. This middle-aged man had a bitter expression and was drinking from a wine gourd in his hand while walking.It was the Peak Lord of the Sixth Peak.Originally, this Sixth Peak's Peak Lord was a heaven's chosen like Old Master Seventh. He entered the sect at the same time but some tragic things happened to him later.His Dao companion died tragically and only he and his son survived. He gave all his love to his only son while carrying endless grief and indignation. His son indeed didn't let him down.Many years ago, his son had risen to be an outstanding person in the Seven Blood Eyes.However, during an expedition to the sea, his son went missing and the life slip he left in the sect shattered. This matter caused a huge commotion back then but in the end, they still couldn't find the murderer and it became a knot in the heart of the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord that he was still unable to let go.From then on, the wine gourd never left his hand.The Peak Lord of the Sixth Peak, who was drinking wine and feeling bitter to the bone, walked in front of the octopus."I've been refining a magic artifact recently. Your eyes are very suitable. Give them to me."The octopus trembled even more but it didn't dare to hesitate. It quickly lifted its tentacles and pressed them on its eyes, digging hard. Blood spurted out as it dug out its eyeballs and respectfully handed them to the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord."You can scram now. Wait for your master outside." The Sixth Peak's Peak Lord took the eyeballs and threw them into the wine gourd. He then walked toward the Sixth Peak.The octopus respectfully lowered its head. It only lifted its trembling head after the Sixth Peak's Peak Lord disappeared. It quickly returned to the sea and dived extremely deep. After leaving the Seven Blood Eyes, its figure shone and transformed into a burly man.Although he was blind in both eyes, as the flesh and blood between his brows squirmed, another one grew out. At that moment, he looked at the Seven Blood Eyes with a wary expression."With the breakthrough of the Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor, this Seven Blood Eyes is more confident than before. It looks like an external sect established by the Seven Sects Alliance, but in reality, over the years, the Seven Blood Eyes… has almost become independent.""The lower levels are put in a cruel Gu-nurturing environment, while the middle levels are allowed to grow freely. However, once one enters the Sequence and steps into the higher positions, the Seven Blood Eyes will definitely cover their shortcomings and raise them properly!""Even though the Seven Sects Alliance discovered it many years ago and wanted to rotate the candidates for the ancestor and the seven peak lords, the effect was very little. The ancestor, Xue Lianzi, was always around. Even though the seven peak lords occasionally took turns to return to the Seven Sects Alliance, most of them were focused on the Seven Blood Eyes.""This is a sect that is rising!" The fear in the burly man's eyes deepened.While all kinds of thoughts appeared in the heart of the burly Golden Core cultivator, Xu Qing separated from the captain and returned to his berth. He then took out his bamboo slip and carved the word 'Yanyan' on it!However, he drew a circle. This meant that this person couldn't be killed in front of others. He had to wait for the other party to leave the Seven Blood Eyes before finding an opportunity to secretly kill her. Only then could he avoid trouble."Here it comes again!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick was extremely excited at this moment. He looked at the name on the bamboo slip and paid special attention to his own name.After Xu Qing finished carving and was about to put it away, he glanced at the black iron stick that was shaking slightly at the side. He recalled that the other party had been very hardworking, so he cut the words 'Diamond Sect's ancestor'. Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ This cut landed not only on the bamboo slip, but also in the heart of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, transforming into unprecedented excitement and gratitude. The black iron stick's shook more intensely.He felt that all his previous efforts were worth it at this moment!"Thank you… Master!!" The Diamond Sect's ancestor's figure appeared and bowed to Xu Qing. He had suffered a lot during this period, especially since the shadow had made many contributions, causing the pressure in his heart to be extremely great. There were a few times when he almost suffered from inner demons while cultivating. He could not shake off the feeling that he would be abandoned at any moment. At this moment, more than half of his worries dissipated with Xu Qing's slash.The agitated Diamond Sect's ancestor didn't notice the shadow behind Xu Qing. It had opened an eye and was trying its best to observe and learn.Xu Qing encouraged the Diamond Sect's ancestor. After putting away the bamboo slip, he walked out of the cabin and sat there looking into the distance.He was waiting for someone.Not long later, at midnight, a rotund figure staggered into Xu Qing's vision. As he got closer, he could see that it was none other than Huang Yan.He had clearly drunk a lot of alcohol and his walking was crooked and listless. This time, he didn't sit on the ground but leaped onto Xu Qing's magic ship for the first time.After landing, he sat at the side and let out a long sigh."Brother Xu Qing, take it that I owe you for what happened today. I'm really sorry. I didn't expect Senior Sister's best friend to be such a trash!"As he spoke, Huang Yan took out a storage bag and solemnly handed it to Xu Qing."Brother Xu Qing, I don't have many things on me at the moment. There are 200,000 spirit stones here. Take it as my goodwill."Xu Qing didn't take it immediately. Instead, he looked at Huang Yan."How do you plan to handle this?"Huang Yan sighed."Why is love so torturous?""It's too difficult for me. Xu Qing, do you know that I came to the Seven Blood Eyes for Senior Sister? Back then… I glanced at her from afar. From then on, my heart was filled with her figure. In the end, I decided to come to the Seven Blood Eyes. I wanted to make her my Dao companion."Huang Yan's mood today was a little different from usual. He took out a wine flask and took a big gulp before throwing it to Xu Qing.Xu Qing caught it and took a sip as well."I never expected that her best friend would be my rival!!""Do you know that after that b*tch arrived today, she kept pestering Senior Sister and Senior Sister didn't have the time to care about me. When I went to look for Senior Sister today, Senior Sister sent me away with a guilty expression!!""I immediately felt that something was wrong. When I went to drink, I asked around and found out that that little girl actually wanted to snatch Senior Sister from me!"Huang Yan gritted his teeth."Why did it have to be at this time? If it was a few months ago, I would have blown her to death."Huang Yan's emotions fluctuated intensely.A look of confusion appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. He didn't understand these things very well and had never experienced such distress. Hence, he didn't understand or know how to comfort him. He could only lift the flask.Huang Yan glanced at Xu Qing and sighed again. He then took out another wine flask and clinked it with Xu Qing's and took a big gulp."You're still too young…" Just as he said this, the voice transmission jade slip in Huang Yan's storage bag vibrated rapidly. He frowned and took it out. After taking a look, his expression instantly became displeased.At the same time, Xu Qing's voice transmission jade slip also vibrated. Xu Qing calmly took it out. As magic power surged in, messages quickly appeared one after another."Fifteen minutes ago, the Black Division of the Homicide Department received a request for help from the Patrol Department. An external Foundation Building expert wrecked the Pilotage Department. Many disciples were injured and the Patrol Department went over. Their director was heavily injured and the rest were suppressed.""The Black Division responded and went over, but they couldn't stop the expert and were also suppressed.""The other party requests for Huang Yan from Port 176's Pilotage Department to meet her immediately.""This matter is beyond our ability. Deputy Director, please make a decision."Xu Qing looked at Huang Yan beside him. Huang Yan also lifted his head with an ugly expression. After meeting Xu Qing's gaze, he revealed an apologetic expression. After that, he suddenly stood up and walked out of the magic ship in a flash, heading straight for the Pilotage Department.Xu Qing looked at Huang Yan's back and thought of the scenes in the Sixth Peak's shop back then. He then looked at the storage bag Huang Yan had secretly placed at the side before he left because he didn't accept it earlier."Huang Yan is a loyal person." Xu Qing silently stood up and walked toward the Pilotage Department.His speed was faster than Huang Yan's, so it wasn't long before he saw Huang Yan running in the distance. Xu Qing's arrival also made Huang Yan fall silent before he smiled at him."Why are you here?""The Pilotage Department reported a case, so I naturally have to go." Xu Qing also smiled."Xu Qing, you're a special person. In all the years I've been in the Seven Blood Eyes, I don't have a single friend. I only have Senior Sister in my eyes but in the past year, I got a friend like you.""I have very few friends…" Huang Yan took a deep breath and didn't continue speaking. He ran with all his might and got closer and closer to the Pilotage Department under Xu Qing's company.The building of the Pilotage Department in Port 176 was shaped like a sailboat. The instant they got close, an astonishing energy fluctuation spread from the sailboat.The sailboat building directly collapsed from the middle and shattered into pieces. A black figure rushed out with an astonishing speed, heading straight for Huang Yan.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He immediately lit his life fires and activated the Mystic Brilliance Form, and stood in front of Huang Yan. He waved his right hand fiercely; immediately, black flames spread out in a large area and collided with the approaching black figure.A loud sound spread in all directions. The black figure distorted and appeared on the gravel at the side. It was none other than the black-clothed girl, Yanyan, who had fought with Xu Qing earlier."Why is it you again!" The black-clothed girl stared at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's gaze swept past Yanyan and looked at the destroyed Pilotage Department. He saw at least a hundred disciples from the three departments lying there in a mess.All of them were heavily injured but there were no deaths. Xu Qing even saw the little mute among them.Xu Qing's expression turned gloomy. He then surveyed his surroundings."There's no need to look. With my status, even if I killed any of these piedmont disciples, do you think your sect will stop me? From the moment I arrived here until now, no one has stopped me."The black-clothed girl looked at Xu Qing's face and licked her lips."However, I didn't expect you to actually be in the Seven Blood Eyes' Sequence. If that's the case, it'll be a little difficult.""You're wrong." Xu Qing calmly spoke."The reason why the sect didn't attack you is because this matter falls under the responsibility of the Homicide Department. Before I report it, this place is still under the responsibility of the Homicide Department."With that, Xu Qing lifted his right hand and crushed a signal jade slip that belonged to the Homicide Department. At the next instant, a bright beam of light rose into the air from the shattered jade slip. In the dark night, it emitted a rainbow light that formed the shape of '凶'!At the same time, Xu Qing's voice spread in all directions."Rule Seven of the Homicide Department: If foreign cultivators cause chaos in the main city, the Homicide Department can capture them. All members of the Black Division, listen up. Seal Port 176 and arrest this criminal!"

Chapter 283 What Is Sequence!
"Arrest?" The black-clothed girl laughed. However, the instant her laughter rang out, voices from countless corners of Port 176 rang out in unison."I obey the order!"As the voices rang out, figures rushed out from all corners. There were over a thousand of them and they sealed off the entire Port 176."A mere group of Qi Condensation cultivators wants to block me? I'll kill a few first for you to see!"Killing intent appeared in the black-clothed girl's eyes. The three life fires in her body were instantly ignited and their light overflowed into the sky. Her speed also erupted as she soared into the air and headed straight for the Homicide Department's disciples who had rushed out.Xu Qing coldly looked over and raised his identity token."Xu Qing, deputy director of the Homicide Department, requests for the sect's array formation to seal the sky of Port 176, so that no foreign cultivators may fly here!"As soon as Xu Qing finished speaking, a bell chime rang out from all directions. The power of the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation erupted and directly enveloped this place, causing the expression of the black-clothed girl who was flying in the air to change.Boom! Her body was suppressed by a huge force and forcefully pressed to the ground. It was difficult for her to soar into the air. In fact, the life fires in her body were shaking."How dare you!" Although the young girl was suppressed, the killing intent in her eyes didn't decrease. Instead, it intensified and her anger soared to the sky.Xu Qing wasn't lying. The reason why this young girl could be so arrogant and no one stopped her previously was because the order and laws in the Seven Blood Eyes were extremely strict. There would almost never be anything like going off the rails. Unless the lower-level departments couldn't deal with it and chose to report it, the higher-level departments wouldn't participate.The entire Seven Blood Eyes was operated based on this rule system with occasional exceptions."Foreign cultivators can't light two fires here!"Xu Qing coldly looked at the furious young girl. There was no need for him to make a move. With the authority of the Homicide Department and his identity as a member of the Sequence, he seemed to have the power of laws in the Seven Blood Eyes.The reason he was doing this was because he sensed many gazes were focused here. He didn't want to expose some of his secrets by attacking.As his voice rang out, the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation instantly rumbled and an invisible force enveloped Port 176 again. The expression of the black-clothed girl changed drastically as her third ball of life fire was instantly extinguished!Her second ball of life fire was also forcefully extinguished!Only a life fire was still burning. Being suppressed like this inflicted some backlash to the black-clothed girl and she spat out a mouthful of blood. However, the veins on her forehead were still bulging ferociously and the killing intent in her eyes was shocking.She struggled crazily.However, Xu Qing made his move at this moment. With the shadow covering the life lantern, his two life fires ignited and boosted his speed. He arrived in front of the young girl almost instantly and slapped her.The right side of the young girl's face swelled up and she spat out a large mouthful of blood along with many teeth. Her body directly collided with a building at the side.Xu Qing took a step forward. He immediately arrived in front of the young girl and stepped on her.A light flashed from the pendant on the young girl's body and a protective barrier appeared, blocking Xu Qing's right foot.As for the young girl, she borrowed the time to quickly crawl into the distance. Her expression was sinister and her eyes were filled with madness. She directly tore off the pendant with a ruthless expression."Foreign cultivators can't use any magic artifacts and magic treasures!"Xu Qing calmly spoke and the array formation descended again.The protective light on the young girl's body directly collapsed. Blood flowed out of her body and she let out an indignant mournful cry as she stared fixedly at Xu Qing. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ  "If you have the ability, fight me properly!""Idiot." Xu Qing directly arrived in front of the black-clothed girl. With another slap, the girl's body flew out again. Many of her teeth were shattered. The instant she landed on the ground, she took out a jade slip and crushed it. Immediately, the power of teleportation spread out."Foreign cultivators are forbidden from teleporting." Xu Qing calmly spoke.The Seven Blood Eyes' array formation descended again, destroying all traces of teleportation. The black-clothed girl's eyes revealed indignance. Just as she was about to speak, Xu Qing had already arrived in front of her and slapped her again.The black-clothed girl spat out more blood and her body went limp. However, her expression was still sinister and her anger was still intense. Even if she died, she wouldn't submit.Xu Qing cast a meaningful glance at the young girl. Although his principle was to kill all existences that threatened his life, he wasn't a fool.To do such a thing in front of so many people and attract great trouble and crisis for himself was not principle. It was stupidity.Hence, he restrained his killing intent. He slapped the young girl again. With a boom, blood spurted out of the young girl again and the only ball of life fire in her body was extinguished. She directly fainted from the heavy injuries.The degree of her injuries was about the same as those disciples who had fainted from her attacks earlier.After doing this, Xu Qing stood on the spot and grabbed the young girl's hair. He then turned his head and calmly spoke."Magic sealing rings!"Immediately, dozens of figures from the Homicide Department arrived behind him. Their gazes toward Xu Qing was filled with reverence. After they got close, they quickly took out bracelet-like items and pressed them on the young girl's arms.The young girl immediately woke up. She let out a low shout and the magic rings on her arms instantly shattered.The young girl laughed wildly."Xu Qing, I'll remember you. No one has ever dared to be so disrespectful to me. You're the first!" As soon as she finished speaking, Xu Qing expressionlessly walked over and slapped her again.The girl's head hit the ground and she really fainted."Use ten rings."Xu Qing calmly spoke.This ring was specially designed by the Homicide Department to target foreign Foundation Building cultivators. Two of them could suppress one life fire, and ten of them were more than enough to seal the power of three fires.Back then, the director of the Homicide Department had used this ring on a foreign criminal.Very soon, ten rings were put on the unconscious black-clothed girl's body."Send her to the Black Division. Without my warrant, she can't be released!" Xu Qing's expression was calm. After his voice rang out, more disciples from the Homicide Department arrived in the surroundings and were about to carry the young girl away.At that moment, the sound of air breaking rang out from the distant sky and a voice arrived."Junior Brother Xu Qing, can you make an exception for this matter!"Xu Qing lifted his head. The tall figure of the second highness was rapidly visible in the sky. There were still some traces of her breaking through the restrictions on her body. Clearly, she had been imprisoned previously, so she couldn't stop the black-clothed girl's arrival."Greetings, second highness." Xu Qing cupped his fists and looked at Huang Yan not far away.Huang Yan looked at the second highness and spoke in a low voice."Senior Sister, Xu Qing is helping me."The second highness wanted to say something but hesitated. She looked at Huang Yan and then at the black-clothed girl who was being carried away. She hesitated."Junior Brother Xu Qing, if she dies, the ancestor will be in a difficult position." These words didn't contain any threat but were filled with misgivings and reminders."She violated the sect's rules but fortunately, she didn't kill anyone, so her crime isn't punishable by death. However, she still has to be imprisoned. This is the sect's rule."Xu Qing said softly.The second highness nodded."It's fine as long as she doesn't die. I'm also a little annoyed by her. Thank you for this, Junior Brother Xu Qing." With that, she looked at Huang Yan. Her gaze gradually softened as she walked over.Seeing the two of them like this, Xu Qing retracted his gaze and stood on the spot, waiting silently.As for the injured, they had already been taken care of. Very soon, Huang Yan cupped his fists and left. This place became quiet.Xu Qing waited silently. This time, he had acted not only to help Huang Yan but also because the black-clothed girl had provoked him. In addition, he also wanted to see to what extent the so-called Sequence could protect him in the Seven Blood Eyes.Not long later, a figure walked over from the sky. It was an old man wearing a blue Daoist robe. His Golden Core cultivation fluctuations were extremely strong. As he arrived, a pressure spread in all directions.Xu Qing lowered his head and cupped his fists."Greetings, Elder."Xu Qing didn't know who it was but in the Seven Blood Eyes, the person wearing such a Daoist robe and exuding such pressure was naturally one of the elders.The old man stood in the air and sized up Xu Qing a few times. A hint of admiration appeared in his eyes as he spoke."Xu Qing, Old Master Sixth asked me to ask you something. How do you plan to deal with this matter?""Can I kill her?" Xu Qing asked."No, although that girl is bossy, her crime doesn't deserve death. Besides, her grandmother has a good personal relationship with the ancestor."Xu Qing nodded."According to the sect's rules, she will be stripped of her cultivation base and be imprisoned in the Candle Bone Cave for three years."The Sixth Peak's elder smiled when he heard this. He naturally saw Xu Qing's intentions and knew that the girl was the one who provoked this matter first. If Xu Qing wasn't in the Sequence, he wouldn't be so kind.However, entering the sequence meant that he was the future and seed of their Seven Blood Eyes. Such a person couldn't be allowed to be humiliated casually, especially now that the ancestor was clearly very gratified by what they had done.Also, as an Image Disciple, being provoked by outsiders in the sect could not be allowed."Do as you see fit, but forget about crippling her cultivation base."With that, the Golden Core elder turned and left.Xu Qing cupped his fists and sent him off respectfully. After the other party left, he walked toward his berth. At the same time, he was rapidly analyzing the pros and cons of what he did.Other than attracting the hatred of the black-clothed girl and the force behind her, there was no other disadvantage.He had instead benefited a lot. Putting aside Huang Yan, the most important thing was that he had discovered the value of the Sequence in the Seven Blood Eyes."From the looks of it, the Seven Blood Eyes' tolerance and kindness toward those in the Sequence are extremely high."Xu Qing recalled his experience after entering the Seven Blood Eyes and fell into deep thought. He thought of what Zhang Yunshi, who had guided him on the Seventh Peak, had said.Back then, the other party had said that the piedmont disciples were nurtured in a Gu-nurturing environment while the disciples on the mountain were allowed to grow freely.From the looks of it, due to Zhang Yunshi's identity, he didn't know about the Sequence. Now, in Xu Qing's judgment, the Sequence was similar to the true core of the Seven Blood Eyes."As long as I don't do something like betraying the sect, I'm safe in the Seven Blood Eyes." Xu Qing pondered. At the same time, he understood the drawback of the Sequence. It was that his bond with the Seven Blood Eyes had become extremely deep.This wasn't an emotional bond but a matter of status and the perception of the outsiders.

Chapter 284 Promotion Again (1)
Time flowed by and in the blink of an eye, seven days passed.The black-clothed girl from Dongyou Island was imprisoned in the Black Division. Even though her cultivation base was sealed with ten magic sealing rings, she was still unconvinced and hurled all kinds of curses at Xu Qing. Unfortunately for her, sound couldn't be transmitted from the dungeon room she was in.However, she was clearly energetic. Even though seven days had passed and the Seven Blood Eyes had not released her yet, she became even crazier.After Xu Qing found out about this, he ordered for another ten rings to be added on her body. Under the huge sealing force, the black-clothed girl became even more crazy, but she didn't have much strength, so her daily cursing lessened.Xu Qing didn't go take a look at her. He only checked the other party's recent condition in the reports and didn't bother with her.As for when to release this girl, Xu Qing felt that there was no need to hurry. Moreover, the sect's attitude toward this matter was very interesting. Other than that day, they didn't ask anything.It was as though they really gave him full control over this matter. This was the first time Xu Qing had felt this strange feeling in the Seven Blood Eyes."Is it because of the Sequence?" Xu Qing fell into deep thought. However, he knew his limits and naturally wouldn't be stupid enough to kill the black-clothed girl in the open.He would wait till she was released and no one was paying attention.Hence, he was also waiting for the sect's follow-up notice of this matter. Clearly, this matter couldn't be settled so easily. After all, the Seven Blood Eyes had the reason on their side and would demand an explanation for this to save their reputation. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ Even in this wartime, this reputation was still extremely important.Xu Qing felt that there was a high chance that this was the case. Not expressing their stance was actually tacit agreement.During these seven days, as an Image Disciple, Xu Qing was dispatched twice to welcome visitors from other races. During this period of time as an Image Disciple, his reputation rose in another way.Sometimes, some female members of the nonhuman races would even take the initiative to request to see Xu Qing. All the nonhuman female cultivators who had seen Xu Qing were stunned by his looks.Although the races were different, as the former rulers of the Wanggu Continent, even though the human race had declined now, the understanding and aesthetic standards engraved in the bloodlines of the other nonhuman races had not dissipated yet.Hence, the gifts Xu Qing received filled an entire storage bag.This made Ding Xue and Gu Muqing very vigilant. At the same time, the impatience in Xu Qing's heart decreased by a lot. After all, the value of the gifts he got was quite high.However, this good thing didn't continue for long. The heat caused by the nose piece of the Sea Corpse Race's Ancestral Corpse Statue gradually lessened and many of the visitors left.There were only a few allies like the Starfish Race who hadn't left yet and were purchasing a lot of items in the main city. As for the young girl from the Starfish Race, she seemed to be very interested in Xu Qing and came to visit many times.However, other than the gift she gave Xu Qing when they first met, she didn't give any other gifts in her subsequent visits. Instead, she would ask innocently, as though she was extremely curious about Xu Qing and wanted to understand him completely.After Xu Qing dealt with it once, he directly rejected her subsequent visits.Regarding the reassignment of Xu Qing and the captain, Xu Qing was promoted from the deputy director of the Homicide Department to the director because of his previous great contribution!He controlled the entire Seventh Peak's Homicide Department.On the captain's side, he should have been promoted to the deputy minister of the Homicide Ministry that was in charge of the entire Seven Blood Eyes. However, for some reason, he didn't go to the ministry, and instead, went to the Seventh Peak's Intelligence Department and became the director there.There was a huge difference between the department and the ministry. There was a Homicide Department in each of the seven mountain peaks. Above them was the Seven Blood Eyes' Homicide Ministry."Only a fool would go to the ministry. How much better is the Intelligence Department? That's a place I've dreamed of. I'll know everything there. Regardless of whether it's planting spies outside, screening spies internally, or investigating information about nonhuman races, these are all my forte. It'll be more convenient for me to dig out some great opportunities!"On his first day as the director of the Intelligence Department, the captain called out Zhang San and arrived at Xu Qing's place in high spirits. The three of them sat together and drank. When Zhang San saw that Xu Qing and the captain had both been promoted, he was happy but also a little bitter.​ "The next time you guys go out to go crazy, you can consider calling me. Captain, what do you think? With me around, at least if you lose half of your body, there will be someone to carry you," Zhang San said faintly.The captain took a bite of the apple and patted Zhang San's shoulder with a smile."Little San, don't be jealous. Brother still loves you!"After saying that, the captain looked at Xu Qing and discovered that Xu Qing was sitting there distractedly, as though he was thinking about something."Fool, what are you doing?"Xu Qing glanced at the captain before looking at the equally curious Zhang San."Erniu, I'm thinking about how to improve the poison so that it can pose a threat to the Golden Core."Xu Qing had been thinking about this question during this period of time. As for the direction, it was the black bugs he had obtained.Although he had used up most of the black bugs in the battle with the black-clothed girl, after Xu Qing collected the remaining ones, he felt that it was too weak to use them like that.In fact, he even faintly felt that he hadn't completely unleashed the potential of these little bugs. After all… this was created by a Golden Core expert. There was no reason for their might to decrease to such an extent that they couldn't even instantly suppress a three fires cultivator.

Chapter 285 Promotion Again (2)
When Zhang San heard this, he took a deep breath. He felt that Xu Qing was different from before. He was actually thinking about how to deal with Golden Cores… When he thought of Xu Qing's poison, he instinctively moved back a little.The captain also widened his eyes. He suddenly felt that Xu Qing's words were very cool and possessed the characteristic of being able to stand out without batting an eyelid. Hence, he silently remembered it. After that, he coughed and took out a medicinal pill, swallowing it warily."You'll have to slowly study this. Let me get down to business first. I am now the director of the Intelligence Department and Xu Qing is the director of the Homicide Department. These two departments didn't get along in the past, but we are one family now.""I have a plan. Since these two departments are under our management, we have to build up some achievements. We have to rely on these two departments to control the entire Seventh Peak and enjoy a peak lord's authority to the fullest before the war ends!""This way, even after the old man and the others return after the battle, they won't be able to do anything to us for a while. The two of us will become cultivators with real power. This will make it easier for us to do big things in the future."Xu Qing frowned slightly."Captain, I want to enter seclusion for a while and focus on studying this poison.""You need money to study poison, right?" The captain looked at Xu Qing."I have enough for now." Xu Qing shook his head."You need someone to do the test for you, right? You have to find some people to test the poison, right?" The captain didn't give up. He spoke while eating the apple."I have enough for now." Xu Qing shook his head. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ The captain was a little discouraged. He suddenly felt that Xu Qing wasn't easy to fool. It wasn't like when he first arrived at the sect, where he could fool him however he wanted. He just had to crook his finger and Xu Qing would have to work.All kinds of thoughts rapidly ran through his mind. Just as he was thinking about how to pull Xu Qing in his plan, Xu Qing's eyes suddenly lit up. He thought of a key point in refining the little black bug and immediately stood up."Captain, Senior Brother Zhang San, I'll take my leave first. Let's meet again when we have time."Xu Qing cupped his fists and headed straight for his magic ship. After entering the cabin, he immediately activated the protective barrier. After that, he sat down and took out a large number of medicinal herbs. He then took out the bottle containing the little black bugs and began to mix them according to the recipe he thought of.Outside the magic ship, Zhang San and the captain looked at each other."Captain, should we leave this place? I feel that this place is a little unsafe…" Zhang San hesitated."What's there to be afraid of? I…" Just as the captain finished speaking, a rumbling sound suddenly rang out from Xu Qing's magic ship. A poisonous fog spread out from within. Fortunately, there was a protective barrier blocking it, so it didn't spread out.The captain fell silent for a few breaths before standing up and laughing."Zhang San, let's go. It's been a long time since I went to your Transportation Department. Let's continue drinking at your place."Zhang San immediately stood up and the two of them quickly left this place.Not long after they left, rumbling sounds rang out from Xu Qing's cabin again.Xu Qing was indeed studying the rearing of the little black bug. This was the only thing with the might of a Golden Core on him now. He originally planned to use it as a trump card but the incident with the black-clothed girl earlier had disappointed him.A night passed. He had been trying for the entire night, using all kinds of herbs and poisons, trying to catalyze these little black bugs to their full potential.However, they all failed. Only the flesh of the Golden Core octopus had some effect, causing the number of little black bugs to increase by quite a bit."However, if it can only be reared with the flesh and blood of a Golden Core cultivator, then these venomous bugs are worthless. It can't defeat a Golden Core cultivator but needs to feed on their flesh and blood. It's useless to me. I want to use it as a trump card to intimidate Golden Core cultivators. However, maybe… I haven't found the right method."Xu Qing mumbled and took out a thick pharmacopeia from the side. This pharmacopeia was given to Xu Qing by Grandmaster Bai before he left.Xu Qing had always treasured it and had checked it countless times. All the pages inside were about to tear from the repeated uses. Hence, he was very careful when perusing it. This was a gift Grandmaster Bai had left for him. It also carried Xu Qing's gratitude to Grandmaster Bai.It could be said that Grandmaster Bai was his true first master. He played an extremely critical role in the opening of his Dao of vegetation and the subsequent development of his poison Dao.Without Grandmaster Bai, Xu Qing would know nothing about plants and vegetation, and the Dao of Poison wouldn't have become an important method for him."I wonder how Grandmaster Bai is." Xu Qing took a deep breath. After he reached the Foundation Building realm, he had inquired about Grandmaster Bai's whereabouts. However, the other party traveled everywhere and the time he returned to Purple Earth was very short every time.Xu Qing retracted his thoughts and silently flipped open the medical book, searching for clues that could stir his thoughts."Grandmaster Bai once said that although the Dao of Insects and the Dao of Medicine seem different, their intrinsic quality is similar. They can complement each other…" Xu Qing fell silent. Finally, his gaze landed on the description of a medicinal herb in the book."Fourth Night Orchid?" Xu Qing revealed a look of contemplation. This was a medicinal herb that ferocious beasts liked and was useless to cultivators. If ferocious beasts who hadn't awakened their spirituality ate it, it could increase their intelligence. It was also one of the basic medicinal herbs for the Transformation Pill."I can give it a try!" Xu Qing stood up and walked out of the magic ship, heading to Port 176's medicinal shop. His arrival immediately attracted the attention of everyone in the shop. After the shopkeeper heard Xu Qing's request, he immediately prepared it for him.Not long later, Xu Qing left with a storage bag. A hint of heartache flashed in his eyes."Why is this thing so expensive!"This storage bag not only contained the fourth night orchid but also all kinds of medicinal herbs related to beast rearing that could be bought on the market, and there were also many poisonous grasses.Some were cheap and some were extremely expensive.However, Xu Qing didn't want to care about these at this moment. He felt that he had to have a method to threaten the Golden Core. Hence, after returning to the magic ship, he studied and tried again.Just like that, another seven days passed.In these seven days, everyone in the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes was in a state of panic. After the new director of the Intelligence Department, Chen Erniu, took office, the first thing he did was announce that he wanted to capture moles.With joint enforcement with the Patrol Department, every department was within the scope of investigation. Even Foundation Building cultivators were investigated.For a moment, in the eyes of all the Seventh Peak's disciples, the captain was like a rabid dog. However, his status was too high, so the others could only lower their heads and allow themselves to be investigated.As for Xu Qing, he bought countless medicinal herbs to test in these seven days. Finally, he found seven types of medicinal herbs that clearly stimulated the growth of the little black bugs.However, this wasn't enough. Xu Qing could already tell that… if he wanted to truly rear these little black bugs and make them continue to grow, he still needed blood and flesh!"However, with these medicinal herbs, I finally don't need the flesh and blood of Golden Core beings…" A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. On this dusk, he went to the underground prison of the Black Division!Back then, when the captain asked him if he needed a poison tester, Xu Qing had said that he had enough. The poison testers for him were the prisoners of the Black Division.Almost everyone who was imprisoned was a wanted criminal who had committed many evil deeds. Night Dove was among them. There were even many Foundation Building cultivators imprisoned in the prison. There were only a few humans among them, with most being nonhumans."It's a pity that ever since the Homicide Department was established, no Golden Core cultivators have been imprisoned. If only there is a chance in the future to capture a few alive."A rather bold thought rose in Xu Qing's mind and he was very tempted.

Chapter 286 Killing The Goat To Scare The Girl
With this thought in mind, Xu Qing walked toward Port 176's Black Division.It was late at night. Due to the madness of the Intelligence Department during this period of time, everyone was in a state of panic. This also affected the business of some brothels. After all, people weren't in the mood to have fun.The Seven Blood Eyes' rules system caused there to be… quite a lot of moles.The Gu nurturing of Qi Condensation disciples caused them to have no sense of belonging, and the sect didn't need it as well. Everything was about benefits.In addition, Foundation Building cultivators were allowed to grow freely. They didn't feel any psychological burden selling some information they knew for some benefits.Of course, there was a price to pay for selling the information.However, Xu Qing didn't care about these. He walked in the darkness and passed by many remote places, not caring about the little mute who was following behind him.This lasted until they arrived at the Black Division.At the entrance of the Black Division, the two disciples guarding there revealed fanaticism in their eyes the moment they saw Xu Qing. They lowered their heads and knelt."Greetings, Director!"To them, the name 'Xu Qing' was already a legend.At the start, the other party was also a member of the Homicide Department. After that, he rose all the way to the Foundation Building realm in a year, formed a life fire in a few months, and became a two fires cultivator in less than two years. He even did earth-shattering things in the Sea Corpse Race.Just some time ago, he had suppressed the little princess of Dongyou Island. At this moment, the other party was still locked up in the Black Division's prison. All of this made Xu Qing a target for reverence for countless disciples in the Homicide Department.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. He nodded and walked past. After stepping into the Black Division, he directly arrived at the prison.The prison of the Black Division was built underground and only had one floor.Regardless of whether it was Qi Condensation, Foundation Building, or special cultivators, they were all imprisoned on the first floor. There were hundreds of iron bars here and a large number of array formations and restrictions.At the same time, the harsh environment caused the smell here to be extremely unpleasant. Regardless of whether it was the smell of dirt, feces, or urine, when mixed together, it was enough to make anyone feel nauseous.Most of the prisoners were wanted nonhuman criminals. Among them, none had been captured by Xu Qing. This was because Xu Qing only took the heads.Xu Qing's arrival immediately attracted the attention of these nonhuman cultivators. All of them bared their teeth. Some were grinning cheekily, some directly spat out dirty phlegm, and some whistled and assumed vulgar postures when they saw Xu Qing.They weren't afraid of death.Being imprisoned here with no chance to see the light of day again, they had lost fear of death. Waves of strange cries rang out from these prisoners. Xu Qing even heard the voice of the black-clothed girl in the distance."Xu Qing, I curse you to die a horrible death. When I get out, I'll cut your stomach open and dig out your heart and eat it!!"Xu Qing didn't bother with the various antics of these nonhuman criminals. He turned and calmly spoke to the little mute who was standing outside."No matter what sounds come from inside later, don't disturb me."The little mute immediately nodded. The other members of the Homicide Department outside also had solemn expressions.Xu Qing didn't say anything else and closed the prison door.As the gate closed, the clamor in the prison became even more intense."This is a human with a woman's appearance and a man's body? Haha, I like to play with such things. Just looking at him makes me have the urge.""Come, come, come. Human brat, scratch my b*lls.""Foundation Building is nothing. Kill me if you dare!""Senior, don't listen to them. Senior, save me. I know a huge secret."At the same time, in the cage where the black-clothed girl was, she suddenly got up and grabbed the iron railing. No matter how her hands emitted the sizzling sound of being burned by the array formation, she didn't care.Her eyes were filled with madness as she stared fixedly at Xu Qing in the distance and laughed sinisterly."Xu Qing, I cursed you 2,737,856 times!"Xu Qing calmly swept his gaze across the surrounding cages. Finally, his gaze landed on a goat-headed cultivator who was wagging its hips at him.This goat-headed cultivator was a member of the Night Dove and was a mutated beast with its entire body covered in black fur. He had Foundation Building cultivation base.His cultivation base had been sealed, but his vitality was very tenacious. Noticing that Xu Qing was looking at him, Goat Head licked its lips."Me? Come, come, come. Choose me, choose me. Back then, I ate countless humans. I want to have a taste of a beauty like you, haha."Xu Qing nodded and grabbed at the air. Immediately, the gate of the cage where Goat Head was located opened. A huge force swept up Goat Head and brought it straight to Xu Qing.Finally, it was held firmly in the air. Goat Head laughed loudly with madness in its eyes. Just as it was about to speak, Xu Qing waved his hand and a cloud of medicinal powder spread out, enveloping the surroundings of Goat Head and rapidly merging into its body."Poison? This is nothing. I…"Goat Head had not even finished speaking when his body started trembling but his face was still sinister."How comfortable!"Xu Qing ignored it and observed carefully. When Goat Head trembled even more intensely and its seven orifices began to bleed, Xu Qing took out the little black bug's bottle and opened it to spread out a portion.Immediately, these little black bugs entered Goat Head's body.This pain caused the eyes of Goat Head to turn red. However, the madness on its face was still there. However, upon closer inspection, one could see deep horror hidden in the depths of its eyes.At the next instant, its body visibly withered a little. The black bugs that had entered it flew out and were being observed by Xu Qing. As for Goat Head, it landed on the ground. Its entire body was trembling but the madness on its face was even more intense."That's it?"Xu Qing turned a deaf ear and observed the little black bugs. He discovered that their auras seemed to be a little denser but only a little.This made Xu Qing a little puzzled. According to his previous research, when the seven types of medicinal herbs were fused into the live flesh and blood, they should be able to make his little black bugs grow stronger. However, the increase now didn't meet his expectations."I want to see where it went wrong."Xu Qing mumbled. He grabbed the head of Goat Head. Just as Goat Head was about to mock him, Xu Qing expressionlessly took out a dagger and slit its stomach. He then started rummaging through its organs.A mournful cry rang out before quickly transforming into terrified screams and wails that spread in the whole prison. However, the screams quickly weakened.As for the various voices in the surrounding cages, they stopped abruptly. Many wary gazes landed on Xu Qing as they watched him calmly studying.A moment later, Xu Qing, who had dissected Ghost Head alive, fell into deep thought. He grabbed at the air again. The middle-aged cultivator who had spat out thick phlegm at him was grabbed.This was a merfolk.Its eyes revealed horror and its breathing was hurried. Just as it was about to speak, Xu Qing sprinkled medicinal powder and released the little black bugs again.A moment later, screams rang out and the same scene appeared. Xu Qing frowned and opened the merfolk's body to inspect it.Time slowly passed. All the nonhuman cultivators in the prison had stopped making noises. As their breathing hastened, varying degrees of horror appeared in their eyes.They might not be afraid of death, but such an action of being dissected alive and researched was something they had never thought of. Moreover, seeing the outcome of others with their own eyes increased their fear even more.This fear increased even more when they watched Xu Qing. He was completely immersed in his research. He would ponder, then grab some criminals and cut them up. Blood of various colors mixed together on the ground and it was pooling up fast.In the end, some cultivators broke down mentally and hid in the corners. Their gazes toward Xu Qing were filled with incomparable fear and horror.Even the black-clothed girl stopped cursing after Xu Qing dissected the 34th criminal. Her body trembled slightly and a trace of horror appeared in her eyes.The night passed.Xu Qing left early in the morning.He had gained a lot that night and there were already more ideas in his mind. After he left, the disciples of the Homicide Department walked into the prison and their faces turned pale.This place had really become a killing ground.However, after they looked at each other, they didn't clean up.This was because… these nonhuman criminals weren't worthy of their sympathy. They had killed many innocent people. Raping and plundering were common, and some of them even reared humans for meat.The reason why they were kept alive was to use them as cannon fodders when needed.After leaving the Homicide Department, Xu Qing immediately went to the medicinal shop and bought more herbs and poisonous grass. He then returned to the magic ship to continue his research. After midnight, he headed to the prison again.This time around, the moment he walked in, there were no more clamoring or all kinds of disgusting actions. All the criminals instantly trembled and intense fear appeared in their eyes as they looked at Xu Qing who was walking over like an Asura.Xu Qing's expression was calm. As he passed by many cages, his gaze finally landed on the cage beside the black-clothed girl. There was a three-eyed nonhuman cultivator with a scar on his neck.Xu Qing looked at it in surprise. It was vaguely familiar and he recalled that it was one of the Night Dove members. However, he couldn't remember if he had cut the other party before. Amidst the nonhuman cultivator's screams, he grabbed it and scattered medicinal powder before releasing the little black bugs.This night was the same as yesterday.Time slowly passed and very soon, another three days passed.Among the disciples of the Black Division, rumors of Xu Qing's terror began to circulate. As for the criminals in the prison, all of them had died, leaving only the black-clothed girl. The gaze she used to look at Xu Qing contained even more fear."Get the Yellow Division to send the prisoners here." Xu Qing's instructions were quickly carried out. Just like that, the scene continued to be replayed in the Black Division's dungeon.All the nonhuman prisoners who were imprisoned started off with deranged mockery, then horror, and finally trembling in despair.Xu Qing's research on the little black bugs became increasingly thorough. He even added corpse poison, finally causing the number and the threat of those little black bugs to increase greatly.Often, when a wanted criminal from the nonhuman races was invaded by the little bugs, they would turn into bones in the span of a few breaths and their flesh and blood would be completely devoured.However, Xu Qing was still not satisfied."It's very easy to block and guard against the devouring outside. It should be better if they were hidden like poison." Xu Qing informed the Homicide Department to bring the criminals detained by the Earth Division.The one who suffered the greatest blow was the black-clothed girl.Before she met Xu Qing, she didn't know what it felt like to be afraid. However, over these few days, she had seen Xu Qing's various actions. That serious expression and coldness as he searched and studied without any emotions shook her mind greatly.When the prisoners from the Earth Division were brought over, the black-clothed girl watched as Xu Qing waved his hand and a large amount of black fog appeared around his body. Gradually, her body trembled and a rare peculiarity appeared in the depths of the fear in her eyes. Ͳհìʂ çհąքէҽɾ մքӀօąժ ƒìɾʂէ ąէ ղօѵҽӀ-ҍìղ.çօʍ After staring at the side of Xu Qing's face, she bit her finger and stretched it out to Xu Qing. Her expression seemed to ask Xu Qing if he wanted to eat it.Seeing that Xu Qing wasn't paying attention to her, she took her trembling hand back and placed it in her mouth before starting to suck her blood.After a long time, she spoke with a trembling voice."Brother Xu Qing… Can you let me help?"

Chapter 287 Deep Grace Stays In The Dream
Xu Qing didn't bother with her.The little black bugs hadn't met his requirements yet. He was a little dissatisfied with this method of biting from the outside."There are two directions to go. One is to make them bigger and the other is smaller…"Xu Qing chose small.Only then could they kill silently without being detected. Xu Qing adjusted the direction of his research and continued to refine and explore.This feeling of learning and searching for answers made him feel very comfortable.Other than corpse poison, he also added the poisons he had refined in the past two years. These poisons were ordinary now but Xu Qing wanted the black bugs to gain more resistance to poison by devouring them."Once I succeed in refining the poison this time, it will be equivalent to refining my true first poison. Moreover, it's an active poison."Xu Qing felt that compared to the poisons he had refined previously, the one he refined now could be considered quite good.Other than that, he also spent his spirit stones like water during this period, causing his heart to ache endlessly.He had bought a lot of different types of medicinal herbs. He even spared no expense to buy some extremely expensive medicinal herbs to experiment.In the end, he mostly chose poisonous grasses. As he continued to feed the little black bugs, he finally found medicinal herbs that made the little black bugs smaller during the repeated poison testing.This method wasn't perfect. He needed to adjust the dosage and test it. He also needed the poison testers to cooperate with him.However, all the prisoners of the Homicide Department had died. Xu Qing felt that the prisoners of the Heaven Division shouldn't be able to hold on for long as well.This made Xu Qing a little annoyed as he felt that he was in a crucial moment of his research."Should I go out to sea…"Xu Qing fell silent for a moment but gave up on this thought. He took out the voice transmission jade slip and issued a mission to the entire Homicide Department.Very soon, the disciples of the Seventh Peak's Homicide Department rushed out crazily, setting off an unprecedented trend of arrests in the Seventh Peak's port area.All the wanted criminals, as long as they were still in the port area, felt their hearts skip a beat. As wanted criminals were captured wildly, the public security in the entire port area became extremely good.At the same time, seeing that Xu Qing was doing well, the captain wasn't to be outdone. The intelligence department's operations were carried out frequently and spies were caught every day.The captain didn't deal with the small fishes too seriously after recording the punishment. His focus was on the big fishes. Just like that, the atmosphere in the entire port area became positive.Xu Qing and the captain's reputation became even greater in the sect.However, the reputation of the captain was mostly from the term 'mad dog'. As for Xu Qing… he was called a demon!The news that he had used all the prisoners in the Homicide Department to test poison had already spread. To a certain extent, in terms of reputation, Xu Qing was even more terrifying than the captain.Even so, Xu Qing's poison testing was still not over. Hence, he targeted the prisons of the Homicide Departments on the other six mountain peaks. However, he was rejected after negotiation.Only the First Peak's Homicide Department sent some imprisoned nonhuman cultivators over. As such, Xu Qing simply arranged for his subordinates to head to the other districts to capture wanted criminals.Crossing districts to arrest was a taboo, but Xu Qing couldn't care less. When the captain saw Xu Qing like this, he also began to cross districts.The Intelligence Department and Homicide Department of the other six peaks were also anxious, so they quickly launched similar operations in the other districts. The entire Seven Blood Eyes was filled with an intense competitive atmosphere.Another half a month passed. When the Seven Blood Eyes' army stepped into the Sea Corpse Race's territory and started a decisive battle with the Sea Corpse Race, the operations of the Intelligence and Homicide Departments of the Seven Blood Eyes finally came to an end.The main reason was that Xu Qing felt that he had already studied the little black bugs to an extremely deep level and he had even fed them black pills.Their overall number had also increased from half a bottle to five bottles.Each bottle contained countless small black bugs and looked like liquid. These black bugs were smaller than half the size of the previous version Xu Qing had obtained back then.In fact, if only one was released, it would be impossible to see it with the naked eye. However, it was difficult to change their color. They were still black, so once there were too many of them, they would look like black fog.The most important thing was their lethality. After the test, Xu Qing discovered that once these little black bugs infiltrated someone's body, they would instantly reproduce and start devouring the flesh and blood. During this process, they would also emit a vast amount of anomalous substances and poison.Moreover, they were extremely difficult to remove. Once they entered the body, they would seep deep into the body like bone marrow.If he had the current black bugs when he fought with the black-clothed girl before, Xu Qing felt that the black-clothed girl would probably die in a few breaths of time.With such might, Xu Qing felt that they should be able to barely meet his requirements and threaten the Golden Core.However, he felt it a pity that he didn't have a Golden Core poison tester by his side. However, he felt that there was a high chance that they would be of some use against Golden Cores."Moreover, these little black bugs of mine can continue to grow." Xu Qing was very satisfied with this point. It was also the result of his constant research and purchase of medicinal herbs during this period of time."I hope there won't be a day when I really have to test them on a Golden Core." A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. If such a thing happened, it meant that he would have to risk his life.Xu Qing dripped his blood into these five bottles of small black bugs. This was his way of controlling these countless small black bugs.The little black bugs poisoned the enemy, while he poisoned the little black bugs!These little black bugs had to absorb a drop of his blood every once in a while. Otherwise, they would die. The instinct of living creatures caused these little black bugs to protect Xu Qing even though they didn't have any intelligence.Because they would only survive if Xu Qing was alive.Other than that, these little black bugs also needed to eat a large number of medicinal herbs and poisonous grass every day. This was also a method of raising them and the expenditure was extremely high. Xu Qing had felt that he was very rich previously, but now he realized he was still poor.However, he had another additional gain, and that was the black-clothed girl.The other party was still imprisoned in the Black Division but she no longer cursed. She sat in her cell quietly and occasionally, when new prisoners came and Xu Qing went over to test the poison, she would stare at him. The peculiarity in her eyes grew stronger and stronger.She had mentioned many times that she wanted to help, and from her expression, Xu Qing could tell that she was saying it sincerely.This made Xu Qing feel a little strange. At the same time, the large decrease in spirit stones made him a little nervous. As for his profits from the port, it would still take some time. After all, the constructions and all the works in the port expended a large number of spirit stones.As such, Xu Qing thought of the magic artifacts that the Diamond Sect's ancestor had absorbed and turned into fake magic artifacts. He wondered if he should find a black market to sell them.While Xu Qing was weighing this matter, a red jade slip was teleported from the battlefield to the Seventh Peak's Intelligence Department!The red jade slip represented an extremely important matter!Only the Peak Lords could send it out. No matter how far the battlefield was, these red slips would immediately reach the designated location in the sect.So far, the red jade slips had only been issued three times in this wartime. Every time, it concerned a huge strategic opportunity that required the cooperation of the sect.However, this time… it had nothing to do with war. It was Old Master Seventh who sent it.After the captain received it, he swept his divine sense over and his expression changed drastically. After a long time, he placed the apple in his hand to the side. He then stood up and wanted to look for Xu Qing.However, he hesitated. In the end, he let out a long sigh and still headed straight for Xu Qing's magic ship.When the captain found Xu Qing, Xu Qing was organizing those magic artifacts. He had decided to sell these magic artifacts.Xu Qing originally didn't think much of the captain's sudden visit, but he stopped when he saw the solemn expression on the captain's face."Captain?""Xu Qing." The captain hesitated for a moment. He looked at Xu Qing and hesitated to speak.Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and stared at the captain. He faintly felt that something was amiss."Xu Qing, the old man has arranged a mission for me." After a few breaths of silence, determination appeared in the captain's eyes as he spoke in a low voice."This mission requires me to leave the Seven Blood Eyes and make a trip to Purple Earth. It's very urgent. The old man can't leave the battlefield; otherwise, he would have gone himself. The old man also asked me to ask you if you wanted to do this mission yourself?"Xu Qing's expression was gloomy. He naturally knew who the old man the captain was talking about was."Captain, there's no need to be so secretive. What's the matter?"The captain cast a deep glance at Xu Qing and handed the red jade slip to him.Xu Qing took it. After his magic power surged in, a piece of information appeared in his mind."My close friend, Grandmaster Bai, was assassinated in Purple Earth this morning…"When Xu Qing read this, he felt like a lightning bolt had struck him. His body became a little unsteady and he took a few steps back.His face turned pale before color appeared again. The veins on his forehead bulged and the hand that was holding the jade slip trembled slightly.He seemed to be trying his best to control himself as he tried to calm his hurried breathing.A deep sense of unreality hit his mind and he closed his eyes.In the pitch-black world in front of him, a tent seemed to have appeared. An aged and hoarse voice spread with dignity. "Kid, you answer!""Kid, from now on, you don't have to stand outside or take those messy medicinal herbs. From tomorrow onwards, you can enter the tent to listen to the lesson." Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "Know that the world is the guest house of all living beings. Time is a passerby from ancient times until now. As long as we don't die, we will meet again. I hope that the day I see you again will be the day you become a talent."In the pitch-black world, this tent shattered and turned into ashes, disappearing from Xu Qing's sight. Only the last sentence still echoed in his ears, becoming eternal."As long as we don't die, we'll meet again eventually." Xu Qing mumbled hoarsely and slowly opened his eyes.Grandmaster Bai was the first teacher who had truly changed his life.

Chapter 288 Pursuing The Culprit To Purple Earth
It was noon now. The sky should be bright but Xu Qing felt that the world wasn't that bright anymore.Port 176 was clearly bustling with activity but in Xu Qing's perception, all sounds seemed to have disappeared.That intense surreal feeling made him feel that everything was like a joke. The crowd walking past in the distance, the birds flying in the sky, the sounds of boats coming from the sea. Everything seemed to be isolated from his perception.It was as though in his perception, the world had been divided into two layers. The first layer was the entire world and everyone. As for the other layer… there was only him.It was too sudden.Very few people could accept such sudden news immediately, and very few people could react instantly. Xu Qing staggered and grabbed the railing of the magic ship tightly.The sea breeze blew over, blowing his black hair up, but it couldn't blow away the stifling sensation that was rapidly forming in his chest. He wanted to roar and scream, but he couldn't.Xu Qing attached great importance to gratitude."Meet again eventually?…" Xu Qing mumbled.He recalled the past when he was searching for the heavenfate flower in the scavenger campsite. He recalled Grandmaster Bai's deep gaze in the tent, and the scene of him holding other plants and asking guiltily.Finally, the image of Grandmaster Bai sitting on the departing carriage and smiling at him appeared in his mind.Now, everything was gone.Captain Lei gave Xu Qing the feeling of family.Grandmaster Bai gave Xu Qing a debt of gratitude as heavy as a mountain.These two old men could be said to have pulled back the youth who had walked out of the city that was like purgatory under the blood rain and corpses when the god's fragmented face opened its eyes.However, the world was heartless and cruel.Life was worthless in this world.After Xu Qing entered the Seven Blood Eyes, what he experienced was no longer as desolate as the scavenger campsite. Instead, the cruelty was displayed in another way.Regardless of whether it was selling children for food or cruel torture, it was a constant occurrence in this world.Killing intent continuously erupted in Xu Qing's heart. It was as though a sharp blade had appeared in his body and was crazily emitting monstrous killing intent, wanting to break through his body and slash the world.Xu Qing's body trembled.After a long time, Xu Qing took a deep breath and looked at the captain who had a worried expression on his face. His voice came out hoarsely."I'm fine."As Xu Qing spoke, he forced himself to calm down as he checked the red slip again.Old Master Seventh clearly possessed a wide range of connections and abilities. Hence, not only did his jade slip inform him of Grandmaster Bai's death, but it also contained clues from Purple Earth and information about the murderer.As for the true reason for the murder, no one knew yet. However, the jade slip mentioned that after Grandmaster Bai was assassinated, nothing was missing from his possessions or his residence, other than the second volume of a pill formula called the Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill.This was a pill formula that had been obtained from a wish box many years ago. It came from the previous era and was recorded on an unknown beast skin. The pill described in it was utterly heartless and extremely vicious.The main ingredient for the Lunar Chosen Transformation Pill was heaven's chosen. With three of them as one ingredient, one needed to refine six ingredients at the same time to form a blood pill.Swallowing this could allow the mortal to defy the heavens and transform into a heaven's chosen.Grandmaster Bai obtained the second volume in a fortuitous encounter and felt that this pill was too vicious. He originally wanted to destroy it but because it still had a certain value in terms of pill knowledge, he kept it. Not many outsiders knew about it.As for the murderer's exact identity, Purple Earth was also investigating. Old Master Seventh couldn't know more details but with his connections in Purple Earth, he still found some clues.The murderer wasn't a human but a rare race of bizarre entities in the Forbidden Sea called the Bizarre Fiend Race.This race was known as the undying race. It wasn't that they couldn't die but their strange abilities made it almost impossible for outsiders to capture and kill them completely. This was because every time they died, they would immediately revive in the creature they had marked before.​ Although this revival consumed some energy, it wasn't much.This caused a lot of trouble for Purple Earth in their investigation. In addition… the situation in Purple Earth was complicated. The various families were fighting openly and covertly over benefits. When Grandmaster Bai was alive, he was extremely valued and countless people benefited from him.However, he wasn't a cultivator after all. He was just a mortal, an old man in his twilight years.No matter how great a mortal's contributions were, in the eyes of cultivators, especially those stubborn people in power in Purple Earth, they were inferior.They were just tools.Hence, after Grandmaster Bai died, although Purple Earth was enraged and investigated, they clearly didn't put too much effort. Even those who had received Grandmaster Bai's kindness didn't make a move.The relationships are gone after the people leave, especially in this cruel chaotic world.However, they still blocked all teleportation from Purple Earth to the outside world. They also notified the Litu Sect, the Truth Sect, and the Seven Blood Eyes to seal the teleportation as well.After doing all this, Purple Earth's focus was almost all on Grandmaster Bai's alchemy inheritance. Even the Bai family showed ambiguity in this matter. A portion of them wanted revenge, while another portion began to divide the spoils.This was Purple Earth.It was also the reason why Purple Earth, who was clearly a true native of the Nanhuang Continent, could only become one of the forces now. Their stubbornness and isolated nature were deeply rooted.That was why Old Master Seventh sent the red jade slip. He couldn't rush back himself and handed this matter to the captain. This was because in the entire Nanhuang Continent, the only one who understood the Forbidden Sea the most was the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes.They were much more proficient at searching and tracking the nonhuman races on the Forbidden Sea."Usually, it's impossible for there to be too many murderers in such an assassination. Coupled with the characteristics of the Bizarre Fiend Race, there's a high chance that there's only one culprit. Moreover, his cultivation shouldn't be at the Golden Core Realm.""This is because Purple Earth's array formation suppresses and restricts foreign Golden Cores extremely severely. If the nonhuman Golden Cores go over, the possibility of them being exposed will far exceed that of Foundation Building cultivators who aren't much of a concern.""Therefore, Purple Earth has made a similar request to the Seven Blood Eyes; there is no need to investigate the Golden Cores. If I were to go, I would search for anomalous substances that contain the aura of the Forbidden Sea and combine them with some special magic artifacts to screen them. This process might take some time. Also, I'm not sure how long Purple Earth's lockdown will last.""After all… there are many families in Purple Earth. The Bai family is only one of them."The captain looked at Xu Qing and spoke softly."I'll go." Xu Qing lifted his head and calmly spoke.There were no emotions in this sentence, but the captain could sense that it contained a storm that was about to erupt!"Xu Qing, I can open a hidden teleportation gate for you to return later. After you find the murderer, you can reach there and teleport back. The main point of catching the murderer is…""The main point is to find the mastermind." Xu Qing soared into the air and waved his right hand. As the sea rumbled, his magic ship shone and was put away by Xu Qing. He immediately headed straight for the Seven Blood Eyes' teleportation array.Although everything was sealed, it was still possible to carry out a one-directional teleportation with the jade slip.At that moment, killing intent and anxiety coexisted in Xu Qing's heart. They continued to fuse together, forming an even deeper pressure in his chest, causing him to speed up.The whistling sound caused by his speed eruption caused the hearts of everyone in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city to tremble.At the next instant, Xu Qing's figure appeared at the location of the Seven Blood Eyes' teleportation array. The moment he landed, he was already standing in the teleportation array."Purple Earth's capital city!" Xu Qing was expressionless as he spoke in a low voice.The disciple in charge of the teleportation recognized Xu Qing's identity and immediately began to adjust the array. Three breaths later, as the teleportation array shone, Xu Qing's figure instantly disappeared.The teleportation fluctuations spread in all directions. As Xu Qing disappeared, the captain also sped over.Standing outside the teleportation array, he looked into the distance and let out a long sigh.Regarding the matter between Xu Qing and Grandmaster Bai, he had read it in the dossier after he became the director of the Intelligence Department. He also knew that the old man had played a huge role in this.  𝕋𝕙𝕚𝕤 𝕔𝕙𝕒𝕡𝕥𝕖𝕣 𝕦𝕡𝕝𝕠𝕒𝕕 𝕗𝕚𝕣𝕤𝕥 𝕒𝕥 𝕟𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕝-𝕓𝕚𝕟.𝕔𝕠𝕞 It was the old man who recommended Xu Qing, and Grandmaster Bai had also finally acknowledged Xu Qing.Hence, the captain knew that it wasn't good for him to participate in this matter.This was because he felt that Xu Qing didn't want others to participate either."Back then… I felt the same thing. At that time, I only wanted to be alone." Memories appeared in the captain's eyes and a hint of sadness seemed to rise in the depths of his heart. However, it was suppressed the next instant.He looked around and smiled."Everyone, the Intelligence Department has requisitioned this place."As his voice rang out, the Seven Blood Eyes' teleportation array quickly became empty and was controlled by the disciples of the Intelligence Department. After that, the captain took a deep breath and looked at the sky."With my status as the third rank in the Sequence of the Seventh Peak and the position of the director of the Seventh Peak's Intelligence Department, I apply for the sect's array formation to close all the teleportation arrays of the Seven Blood Eyes and seal the ports.""Make all the boats and ships unable to leave or enter the harbor."As the captain's voice rang out, the entire Seven Blood Eyes' array formation rumbled. Very soon, a divine sense came from the Sixth Peak.The captain cupped his fists and bowed to the Sixth Peak."Sixth Martial Uncle, I have some evidence and guesses. I might be able to find out about Senior Brother Chen's murder back then. Please permit me to seal the sect!"The Sixth Peak suddenly erupted with monstrous might, causing the sky to change color and the wind and clouds to surge. A long time later, a low voice rang out."Permitted!"The captain lowered his head and bowed deeply, muttering inwardly."Little Qing, this is all I can do for you. I hope you can successfully investigate this matter. This matter… gives me the feeling that it's not simple.""Lunar Chosen Refinement Pill?""In the past few years, there have been many heaven's chosen who disappeared on the sea…"The captain narrowed his eyes, his gaze deep.
