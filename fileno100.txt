The life-and-death crisis caused the King Kong Sect's ancestor to feel even more frenzied. At that moment, while he was being entangled, at the edge of the region with dense anomalous substances, there was a crack on the ground next to a wall.At that moment, Xu Qing was carefully hiding in the crack, warily looking at the outside world through the gap.Back then, when he was in this ruined city, he followed the trail of the flying bird and discovered two safe shelters. One was his stone cave and the other... was this gap!This gap was also the place where he had obtained the cultivation art from the city lord's residence. After his chest was heavily injured, he dodged the mutated beasts' pursuit.However, this place was too close to the city lord's residence, so Xu Qing didn't choose this place as a temporary residence back then.Under the calamity when the gods opened their eyes, it was difficult for all living beings to escape destruction. Only the birds... For some reason, most of them survived.At the same time, they seemed to be able to find some locations instinctively. Although it wasn't absolutely safe, it was like a blind spot and it was easy for mutated beasts and bizarre creatures to overlook it.Of course, this was only relative. If the King Kong Sect's ancestor wasn't here to attract his attention, then Xu Qing's actions earlier would be akin to courting death.At that moment, when he saw the sorry state of the Sect's ancestor and noticed the gigantic figure struggling to climb out of the giant pit in the city lord's residence, Xu Qing also took a deep breath. However, he quickly gritted his teeth and rushed out with a sway of his body, throwing the black pill toward the Sect's ancestor who was being chased in the distance.He threw out another ten-odd pills in one go.The black pills landed on the ground and exploded one after another. The anomalous substances here were already astonishingly dense. At that moment, as the black pills exploded, they seemed to have broken through a certain critical point.In the blink of an eye, all the malicious gazes that had gathered on Xu Qing after he left the spatial rift shifted away. All of them looked toward the area with denser anomalous substances. At the same time, at many locations in the city, regardless of whether it was mutated beasts or bizarre creatures, they all stopped and looked over in unison.At the next moment, he sped off!He let out an extremely furious roar. At the same time, Xu Qing didn't even turn his head as he crouched down and sprinted. He wanted to make use of the opportunity when the mutated beasts and bizarre creatures were attracted by the anomalous substances to flee at full speed. The King Kong Sect's ancestor also wanted to flee but those winged figures were entangled with him. Even if he wanted to retreat, he would inevitably be slowed down. At that moment, anxiety filled his heart. The hatred in his heart for Xu Qing was incomparably intense.At that moment, Xu Qing's speed was getting faster and faster on the streets in the distance. Just as he was about to head in the direction of the city wall after pulling away from the city lord's residence, a cold and sinister aura gushed over him.In front of him, the sound of crying echoed. A faceless woman in a white dress walked over from afar. At the first glance, the other party was still far away. However, at a second glance, this strange figure had already appeared in front of Xu Qing.It was so fast that Xu Qing couldn't dodge at all. At that moment, his breathing was hurried and his pupils contracted. His body was instantly covered in ice and his mind instantly went blank as though it was frozen.As for the faceless woman who was walking over, densely-packed faces rapidly appeared on her body. All of them were crying mournfully and their cries transmitted into Xu Qing's mind, transforming into fluctuations. This caused Xu Qing's expression to be affected and change uncontrollably. He was about to cry like those faces.However, at that moment... a portion of the faceless men's faces suddenly stopped crying. They looked at Xu Qing listlessly and their expressions gradually changed. They slowly revealed a smile and opened their mouths as though they were saying something but no sound came out.Very soon, more and more faces stopped crying. In the end, almost half of the faces of the faceless woman in the white dress stopped crying. They all looked at Xu Qing and revealed smiles, their expressions turning gentle.Their lips moved slightly as though they were speaking softly, saying two words that no one else could hear.As they smiled and mouthed the words, Xu Qing was completely stunned. He stared blankly at the many faces on the giant faceless woman.Before he could see it clearly, the faceless woman in the white dress moved her body away and walked past him. After she was far away, the sound of crying echoed again...Xu Qing's stiff body also recovered at this moment. His breathing hastened as he turned his head abruptly. He stared blankly at the faceless woman in the white dress who was walking further and further away. Her white figure was like a ball of burning fire in the dark night...Earlier, those smiling faces... Xu Qing found them very familiar.It was as though he knew them... n(ovelbin[.]nEt This was especially so for one of them. He recalled that it was the old man from the medicine shop whom he had carried and burned to allow him to rest in peace.Xu Qing was silent. He looked at the departing figure and vaguely understood something. After a long time, he lowered his head and bowed deeply as he muttered softly."Thank you."Those smiling faces from before also said the same word."Thank you."

Chapter ﻿72 Vengeful Look
The arrival of the god's fragmented face was like the awakening of cicadas, affecting the growth of all things and forcing them to change.This change made the world cruel and cold.The formation of the forbidden zone caused the coldness to reach an extreme. However, at that moment… Xu Qing stared at the white-clothed figure who had left. He suddenly thought of something Captain Lei had said back then."Do you know why I proposed to take you away twice from the ruins of the city?""I saw the silhouette of you cremating the corpses. At that time, the fire illuminated you while you were standing beside the blaze. You looked like you had fused with the fire. It made me feel as though I have seen… a trace of warmth in this cruel world."Xu Qing fell silent.At that moment, just like Captain Lei back then, he also felt a hint of warmth.It came from the faceless woman in the white dress and the many faces who smiled and thanked him.It came from… the humanity that even this cruel world couldn't take away.After a long time, Xu Qing bowed deeply again.After that, he turned and sped toward the distant city wall. …Perhaps it was because he had thrown too many black pills previously, the anomalous substances in the city lord's residence area became extremely dense and broke through the critical point. It was like flames in the night, attracting countless gazes and attention.Or maybe it was his karma with this city.Hence, Xu Qing, who was currently speeding away, didn't encounter much danger. He successfully arrived at the city wall.Standing there, Xu Qing turned his head and glanced at the city in the dark. He then heard roars and mournful cries from afar. He silently stared at them for a long time."I wonder when the next time will be…" Xu Qing mumbled. He then cast his gaze toward the dark city before turning and leaping off the city wall, speeding into the distance.To increase his speed, he took out the flying talisman he had obtained and pasted it on his leg. After the spirit energy surged into his body, his speed erupted explosively and he directly soared into the air.He whistled through the air and left.As the wind blew onto his face, Xu Qing felt a little uncomfortable. This sudden burst of speed and flight also took him a long time to get used to. This was especially so for flying. It was the first time in his life.The feeling of flying in the sky, the feeling of lowering his head to look at the earth with the world under his feet made Xu Qing feel a little dazed.He felt as though he had become the surviving birds spreading their wings in the sky after the god opened its eyes."So this is what it feels like for a bird to fly in the sky." Xu Qing mumbled, trying his best to control his body.As for him who had reached the seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art, he could already control his body perfectly. Hence, Xu Qing quickly got used to this state of soaring in the air.Coupled with his speed and strength, he would step out fiercely from time to time after landing on the ground. He then punched backwards in the air, causing his speed to be even faster.From afar, he looked like a long rainbow as he sped through the air above the forbidden zone.If it was someone else, they would still have to worry about the influx of anomalous substances. However, to Xu Qing, he didn't have to worry about this. Hence, his speed could continue to increase.Not long later, he saw the boundary of the forbidden zone from afar. With a dash, his entire person charged out of the forbidden zone.The instant he arrived in the outside world, the warm wind blew on his body, dispelling the chill in the forbidden zone.Standing in mid-air, Xu Qing was silent. He lifted his head and looked in the direction of Antler City before turning his head to scan another direction.After living at the scavenger campsite for half a year, Xu Qing knew a lot of things. He also understood the area he lived in. This allowed him to know the names and locations of many nearby cities, including the King Kong Sect's mountain gate.At that moment, although the sky was still dark, the ground wasn't completely pitch-black under the illumination of the moonlight. One could faintly see the undulating mountains in the distance.Xu Qing, who was standing in the air, shifted his gaze several times between Antler City and the King Kong Sect."I can't accept this." Xu Qing mumbled.He didn't know what would happen to the King Kong Sect's ancestor who had fallen into the ruined city.However, Xu Qing felt that there was a high chance that the other party wouldn't die. Nevertheless, it was inevitable for him to be in a sorry state and suffer heavy injuries. Also, the possibility of him escaping in a short period of time wasn't high.Right now, if he were to head to Antler City, everything should go smoothly. However, he felt very uncomfortable leaving just like that.Hence, after a few breaths of silence, a cold glint appeared in the youth's eyes. With a sway of his body, he unleashed his full speed. Amidst the intense fluctuations emitted by the flight talisman, he headed straight for… the King Kong Sect.Xu Qing didn't choose to head to Antler City immediately. He wanted to make a trip to the King Kong Sect.He was prepared to take advantage of the fact that the King Kong Sect's ancestor was trapped and the two elders were dead. The entire Sect was in an unprecedented state of weakness, so he wanted to go there and take revenge on the other party's pursuit.This was Xu Qing's personality.If it was anyone else, their first choice would probably be to leave. However, Xu Qing's experiences since he was young made him understand that the hidden danger had to be erased.Even if this hidden danger exceeded the scope of his solution and couldn't be erased in a short period of time, he still had to make the other party feel pain as much as possible.This pain could only become a form of deterrence when it reached a certain level. Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 This was the law of survival in the slums and also the law of scavengers. As for whether it was the law of this chaotic world, Xu Qing didn't know but this was his law.After killing the two elders, Xu Qing felt that the deterrence wasn't enough.At that moment, Xu Qing was speeding toward the King Kong Sect. When the first rays of the sun rose into the sky and shone on the ground, Xu Qing saw his destination from afar.The mountain gate of the King Kong Sect! The Sect was built on top of a mountain peak, surrounded by numerous buildings. Under the sunlight, the main hall at the top of the mountain seemed to be emitting a glow. From afar, it looked extraordinarily imposing.It was just that most of the cultivators in the sect had gone out to search and hadn't returned yet. Hence, there weren't many disciples guarding the mountain gate. In the early morning, he occasionally saw figures.Their expressions were filled with arrogance, as though their presence here represented their supreme status. Among them, there were three to five disciples chatting and laughing beside the arched bridge at the mountain gate.Their talk was mostly related to the fact that the ancestor had gone out to search for the child. What they expressed was that they felt that the ancestor was making a mountain out of a molehill.Some were sitting cross-legged and cultivating in their respective residences.As for the sect master, he was currently sitting in the main hall. He held a book in his hand that recorded the accounts of the offerings in the nearby cities and campsites. His expression was indifferent as he flipped through it.Just like the disciples outside, he didn't think much of the ancestor's departure."He's just a scavenger. Even if he has some capabilities, the two elders are enough to suppress him. There's no need for the ancestor to personally take action. The sect is going to be empty now."The Sect Master shook his head and thought to himself that there was nothing he could do about this. No one dared to disobey the words of the old ancestor.Just when the entire sect was in a state of laziness, Xu Qing, who was high up in the sky and nobody noticed, lowered his head and cast a cold glance.He first sensed the direction of the wind, then circled around to the area with the downwind to measure the wind speed and the distance it could travel.In the end, he chose a location and didn't give the King Kong Sect cultivators any chance to react. He then took out a large amount of poison powder and expressionlessly scattered them one by one.Xu Qing had a lot of poison powder on him. At that moment, he used 80% of it.With so much poison powder mixed together, the toxicity was already extremely shocking. At that moment, the poison powder drifted toward the King Kong Sect in the wind.Xu Qing didn't act immediately but waited.Time flowed by bit by bit. Because there was too much poison powder, when it spread out in the wind, the sky slowly seemed to be dyed in color. At the moment when it vaguely turned into a black wind, a cold glint flashed in Xu Qing's eyes."It's about time."The appearance of this black wind quickly attracted the attention of the King Kong Sect cultivators.The first people who saw were the few chatting disciples at the mountain gate. They lifted their heads in surprise and were stunned when they saw the Black Wind."What's that?"However, at the next instant, when a wisp of black wind blew past a tree in the distance, causing it to instantly wither, the expressions of these few disciples changed drastically."Poison!!"As cries of surprise rang out, the disciples in the sect who discovered this scene were all shaken. One after another, figures rapidly walked out of the sect. All of their expressions changed and they were just about to cast a spell to disperse the poison wind.However, at that moment, Xu Qing's figure suddenly rushed out from the sky. His speed was so fast that he transformed into a bolt of lightning that sprinted toward the Sect's mountain gate.From afar, his figure was like a bolt of lightning that fell into the human world, directly charging into the Sect.Amidst the shock and anger of those King Kong Sect cultivators as the alarm bell of the entire sect rang out, the rumbling sound spread in all directions and Xu Qing suddenly landed on the ground.He was located halfway up the mountain of the King Kong Sect.A loud bang rang out from the ground and numerous cracks spread out. Xu Qing, who was inside, abruptly lifted his head. His gaze was filled with intense killing intent as he directly charged toward the many King Kong Sect cultivators who had shocked expressions on their faces!A loud bang erupted.Xu Qing's attacks were swift and fierce and his speed was astonishing. Everywhere he passed by, miserable cries would ring out and corpses would scatter everywhere.However, even though there weren't many disciples in the King Kong Sect, there were still some.Hence, very soon, amidst waves of furious roars, numerous figures gathered from all directions and rushed toward Xu Qing."Enemy attack!""Damn it, someone actually dared to attack our King Kong Sect!"Kill him!At that moment, the Sect Master in the main hall also sensed it. He quickly walked out in shock and anger. He saw the chaos in the sect and the poisonous wind that spread out."All disciples, consume the poison-repelling pills immediately and dispel the poison wind!" His expression suddenly changed as he quickly ordered the sect.At the same time, he locked onto the location of the explosion halfway up the mountain. His eyes were filled with coldness as he immediately rushed over.However, Xu Qing's attack was incomparably fast. He didn't tangle with these King Kong Sect disciples but walked around and waved his hand, tossing out black pills one after another.Some of these black pills landed on the ground and some were still in the air. However, they exploded at the same time, forming a vortex that attracted anomalous substances. This caused the anomalous substances that were everywhere in the world to seem to have come alive and were instantly attracted over."Anomalous substances!!" When the surrounding King Kong Sect disciples who wanted to rush over sensed this scene, their expressions changed and they instinctively retreated. However, there were still a few people who were at the center of the vortex. Under these dense anomalous substances, their bodies quickly turned greenish-black."How dare you!!" A furious roar rang out from the direction of the main hall on the mountain peak. The figure of the King Kong Sect's Sect Master suddenly arrived.His cultivation fluctuations at the perfected Qi Condensation Realm surpassed the elder Xu Qing had killed. This was the second strongest expert in the King Kong Sect other than the old ancestor.At this moment, his golden robe was bulging and his expression was gloomy. The killing intent in his eyes was intense. However, after seeing Xu Qing's scavenger attire and age, his entire body trembled."It's you!" He didn't need to guess as he already had an answer in his heart.The moment this answer appeared, a huge wave rose in the heart of the King Kong Sect's Sect Master.

Chapter ﻿73 Burning The King Kong Sect Master (1)
"Why are you here?!" The eyes of the King Kong Sect's Sect Master suddenly narrowed. Waves of emotions surged violently in his heart and he felt disbelief.At that moment, the youth he was looking at was wearing a black leather coat. His hair was very messy and his face was dirty. It was just that… the color of the leather coat revealed dried blood stains that carried a baleful aura.Although the messy hair and dirt on his face covered his face, the poison wind blew over and lifted his hair, revealing his eyes that couldn't be concealed.At that moment, the sharpness and indescribable coldness in his eyes were exceptionally obvious even in the fog with dense anomalous substances.The instant their gazes met, a chill rose in the heart of the King Kong Sect's Sect Master."Kid!!"Even though he had never seen Xu Qing's portrait before, at that instant, the nickname of the scavenger appeared in the mind of the King Kong Sect's Sect Master.He knew that the ancestor, two elders and a large number of disciples were chasing after this person. However, now… the ancestor and elders didn't return but this kid who was being chased actually appeared in the sect.This scene caused the Sect Master to be filled with extreme terror. However, he didn't have time to think too much at this moment. He quickly performed a series of hand seals and in an instant, a storm swept out in all directions. As the poisonous wind was dispersed, the airwave formed by the storm also headed straight for Xu Qing.Xu Qing coldly swept his gaze over and didn't bother with the Sect Master. His body retreated and dodged the attack in the blink of an eye. He then changed directions and sped off furiously, throwing out more black pills.A rumbling sound suddenly echoed out. The Sect Master sensed the strangeness of the black pill and his expression changed once again. He stomped his feet fiercely and chased after Xu Qing, wanting to stop him.However, Xu Qing didn't fight with him and dodged once again. He borrowed the speed of the flying talisman and continued to move around the sect, forcing the Sect Master to use the flying talisman as well.From afar, the Sect Master and Xu Qing were one behind the other. Wherever they passed, rumbling sounds rang out incessantly.There were also black pills that were continuously thrown out by Xu Qing amidst the rumbling sounds."Damn it!" The Sect Master's anger rose and he wanted to stop him. However, the two of them had used their flying talismans so their speed was actually on par. This made it impossible for him to catch up quickly.Hence, very soon, amidst the rumbling sounds, more and more vortices formed by the black pills appeared. The density of anomalous substances also rapidly reached an astonishing level and they gradually approached the forbidden zone.When Xu Qing had very few black pills left, the entire King Kong Sect… directly transformed into a gigantic vortex.This vortex continued to spin, causing endless anomalous substances to surge over. Even the sky was covered and when the anomalous substances became extremely dense, they formed a fog that churned more and more. It was as though the sky was blotted out, enveloping the surroundings.​ From afar, the King Kong Sect, which was covered in fog, was filled with roars and exclamations. All the disciples inside were incomparably shocked at this moment.At the same time, due to the lack of manpower, although a portion of the poison wind was dispersed, more poison powder followed the wind and completely arrived at this moment. It covered the heavens and the earth, blowing into the King Kong Sect's mountain gate and fusing with the fog.  Best n0vel online free at 🇫​🇷​🇴​🇲​ 𝓃ℴ𝓋ℯ𝓁𝒷𝒾𝓃 Everywhere it passed by, all plants and trees withered instantly. Even the mountain rocks emitted sizzling sounds as though they were being corroded.At this moment, a tragic cry echoed out.The entire King Kong Sect was incomparably tragic. Dense anomalous substances pervaded the air, polluting everything. The poisonous powder blended into the wind and covered all areas. Coupled with the anomalous substances, it formed a great terror.All of this happened in the span of a hundred breaths. The speed was so fast that it was hard for one to react. For a time, the King Kong Sect fell into chaos.A portion of the disciples scrambled to escape but the poison here was too intense. Even though they had consumed the antidote, it was still of little use. Very soon, blood flowed out of their seven orifices and they wailed miserably.There was also a portion that rapidly hid but it was useless.Other than that, the remaining ones chased after Xu Qing under the sect master's furious roar.However, at that moment, the sect was in chaos and Xu Qing's speed was very fast. He took advantage of the chaos and disappeared without a trace after a few shakes. The others were about to search for him but at that moment, flames shone not far away.This scene caused the scalps of everyone in the surroundings to turn numb. The Sect Master was even more shocked. He couldn't be bothered to chase after Xu Qing and immediately summoned his disciples to extinguish the fire.However… the flames weren't coming from a single location. Very soon, one fire after another appeared in the sect and the raging flames began to burn."Kid!!" The King Kong Sect's Sect Master let out a mournful cry. His hatred had reached the extreme but he couldn't find it in a short period of time. He could only put out the fire with all his might.At the same time, Xu Qing's figure swiftly stepped into one of the luxurious buildings within the Sect's mountain gate. After he entered and took away all the items he could loot, he set the place on fire and left quickly.The entire process was very fast. Not long later, amidst the chaos, Xu Qing arrived before a building that was more luxurious. He then saw the words on the signboard."Treasure Pavilion?" Xu Qing's eyes narrowed. When he got close, he lifted his right hand and punched out.At that moment, the door of the treasure vault shattered and the poisonous fog from the outside world gushed in. Xu Qing then stepped in and saw rows of shelves inside.On the shelves were all sorts of medicinal pills, spirit coins, and treasures.Xu Qing swept his gaze over and his heart pounded wildly. He immediately went up and took everything he could with him. After looting, he was about to leave.However, his eyes narrowed as he noticed that in the Treasure Pavilion, the poisonous fog had seeped into the walls through some invisible gaps, vaguely forming the shape of a door. It was as though there was a hidden door there.

Chapter ﻿74 Burning The Diamond Sect Master (2)
Hence, Xu Qing raised his brows and directly kicked out. With a boom, cracks appeared on the secret door but it didn't shatter.Xu Qing let out a soft cry of surprise as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. Cracking sounds then rang out from his body and the kui shadow behind him suddenly materialized. As he silently roared, it fused with his right hand, transforming into a full-powered punch.With a boom, the hidden door shattered into pieces, revealing a dark room.There weren't many items inside, only a palm-sized cloth bag.Xu Qing was a little surprised and wanted to grab it.However, at that moment, an intense light emitted from the bottom of the sack. Streaks of light drew complicated patterns on the ground. As they shone, they formed wind blades that spiralled into the air, blocking the hand he grabbed.Xu Qing immediately retracted his hand and looked at the cloth bag within the wind blades. A strange glint appeared in his eyes. He felt that this thing must be a treasure, so he glanced at the picture formed by the light under the cloth bag."What is this?" Xu Qing frowned. After sensing the spirit energy fluctuations on it, he let out a cold snort. He then took out his two remaining black pills and crushed them.Instantaneously, anomalous substances erupted and gushed in from all directions, engulfing the secret chamber. The pattern that lit up on the ground flickered intensely at this moment but it couldn't stop the corrosion. Eventually, it dimmed and was extinguished amidst cracking sounds.Xu Qing didn't hesitate to grab the sack and leave the treasure vault.Xu Qing's expression was ice-cold as he looked at the Diamond Sect, which was currently in a state of chaos and filled with wails. It was filled with anomalous substances and poisonous wind and flames were rising from it. His flight talisman flashed as he soared into the air, wanting to leave.He was very clear that even if the Sect didn't have an ancestor now, he had only gained the advantage of a surprise attack. If this continued, there would be danger.His goal in coming here this time wasn't simply to kill but to destroy the Diamond Sect's mountain gate. He wanted to snatch as much as he could. Now that he had achieved his goal, his speed erupted as he rushed toward the sky.However, at that moment, a furious roar rang out. Within the fog, the Sect Master's hair was dishevelled as he rapidly rushed toward him.Xu Qing was in mid-air. He lowered his head and killing intent flashed in his eyes. The seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art erupted from his body and the kui shadow appeared behind him. He then threw a punch toward the incoming Sect Master.A heaven-shattering sound rang out. The Sect Master roared as he retreated a few steps. Just when he was about to continue, a purple saber shadow formed behind Xu Qing in the next instant.The heavenly saber descended.It directly slashed at the Diamond Sect's Sect Master.  Best novel online free at ղօѵҽlճíղ  The expression of the Sect Master changed drastically and his body suddenly retreated, returning to the poisonous wind and anomalous substances in the fog. At the same time, the purple blade light also chased after him.Xu Qing didn't give chase. His gaze flickered as he immediately retreated, transforming into a beam of light that shot into the sky, heading toward the distant thunder.The instant he left, seven to eight figures rushed out of the fog that the Sect Master had retreated into. Each of them attacked fiercely with all their might.The power of this attack was so great that it seemed to cause the air to explode. A thunderous boom filled the sky and a depression was formed, comparable to the power of a Foundation Building.If Xu Qing hadn't left and continued to pursue, he would have been blasted into pieces.As for the seven or eight figures, they were all old men. At that moment, their faces were all pale and they spat out mouthfuls of blood. It was obvious that the attack earlier had been completed through their cooperation and secret arts.Now that they saw Xu Qing escaping, they hesitated on whether they should chase after him."Seven Guardians, don't chase after them." Within the fog, the Sect Master staggered out. One of his arms was broken and as blood dripped down, his face was pale and his body was on the verge of collapse."That thief is too cautious. To think that he didn't pursue me. Right now, our main focus is to disperse the poisonous wind and anomalous substances from the mountain gate as soon as possible and wait for the ancestor to return!"The Sect Master was filled with grievances and gritted his teeth. He had risked being injured earlier to lure the other party but he had failed.The seven or eight old men fell silent. Someone stepped forward to support the sect master. Looking at the chaotic sect, their expressions were blank. They sighed and could only try their best to disperse the chaos.Time flowed and very soon, a day passed.When dusk arrived, more than half of the Diamond Sect's poison and anomalous substances had finally dissipated. The former consumed a large amount of the disciples' wind-element spells, while the latter... forced them to crush their spirit coins and dilute them with pure spirit energy. The consumption was tremendous.As for the entire sect... it was in ruins. Even the main hall at the top of the mountain was in ruins. Most of the buildings had collapsed and there were traces of fire everywhere.If they wanted to recover, the consumption would be huge.What was in even more serious condition were the disciples of the Diamond Sect. The anomalous substances in the bodies of these people were all very dense. At that moment, most of their bodies were greenish-black and they needed a large number of white pills or even clear dust pills to neutralize them.The Diamond Sect's sect master and a few protectors were all exhausted and aggrieved. In the distant horizon, a rainbow arrived.The Diamond Sect's ancestor had returned.He was also in a sorry state. There were many injuries on his body and his dishevelled hair suppressed his anger. After escaping from the forbidden zone, he had decided that he would do whatever it took to kill that kid.When he saw the mountain gate in the distance, he was stunned for a moment in mid-air. He instantly sped up and approached it. He lowered his head above the mountain gate and stared blankly at the ruins beneath his feet."Ancestor..." When the disciples of the Diamond Sect saw the figure of the ancestor, they immediately cried out."Ancestor, that kid took advantage of your absence and caused chaos in our sect. Our disciples suffered heavy casualties.""Old Ancestor, our treasure vault was also robbed clean by that bastard. Those he couldn't take away were tainted by the anomalous substances.""Ancestor, that kid is too inhumane. Many of our disciples are poisoned and it's hard to neutralize."Only the sect master, guardians and the others remained silent.Hearing the cries of the disciples, the Diamond Sect's ancestor looked at the broken mountain gate, at the miserable disciples and then at the sect master who had lost his arm and the injured guardians. His body slowly trembled.His face turned from green to white, then from white to red and finally to extreme green. His body staggered and he couldn't help but spit out a large mouthful of blood.As his breathing hastened, he clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were bloodshot as though he wanted to eat someone. He then let out a mournful roar toward the sky."I'm going to kill you!"This roar reverberated in all directions like thunder but it couldn't reach the location of Antler City's teleportation array. In Antler City, Xu Qing stood in line beside the teleportation array.In front of him was a huge teleportation array.This formation was constructed on top of a magic altar in the shape of an octagon. Countless runes were engraved on it and it was extremely complicated. Every time it shone, it would radiate boundless light with an imposing aura.There were also some guards with extraordinary cultivation bases in the surroundings who coldly looked at the people queuing up. Their gazes were ice-cold, as though they would be instantly killed if they had the slightest intention of going against the rules.Very soon, as the person in front disappeared, it was Xu Qing's turn. He then walked toward the altar where the teleportation array was located.When he stepped onto the altar and entered the complicated teleportation array, Xu Qing turned and looked at the world he had lived in for many years.At that moment, the sun was setting and the afterglow spilled onto the ground. The July wind brought along heat as it blew over, blowing the hair in front of Xu Qing's eyes, allowing him to see this world more clearly.He looked in the direction of the ruins of the city, then at the scavenger campsite. Finally, he coldly glanced at the Diamond Sect's location."We'll meet again."Xu Qing mumbled. His gaze grew colder and colder as the teleportation array beneath his feet shone brighter and brighter. This lasted until the sea of light erupted and drowned everything, including Xu Qing's figure.In the next instant, when the light from the teleportation array dissipated, Xu Qing, who was inside, disappeared.

Chapter ﻿75 Seven Blood Eyes (1)
August, summer.The scorching sun in the sky still wantonly integrated its body temperature into the wind, borrowing the flow of the wind to diffuse the heat on the ground. However, with the changes in the solar system, the heat inevitably came to an end.In the end, it could only stand in the sky and helplessly look at the ground, waiting for the swan goose to come, waiting for the black bird to return and waiting for the next white dew to appear.However, compared to the people on the ground, the location of the sun allowed it to see this island that was surrounded by the Endless Sea more clearly.The entire Nanhuang Continent was just an island.It looked like a slanted oval-shaped object and the interior was blocked by a vast mountain range that looked like a hidden dragon that traversed the north, south, and west.This mountain range was known as the Truth Mountain Range.The western part of the mountain range occupied 70% of the entire Nanhuang Continent. That was the largest forbidden zone in the Nanhuang Continent and it was known as the Phoenix Forbidden Zone.The interior was filled with a dark jungle and ancient ruins were buried everywhere. Fog lingered all year round and there were many mutated beasts. There were also countless bizarre creatures with extremely dense anomalous substances.As for the eastern part of the mountain range, it occupied 30% of the Nanhuang Continent. This was where the humans resided.Here, there was an extremely special location. It was located in the northern part of the Truth Mountain Range, the starting point that bordered the sea.This place was connected to the Phoenix Forbidden Zone in the west, the human race's territory in the east, the Endless Sea in the north, and the Truth Mountain Range in the south that extended to the other end.This landform made it the largest port on the entire Nanhuang Continent. There was an endless stream of gigantic cargo ships daily. Some came from the other islands in the surroundings and some came from... the Wanggu Continent.As such a special and important strategic location, it was naturally not something that ordinary forces could control. And this place was where the Seven Blood Eyes' mountain gate was located.From afar, the city where the port was located was divided into seven large regions. The port was only one of them. The city formed by these seven regions was shockingly vast and could be considered a majestic city.This was the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes.Beside it were the seven mountain peaks at the northern end of the Truth Mountain Range. Each mountain peak had a 1000-foot-long statue of a giant eye. The color was different but they all exuded sharpness. Regardless of day or night, the piercing light would never dissipate, forming a large array that enveloped the surroundings.These seven giant eyes looked down at the ground like the eyes of a giant beast. They were cold and sinister, causing everyone who saw them to be shocked.This was also the origin of the Seven Blood Eyes' name.The main city where the port was located, together with these seven mountain peaks, was the entirety of the Seven Blood Eyes Mountain Gate.Among them, the Seventh Peak, which was close to the main city, and the First Peak which was far away, were the tallest. It was like two giants were standing there, causing the thieves and scoundrels of the Nanhuang Continent and many other forces to feel trepidation.After all, in the Nanhuang Continent, even the 30% of the human race's territory contained great dangers.The wilderness was filled with anomalous substances and all kinds of mutated beasts and fugitives lurked there. Although mutated beasts weren't as ferocious as those in the forbidden zone, to the vast majority of humans, leaving the city and encountering them often meant a life-and-death crisis. This was especially so for those who were fleeing for their lives... In the wilderness where there wasn't much order, it was probably even more tragic than death.Therefore, for the vast majority of humans, living in a city was something they could only dream of.The main city of the Seven Blood Eyes was famous in the entire Nanhuang Continent. It wasn't only because of its prosperity but also because the Seven Blood Eyes' array formation could greatly isolate anomalous substances, allowing one's lifespan to greatly exceed the outside world.Hence, being able to enter the Seven Blood Eyes was the dream of too many people.Countless people yearned to come and countless people didn't want to leave after coming. It was as though they could pursue their dreams here. However... the rules of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city were extremely harsh.It was like an invisible whip that lashed onto the bodies of everyone who arrived.The name of this whip was... survival of the fittest.At that moment, in the main city of the Seven Blood Eyes Port, in the central area, three huge teleportation arrays were constantly shining.They were arranged in a triangular formation and there was an endless stream of people coming.In the third teleportation array, as the light flickered, the figure of a youth was revealed.The youth's upper body was covered in a dark-colored leather coat and he was wearing baggy pants. The ends of his pants were tied with grass ropes and they were covered in dried blood. His hair was very messy and his face was dirty.However, his eyes were abnormally bright like the stars. p1ease visi(t) n0ve1b(in).ne)t  As soon as he appeared, he heard bustling noises and the sound of waves. There was also a hot and humid wind that brushed past his entire body, making him feel sticky.All of this transformed into a strong sense of unfamiliarity that surfaced in the youth's body and mind.The youth was none other than Xu Qing, who had teleported over from Antler City."Have we arrived..."After Xu Qing teleported here, his head felt a little painful. At that moment, he rubbed the space between his brows and didn't stay on the array for too long. When he quickly walked out, he lifted his head and glanced at his surroundings.Everything here was orderly.A large number of black-armored guards patrolled and guarded the area. Outside each teleportation array, there was a team that looked like a long dragon. There were both men and women in the team and they were packed densely together. At the same time, there were carriages as well.They were all people who had teleported here. Every one of them had the desire to stay in this city visible on their faces. It was obvious that the teleportation fee wasn't low, so the desire in their expressions was even more intense.After scanning the surroundings, Xu Qing retracted his gaze and followed the crowd outside.The teleportation array here was different from Antler City. One had to go through an inspection before leaving. While Xu Qing was queuing for the inspection, he lifted his head and looked at his surroundings. From afar, he could see the pitch-black sea.

Chapter 76 Seven Blood Eyes (2)
On the other side of the mountain range, under the setting sun, seven mountain peaks were extremely conspicuous. This was especially so for the seven giant-eyed statues. The fluctuations they emitted seemed to be able to connect to the sky, causing the sky to form a huge vortex in the area of the seven mountain peaks.Within the vortex, there were clouds surrounding it and there seemed to be some gigantic ferocious beast within. As it moved about, it revealed a sense of divinity that intimidated all directions.This scene caused Xu Qing's heart to tremble.It was only after the person in front of him finished his inspection and left with the jade slip that was given out that Xu Qing took a deep breath and retracted his gaze."Show me your travel pass and answer why you're here." In front of Xu Qing, there was a table with two people sitting behind it, a man and a woman.The man was very handsome and wore a gray robe. At this moment, his eyes were closed as though he was resting but the spirit energy fluctuations from his body were very strong.The woman was also wearing a gray Daoist robe. She wasn't old and looked to be around 18 or 19 years old. Her small face was exquisite and her skin was fair.Her eyes were very spirited, like starlight. It was very easy for one to be immersed and unable to extricate themselves.The person who spoke to Xu Qing was that woman.She lifted her head and cast a glance at Xu Qing, not caring about the dirt on his body and face.She had seen too many scavengers like Xu Qing here. As she spoke, she casually took out a jade slip as though she was waiting for an answer and recording it.Xu Qing sensed the spirit energy fluctuations in the other party's body. The fluctuations weren't strong but for some reason, they gave him a very clear sense of danger.However, he weighed the pros and cons and felt that if it was a life-and-death battle, he had the confidence to kill the other party. Hence, he calmly took out the token from his leather pouch and handed it over."Hmm?" A hint of surprise appeared in the woman's eyes. She took the token and inspected it. When she returned it to Xu Qing, her expression was no longer cold. Instead, she cast a deep glance at him."So you're a junior brother who wants to join the sect. I wish you joy in the Seven Blood Eyes."The other party's words were a little strange. Xu Qing took the token and glanced at the jade slip in the other party's hand."You don't need an ordinary person's contribution jade slip here. Just take the token. This is your qualification. Also, let me remind you that you have to complete the entry test as soon as possible and adapt to the life of the Seven Blood Eyes as soon as possible!"After saying that, the woman ignored Xu Qing.Xu Qing was deep in thought. After he left the examination area, he noticed that the people in the queue behind him were looking at him with envy.This made Xu Qing lower his head and take a deep look at the token in his hand.After he left, the man beside the woman opened his eyes and smiled."Why are you suddenly so kind-hearted and even went to remind a newbie?""He has the token of my seventh peak. Although it's white, it's hard to say what will happen in the future. A word of blessing and reminder won't cost me any contribution points but once this person rises, it can be considered good karma."The woman calmly spoke and called the next person over for inspection."How can there be so many futures? One look and I can tell that this person is a scavenger. With the white token, I don't think he will have much luck. It's still unknown if he can pass the entrance test and obtain the status of a disciple. Even if he does, he will have to pay 30 spirit coins a day as well as expensive cultivation resources. I'm betting that he won't be able to hold on for two months. He will either be expelled or die with a bang."The man raised his hand and clenched it into a fist, then quickly stretched it out and gestured.Their voices were very soft, so Xu Qing, who had walked far away, didn't hear them.At this moment, he had already left the teleportation zone and entered the city.As he walked in, waves of emotions slowly stirred in Xu Qing's heart.What greeted his eyes was unprecedented prosperity and luxury.Under the afterglow, any building here was as gorgeous as the city lord's residence in his previous city.The green bricks and green plants that could be seen everywhere also made this place abnormally tidy.  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  There were even more people in the city. There was an endless stream of people and everyone's clothes were very clean. Most of them were made of silk and it was rare for them to wear hemp. However, their expressions were cold and they seemed to be in a hurry.At that moment, the sun was about to set and the lights of thousands of houses on both sides of the street could be seen. Under the illumination of the light, the brightness of the land didn't seem any different from during the day. Only the houses were very quiet and not a single sound could be heard.On a small river in the distance, there was a small boat. On it was a woman wearing a Daoist robe and a veil. She was currently throwing medicinal pills into the river, causing countless fish to circle around it. They would occasionally jump up, creating ripples in the afterglow.Many young men on the shore jumped into the river and fought with the fish for the medicinal pills. It was very strange.All of this caused Xu Qing to feel both unfamiliar and wary.He felt that this city was different from the scavenger campsite. It was also different from the small city where he had lived in the slums back then.However, there was also something similar.On the streets of this city, Xu Qing would always smell a hint of a familiar scent.This smell was very light. If it wasn't for Xu Qing being used to the slums and scavenger camps, it would be very difficult for him to smell it so keenly.It was the smell of blood, the same as in the slums and scavenger camps.A long time later, Xu Qing cast a deep glance at the city as the wariness in his heart deepened.As he pondered, he walked on the road. He didn't walk to the center of the road but to the darker edges. This was Xu Qing's habit.At that moment, he was preparing to find an inn to rest. The stench of blood here made him not wish to stay on the streets.As for the source of the blood, Xu Qing didn't wish to find out either. He knew that what he needed to do now was to complete the entry test as soon as possible and enter the Seven Blood Eyes to alleviate the Diamond Sect's pursuit.At that moment, in the dusk, the afterglow of the setting sun slowly dimmed. Xu Qing, who had yet to find a suitable place, looked at his surroundings as his gaze gradually turned sharp.As the sky gradually darkened, the entire city became increasingly quiet. The people on the streets also quickened their pace as the sky darkened.Among the thousands of households, although there were still lights, the gates of every household were closed and it was deathly silent inside.This was the case for the residences and shops. Only a few were still open but there were no customers inside.When the last rays of the setting sun disappeared in the distance, the entire street was empty.All of this caused Xu Qing to squint his eyes. He quickly walked a few steps in the dark and surveyed his surroundings, searching for an inn.Time flowed by and after the time it takes for an incense stick to burn out, Xu Qing finally saw an inn that was open from afar. He was about to head over when he suddenly looked into the distance.On the dark and empty street in the distance, a figure was fleeing rapidly. Seven to eight burly men were chasing after her with sinister smiles on their faces."You want to run? Let me see where you can run to!""It's been a long time since I've seen someone with such guts. To think that she actually dared to make a move on the contributor we have our eyes on!"Xu Qing's cold gaze swept over. The person fleeing in front was a woman. She seemed to be injured and her footsteps were a little unsteady. Under her dishevelled hair, one could barely see a fierce-looking face.p Xu Qing retracted his gaze. This matter had nothing to do with him, so he didn't bother with it and walked toward the inn that had opened for business.At the same time, the fleeing woman also saw Xu Qing. Her eyes flickered slightly as she suddenly spoke loudly."I've obtained the contribution points. Why are you still waiting here for help? Hurry up and escape."A cold light gathered in Xu Qing's eyes as he looked at the woman who had spoken such clumsy words.Being swept by Xu Qing's gaze, the woman couldn't help but shiver. She felt as though her entire body had been plunged into winter. Her eyes narrowed and her heart pounded violently. Cold sweat broke out on her back and the intense sense of danger even surpassed the pursuit of the people behind her.She knew that the situation was bad but she couldn't take back her words. She could only grit her teeth and flee in another direction.

Chapter 77 Are You Selling Corpses?
The sea breeze blew over, lifting Xu Qing's hair.He walked forward, allowing the wind to blow his hair and the hem of his pants. He was like a knife that was about to be unsheathed. His eyes gleamed coldly as he glanced at the woman who changed directions and left.Xu Qing hesitated for a moment. He didn't wish to kill on his first day here. Hence, he retracted his gaze and continued walking toward the inn.However, the wind didn't stop.At that moment, when the sea breeze reached the shore, the intent to attack became even stronger.Among the seven to eight burly men chasing after the woman, one of them had a scar on his face. He looked like the leader. When he saw this scene, he sneered."Regardless of whether it's true or false, capture this brat for me as well. With the fluctuations of the sixth or seventh level of Body Refinement, he must be someone with contribution points!"As they spoke, these seven to eight people immediately split into two groups. Four of them chased after the woman, while the remaining four headed straight for Xu Qing.Xu Qing frowned and swept his gaze over the four people who were approaching. These four people weren't ordinary either. They were all cultivators and most of them were at the sixth level of Qi Condensation. Moreover, it seemed like they mainly cultivated body refinement.However, he really didn't want to kill someone as soon as he arrived in this city. Hence, he stepped back to avoid them and spoke in a low voice."I don't know her.""Brat, I don't care if you know her or not. You're just unlucky!" The burly dude who pounced at him sneered. He waved his hand and punched out. The other three also attacked separately. One of them even had a saber in his hand as he laughed sinisterly.Under the moonlight, the blade gleamed coldly and was even smeared with poison.Xu Qing's eyelids drooped.Some people in this world liked to linger around the gates of hell. He originally didn't want to make a move but since the other party had killing intent, Xu Qing silently moved his body and no longer retreated.Instead, he moved like lightning and instantly appeared in front of the person who threw the punch. His left hand then landed on the forehead of the person.His speed was so fast that it was astonishing.With a bang, the burly dude's head exploded under Xu Qing's astonishing strength that was comparable to the great circle of perfection in body refinement. Amidst the bloody mess, Xu Qing's expression was calm. He took a step forward and arrived in front of the saber-wielding person. Under the person's horror, he used his shoulder to knock him.Half of the saber-wielding person's body suddenly collapsed.After that, Xu Qing threw two punches through the air at the two remaining people whose eyes were wide open and whose expressions changed drastically.Just as the two of them were about to retreat, a fluctuation appeared in the air in front of them, instantly enveloping them. In that instant, the two of them trembled intensely and blood spurted out. Their chests caved in, completely shattering as they breathed their last.Everything happened in the span of two breaths and all four of them died.This scene caused the four burly men who were sent out not far away to stop in their tracks. They stared at the expressionless Xu Qing with dumbfounded expressions and each of them felt as though their scalps were about to explode."Mis… misunderstanding… we…" That leader's earlier arrogance completely vanished. His body trembled and he was about to speak when he saw the coldness in Xu Qing's gaze. His mind then rumbled as he frantically retreated.The instant he retreated, Xu Qing moved.In the next instant, other than this leader, the other three people all trembled and spat out mouthfuls of blood. Bloody holes could be seen on their temples as they fell to the ground and died.Xu Qing's figure appeared beside them. He retracted his blood-stained finger and walked toward the fleeing leader.Xu Qing had a habit of not killing but once he acted, he wanted to eliminate all hidden danger.At that moment, Xu Qing moved closer to the other party. With an indifferent expression, he lifted his right hand and was about to descend."Fellow Daoist, I'm one of the Night King's men. Don't be rash…" The leader was shocked and hurriedly spoke with a look of despair.Xu Qing's right hand paused as he looked at the pale-faced burly dude who was trembling intensely. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Seven Blood Eyes disciple?""It's not the Seven Blood Eyes but…" The burly dude started and subconsciously answered. However, before he could finish his sentence, Xu Qing's right hand had already landed on the burly dude's forehead.With a bang, blood splattered everywhere.Xu Qing bent down and wiped his hands on the corpse. After that, he lifted his head and stared into the pitch-black distance. He pondered for a moment. He wasn't familiar with the terrain here, so he didn't search for the fleeing woman.However, he remembered the other party's appearance.After that, he lowered his head and was about to deal with the corpse when he suddenly had a thought. Xu Qing abruptly turned his head and looked at the inn in the distance, his body forming an attacking stance.At the entrance of the inn, an old man appeared out of nowhere. This old man wore a shopkeeper's robe and had a hunchback. His face was covered in age spots and his complexion was sallow. He looked sickly.After noticing Xu Qing's gaze, he grinned and revealed his yellowed teeth as he smiled."Kid, are you selling those corpses? How about eight corpses for ten spirit coins each?"Xu Qing started. This was the first time he had heard of someone wanting to buy a corpse. Hence, he cast a wary glance at the old man but didn't say anything. He lowered his head and began to deal with it.After being rejected, the old man shook his head helplessly."What a pity, what a pity. The corpses that just died are the freshest."A long time later, Xu Qing was done with his business. He then looked at the inn, hesitating in his heart as to whether he should stay there or not. As though he could see Xu Qing's hesitation, the old man outside the inn smiled and spoke."You look like you've just arrived here. In the vicinity, other than my shop, which is still open for business, the others are all closed. 80 spirit coins or 80 contribution points per night. I'm not lying.""Contribution points?" Xu Qing looked at the old man. Previously, he had heard the woman who framed him mention contribution points."As expected of a newcomer. You'll know the value of contribution points in the future. It's the same as spirit coins." The old man grinned.Xu Qing frowned. He felt that everything in this city was strange. The value of spirit coins and contribution points was the same. Someone wanted to buy a corpse and the property prices were so ridiculous."Don't think it's too expensive. The nights in the main city aren't too peaceful. The other inns aren't cheap either. I only have two rooms left." the old man said with a fake smile.Xu Qing pondered for a while. He looked at the sky and then at the old man. As he pondered, he narrowed his eyes and glanced at the street. At that moment, there was a blood shadow rapidly approaching. Its target was this inn.When he got close, he saw the figure of a cultivator. Without saying a word, he threw out a leather bag filled with spirit coins and disappeared into the inn."There's only one room left now." the old man said with a smile as he checked the leather bag in his hand.Xu Qing thought about it and decided to walk over. He handed over the spirit coins and booked the last room on the second floor. Before entering the room, he headed downstairs to the counter where the old man who was smoking a pipe asked."What's the point of buying those corpses?" The old man looked up and grinned."I have a little pet at home. They like it. What a pity, you still won't sell it to me. If you have such a thing in the future, remember to sell it to me. The price is negotiable."Xu Qing fell silent and glanced at the old man before entering the room.Here, he checked carefully. After confirming that there was nothing wrong, Xu Qing pushed open the window and looked outside.In the darkness of the night, the city was pitch-black. The vast moonlight cascaded down, as though draping a mysterious veil over the black city.The whistling of the ship's flute on the distant sea was transmitted by the waves. Under the beam of the lighthouse, one could faintly see huge boats slowly approaching.Looking at these, Xu Qing recalled the words of the female disciple beside the teleportation array. He then realized in his heart that this city was like a deep pool, hiding too many dangers. He finally knew where the faint smell of blood came from. After all, he had added a hint of blood to this city earlier.This place was very different from the environment he had lived in before in terms of architecture and cleanliness. However, at the core, there didn't seem to be any difference."In the end, it's still the Chaotic Era…" Xu Qing mumbled. He stopped thinking about these things and started to consider the entry test."Although there's a high chance that I'll be able to pass the test, I still have to be prepared. Once I fail, what should I do? Also, the Diamond Sect's ancestor is currently my greatest threat. I have to improve myself as soon as possible and then kill him."As these thoughts ran through his mind, the sky outside grew darker and darker. Although there were no roars or strange sounds from mutated beasts, as the wind blew in, the sounds of hooting and wanton laughter could be heard. It was the dark side of humanity.Xu Qing was used to this and didn't bother with it. He lowered his head and took out a sack.This item was something he had obtained from the Diamond Sect. He had also checked it on the way and was extremely shocked.This cloth bag looked very small, only the size of a palm. In reality, after opening it, it contained many things. There were so many items inside that it was the size of a bed.He had heard of such an item at the scavenger campsite. It was called a storage bag.A storage bag was an extremely rare item in the area Xu Qing had lived in previously. Its value was astonishing and it was very difficult to purchase.Just this storage bag was enough to make the Diamond Sect's heartache. Not to mention, there were many pill bottles inside that were filled with Clear Dust Pills.There were more than 30 of them.Compared to this, what made Xu Qing even more surprised was the 110 spirit stones inside!Xu Qing had never seen spirit stones before but Captain Lei had once imparted some knowledge to him during a meal and it included spirit stones.It was an item that was much more valuable than spirit coins. One piece was equivalent to 1,000 spirit coins and it was made from highly concentrated spirit energy. At critical moments, one could directly cultivate. Any piece of it was extremely valuable and Captain Lei had even described its appearance. That was why Xu Qing recognized it.These items were his greatest harvest from the Diamond Sect. As for the other miscellaneous items, they were nothing compared to his storage bag and spirit stones.Even though Xu Qing had checked many times on the way, he was still shocked by this windfall after he was done tidying up. This was the greatest fortune he had obtained since he was young."If I don't pass the test, then this sum of money should be enough for me to speed up my cultivation in this Seven Blood Eyes main city…" Xu Qing muttered and closed his eyes to begin cultivating.No matter where he was, no matter what the next test would be like, to Xu Qing, cultivation couldn't be stopped. This was the foundation of his existence in this world and it was also the best guarantee for his survival.After all, in this chaotic world, something that seemed eternal like the sunrise and sunset might change one day.Anything was possible.The only thing that didn't change was the survival of the fittest.Also… in Xu Qing's experience, places with many people were even more dangerous than forbidden zones. This was because it was the most difficult to judge the viciousness of the human heart.This was especially so for this Seven Blood Eyes main city that clearly hid dangers and mysteries.To the youth, this place was also a forbidden zone.Another type of forbidden zone.

Chapter 78 Divine Blood (1)
A night passed.Although the morning sun wasn't as strong as it was at noon, it still flowed domineeringly into the room through the window.It seemed that regardless of whether you were willing or not, as long as you didn't choose to hide under the eaves, it would land on the ground and land on you regardless of your objections.It wanted to use its warmth to awaken everyone who was sleeping.Xu Qing slowly opened his eyes.Looking at the light outside the window, his body seemed to have absorbed the summoning from the sunlight. As his blood and qi flowed, Xu Qing stood up.After stretching his body, he pushed open the door and cautiously surveyed his surroundings before disappearing into the distance.In the city, after daybreak, everything was different from the night.The breakfast shops opened one after another and it was the same for a large number of shops. The crowd slowly increased but it was still cold and hurried. It was as though everyone was surviving under immense pressure. However, occasionally, the sounds of children studying could be heard from the high walls. This seemed to represent that there was a certain level of order in this main city.Xu Qing, who was walking on the streets, thought of a medicinal herb called the Twin Flowers that Grandmaster Bai had introduced. It was a strange grass that coexisted with light and darkness. It was inseparable."Perhaps this is the norm in large cities?"Young people tend to accept new things faster than adults.This point was very well reflected by Xu Qing. It didn't take long for him to accept everything. After a simple breakfast, he also inquired about the time for the entry test.Regarding the entry test, the people in the city weren't unfamiliar with it. After learning that the daily test would be held at noon and at a certain location, Xu Qing spent the entire morning observing the Seven Blood Eyes' main city. This was his habit. n,o,v,e1,b,I,n[dot]n,e,t  After some observation, Xu Qing gained some understanding of the structure of the main city. It was just that the time was too short and the main city was too big. It was the size of tens of thousands of scavenger campsites. At the same time, there were many areas that only the Seven Blood Eyes disciples could enter.Hence, it was difficult for him to observe everything at once.However, he also found a path that led to the city gate. After confirming the buildings on the way, Xu Qing looked at the sky and walked toward the test location he had inquired about.The location of the Seven Blood Eyes' entry test was located at the southern edge of the city, at the foot of the Truth Mountain Range.Further south were the seven giant peaks of the Seven Blood Eyes. From afar, seven winding mountain paths extended to different peaks amidst the greenery. In this place, there was a huge public square. At this moment, the surroundings of the public square were covered by a light screen, blocking out the people from the outside world. Only those with tokens could enter.When Xu Qing arrived, there were already dozens of people waiting in the surroundings of the square. These people were all around the age of 17 or 18 years old. Some of their clothes were plain, some were luxurious, some were clean, and some were covered in filth like Xu Qing.They were all people who had come from various places to participate in the test.At the center of the square, three middle-aged cultivators were standing there. The spirit energy fluctuations from each of them had reached a terrifying level. They seemed to be slightly stronger than the Diamond Sect's ancestor.They chatted and laughed as they waited for the test to begin. However, their gazes would occasionally land on the surrounding disciples, as though they were weighing the pros and cons in their hearts.This scene made Xu Qing even more cautious.He wasn't good at socializing, so he quietly found a place. He wasn't too far away from the crowd, nor was he too close. As he stood there and waited, he also noticed that the people who were taking the test around him had a certain level of cultivation.This was especially so for a youth dressed in a long blue robe. He held a fan in his hand and while his clothes were luxurious, he was also very handsome. As he chatted and laughed, he attracted the attention of the other examinees in the surroundings."I'll share it with everyone.""The seven districts of the Seven Blood Eyes main city are divided into seven mountain peaks. These seven mountain peaks are all different in their expertise, so they each have their characteristics."For example, the Seventh Peak manages the port area. They have great authority and their cultivation arts are very special. Therefore, the combat strength of their disciples is astonishing. They travel far all year round and are accompanied by the Forbidden Sea."Another example is the First Peak. For example, the sharp swords of the sect are mostly used for training within the Phoenix Forbidden Land. Therefore, every single one of them is an incomparably cold-blooded battle cultivator. They rarely go out to sea and most of them use the forbidden zone as their tomb. They kill there and die there."These two peaks are the banners of the Seven Blood Eyes. Every year, too many people wanted to join them. However, these two peaks are very strict when it comes to accepting disciples. It's not that you chose them but that they chose you. Unless you have a specific token, you can't enter.""As for the other peaks, although they also require a token, it's a two-way choice. As long as one passes the test, one can register. Among them, the sixth summit has weapons refinement, the fifth summit has formations, the fourth summit has beast taming, the third summit has strange techniques, and the second summit specializes in alchemy."However, no matter which peak you join, before you reach the Foundation Establishment realm and have the right to gain benefits from the Seven Blood Eyes, your survival will be very cruel unless you are the owners of the core token. As for how cruel it is, you can experience it yourself after you pass the test."The youth smiled as he introduced to the people around him. At the same time, he was also observing them. As for Xu Qing, who wasn't far away, after he heard these words, he noticed the cruelty in the other party's words as well as the seven-blood eyes' right to profit. He could understand the literal meaning of the former but he didn't understand the latter. His heart was filled with doubts, but now wasn't the time to think about these things.Right now, he was mainly analyzing which peak was more suitable for him."I'm familiar with the forbidden zone." Xu Qing felt that the First Summit was suitable for him but he didn't know if his token was qualified.

Chapter 79 Divine Blood (2)
Just as he was pondering, the sound of a bell echoed from the seven distant mountain peaks.The three middle-aged cultivators in the square no longer laughed and chatted. Instead, they became solemn.One of them glanced at the dozens of testers outside and spoke calmly."Silence!"His voice wasn't loud but it sounded like thunder in everyone's ears.The blue-shirted youth immediately fell silent. The others also became nervous and looked at the middle-aged cultivator who spoke.Xu Qing's expression was calm as he lifted his head."The time for the test is now. There are a total of three tests. Those who pass all of them will be rewarded with 1,000 contribution points. If your overall ranking is first, the rewards are even greater. The first test is the mutation value in your bodies!""Now, everyone, step forward and hand over your tokens. Also, state your names. You can't hide it. Those who violate this will be severely punished!"As the middle-aged cultivator spoke, the blue-clothed youth rolled his eyes and was the first to walk onto the plaza. He handed over the token in his hand and spoke loudly."Disciple Zhou Qingpeng greets Senior."His voice was loud and clear and when it fell into the ears of the three middle-aged cultivators, they all nodded.After that, the second person stepped forward. Very soon, when there were only six people left, Xu Qing walked onto the plaza and respectfully handed over his token. He hesitated for a moment before speaking in a deep voice."Disciple Xu Qing greets Senior."After saying this, Xu Qing felt a little dazed. It had been a very, very long time since he had told others his name. To be precise, it had been almost seven years.After saying that, Xu Qing lowered his head and silently retreated. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ The three middle-aged men glanced at the token he handed over and didn't pay much attention to him.Just like that, when all the testers had completed this segment, the first test officially began.The first test was simple. As the middle-aged cultivator waved his hand, a ten-foot-tall green-colored mountain rock appeared out of thin air with a boom. It landed on the square and stirred up a cloud of dust."Follow the sequence just now and come up one by one. Just press your hand on them."Zhou Qingpeng immediately went up.Xu Qing paid attention and saw that after the other party's hand pressed down on the stone, the green-colored stone instantly shone with light. A picture of a human body then appeared on its surface.More than 40 dots lit up in the pattern."42 points, not bad. Passed." The middle-aged cultivator at the side nodded and called for the next person.Zhou Qingpeng's expression was a little smug as he took a few steps back and observed the others closely.p Very soon, as everyone continued testing, Xu Qing also saw some clues.The higher the number of points, the greater the mutation value in one's body. Among them, many exceeded 100 points and were evaluated as unqualified."I should be someone who doesn't have…" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. He didn't wish to expose himself on the first day he was here without understanding the situation. This wasn't in line with his personality.However, being too mediocre might affect the sect's choice. Hence, Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at his shadow. He then slowly controlled it slightly, allowing it to fuse into his body.As he continued to extract anomalous substances, cries of surprise rang out from all directions. "34 points, excellent!" The middle-aged cultivator's voice fluctuated slightly. Xu Qing immediately lifted his head and saw a girl who was about the same age as him standing beside the limestone.The girl's clothes were similar to his and her face was dirty. She was also a scavenger.She seemed to be very nervous and lowered her head, not daring to look at anyone. After bowing to the middle-aged cultivator, she quickly walked to the side."I think her name is Li Zimei." Xu Qing recalled the other party's name and retracted his gaze before walking forward. When he reached the bluestone, he calmly lifted his hand and pressed it down.As the light shone, dozens of light spots slowly emerged from the human-shaped pattern. They seemed a little unstable and were still flickering."43 points. Not bad, passed." The middle-aged cultivator swept his gaze over and nodded.Xu Qing hurriedly retracted his right hand and walked to the side. The anomalous substances in his body that he had suppressed earlier and prevented from being absorbed by the shadow quickly fused into the shadow and disappeared.43 points. This result couldn't be considered outstanding but it wasn't bad either. Xu Qing felt that it was enough.In reality, this was indeed the case. Out of the 60-odd participants, only 19 had a score below 50 and 20 had a score above 100.At that moment, these twenty people all had pale expressions."According to the comprehensive results of the three tests, the second test will test your will. Now, all of you, step forward and sit cross-legged." The one who spoke was another of the three middle-aged men. This man had a horse-like face and a solemn expression. His voice was hoarse.As his voice rang out, everyone stepped forward and sat cross-legged. After Xu Qing sat down in the crowd, he lifted his head and looked at the long-faced middle-aged man. He wanted to know how his will was measured.The moment he looked over, the long-faced middle-aged man waved his hand and took out a small metal bottle. This bottle was silver in color and had a large number of runes carved on it. It looked very ancient and contained an extremely unique charm.After he took it out, his and the other two people's expressions became much more solemn."There's a drop of blood that has been diluted countless times. Once it's stimulated, it will form a deterrence. If you can't withstand it, you can bite the tip of your tongue and give up."With that, he opened the bottle and poured the contents onto the bluestone.Xu Qing stared at it. Very soon, he saw a drop of golden liquid falling from the metal bottle. This liquid was very viscous and seemed to have formed its own body.The moment it landed on the huge green rock, the green rock immediately shone brightly. As the golden light spread in all directions, a roar that seemed to come from ancient times erupted from the place where the golden blood fell.As it erupted forth, it was as though a gigantic eye had manifested within.The vertical pupil of this eye had countless tentacles growing out of it, swaying as though they wanted to crawl out. It was extremely strange but at the same time, it also contained a hint of holiness.It was like a lofty god that looked down on all living beings, looking at everyone with incomparable coldness.All the examinees who were sitting cross-legged here felt a boom in their minds, as though heavenly lightning had exploded in their heads.All of their bodies trembled intensely, as though all the flesh and blood in their bodies had lost control and were about to separate from their bodies. At the same time that the feeling of being torn apart surfaced, their expressions changed rapidly.A tremor that originated from the depths of their souls, as well as an intense sense of crisis that originated from their instincts, erupted crazily in their hearts. This caused these testers to instantly lose their intelligence. Three of them even directly coughed out fresh blood and fell to the ground wailing.Even Zhou Qingpeng and Li Zimei's faces instantly turned pale. Their bodies trembled intensely and blood flowed from their noses. Their eyes were bloodshot.Only Xu Qing's body was trembling at this moment. However, the shock in his heart was even more intense.Because… he was familiar with these eyes!It was exactly the same as what he saw when the god opened his eyes and looked at the sky. It couldn't be said that it was exactly the same but the feeling of deterrence was…The same!

Chapter 80 The Seventh Peak
However, what was different was that the broken face of the god in the sky opened its eyes and its pupils turned into the shape of a cross.This illusory eye only had a vertical pupil.As for its might, it was like the difference between the blazing sun and a firefly. The former could instantly mutate an area into a forbidden zone, while the latter could only form a deterrence that could shake one's mind.Of course, this should have something to do with the illusory eye being formed by a drop of blood that had been diluted countless times. If it was pure blood, its might would be even more terrifying.However, no matter what, even if the real eye appeared, compared to the fragmented face of the god, there was still a world of difference.Even so, the shock Xu Qing felt was still incomparably intense. His body was only one aspect but what caused waves in his heart was that this matter had broken his understanding."Could it be that the Seven Blood Eyes can already extract the flesh and blood of gods?""This is impossible… The two give me the same feeling but it's clearly not the same. In that case, there's a high chance that there are existences similar to gods in this world?"This guess caused Xu Qing's breathing to become even more hurried. He stared at the illusory eye on the limestone and a strong desire to learn more about this world arose in his heart.At the same time, as the pressure rumbled, the people on the plaza spat out mouthfuls of blood one after another. Half of them couldn't hold on and were sent out by the long-faced cultivator with a wave of his hand.Very soon, only three people persisted.Zhou Qingpeng wasn't among them. Among the three of them, there was Li Zimei and an ordinary-looking youth. Although the youth's clothes weren't like scavengers', they were plain and simple. He came from a small city.At that moment, his persistence had reached its limit. Very soon, blood gushed out and he had no choice but to give up. After that, it was Li Xiaomei's turn.As for the last of the three, it was naturally Xu Qing.Willpower could be faked.However, this time around, Xu Qing didn't wish to lie in front of such a god-like cold existence.He instinctively didn't want to submit to the other party.Hence, he stared at the illusory eye and his entire body tensed up. His heart pounded with unprecedented intensity as he cooperated with his will to fight against the illusory eye."Under the gaze of the god's fragmented face, I struggled to survive. At this moment, the pressure formed by this drop of blood that has been diluted countless times cannot make me submit!"Xu Qing's eyes slowly turned bloodshot and his body trembled. At that moment, it was as though all the flesh and blood in his body were screaming. However, under the suppression of the powerful will he had tempered in the slums and the forbidden zone's jungle, he was firmly in control.At that moment, he was the only one still resisting in the entire plaza. This scene caused the hearts of all the examinees in the surroundings to tremble violently and they all looked at Xu Qing in shock.Even the long-faced middle-aged man and the other two cultivators turned their gazes to Xu Qing with astonished expressions.This was because Xu Qing had persisted for a very long time.This year's test had been carried out for a month. So far, there were only three people who had persisted for so long like Xu Qing."I wonder if this kid can survive the last wave of attacks.""No one has succeeded in this test this year."As the three middle-aged cultivators transmitted their voices to each other, more than half of the golden liquid on the bluestone had dissipated. However… at the instant when it was about to completely dissipate, the illusory eye on top of the bluestone suddenly moved. Its gaze then shifted from scattered to locked onto Xu Qing.An even more terrifying pressure gathered on Xu Qing's body at this instant. It was as though the gods wanted to make all things submit, suppressing them with an earth-shattering rumble.Xu Qing's entire body trembled intensely and his head slowly lowered as though it was being pressed down by a mountain.This scene caused the expressions of the three cultivators to turn serious as they observed carefully.However, in the process of lowering his head, Xu Qing's body trembled even more intensely. In the end, he slowly lifted his head again. The veins on his forehead bulged, and his blood-colored eyes revealed a wolf-like coldness that contained unyieldingness.The instant he looked at the illusory eye, the seventh level of the Mountains and Seas Art, Body Refinement, erupted from his body at this moment. It rapidly transformed behind him and quickly formed a pitch-black shadow.This figure was tens of feet tall and its entire body was pitch-black. It had two spiral horns on its head and a pair of purple eyes. Its bloody mouth suddenly opened and let out a soundless roar toward the illusory eye.ROAR!!!Xu Qing also let out a low roar and made contact with the illusory eye on the limestone.At the next moment, his entire body trembled as though a heavy hammer had smashed into his mind. As blood spurted out, the shadow behind him dissipated. However, the illusory eye on the limestone also turned blurry at this instant and finally dissipated. Best n0vel online free at n0νEℓnEXт  It was over.Xu Qing's breathing was hurried and he forcefully endured the headache. After a long time, he struggled to stand up and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He then cupped his fists toward the three middle-aged cultivators who were standing there with deep gazes. After that, he turned and silently walked down the plaza.In the surroundings of the plaza, everyone who couldn't hold on earlier all looked at Xu Qing as though they were looking at a monster. Their faces were filled with disbelief and horror."Qi and blood… Blood and Qi Shadow Formation? This only appears when one's body is at the great circle of perfection in Body Refinement. It's comparable to the great circle of Qi Condensation!" An uncertain voice echoed out.At the next moment, gasps rang out one after another.Only Xu Qing stood there silently with his eyes closed. He could sense that the pain in his mind was slowly dissipating at this moment. There seemed to be an even stronger perception growing.It was like forging. After repeated tempering, one's edge would be revealed.In reality, the second test was also like this, containing good fortune. However, those who could obtain it were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.This caused Xu Qing to be stunned. After a careful examination, he discovered that his perception seemed to be much sharper than before. It was as though his will had become more tenacious. He had no way to prove the latter but his senses couldn't be wrong."Very good!"On the square, the three middle-aged cultivators who were in charge of the test revealed looks of admiration as they looked at Xu Qing. The long-faced cultivator even nodded at him."Your name is Xu Qing, right? The ultimate suppressor who can survive the second test will have a great increase in his mental strength. By using the blood of a divine creature as a whetstone, the tempered will will be incomparably tenacious!" "A divine creature?" Xu Qing looked at the long-faced cultivator.The other party didn't explain. He retracted his gaze and stopped talking. At that moment, the third test began.The person presiding over the third test was one of the three. This person had a round face and small eyes but the sharpness in his gaze was very sharp. After he walked out, he swept his gaze across everyone and spoke calmly."The third test is actual combat. Fight against mutated beasts in an illusion array."After saying this, the round-faced middle-aged man pointed at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, you don't have to participate. Your body refinement has reached the level where your qi and blood can turn into shadows. You already possess the combat strength of the great circle of perfection. There's no difference if you participate in the third round of the test or not. I'll allow you to pass the first round."As soon as he spoke, the other examinees in the surroundings were filled with envy but they could say nothing. Just now, the shadow behind Xu Qing had completely intimidated them."Thank you, Senior." Xu Qing lowered his head when he heard this. He then cupped his fists and bowed deeply.He wasn't good with words but he knew that he had to be polite when facing good intentions.Very soon, the third test began. As he watched the others entering the square one after another, Xu Qing decided to sit down cross-legged and recuperate his spirit. By the time the third test ended, his spirit had mostly recovered.Through this recovery, Xu Qing deeply understood that his perception seemed to have doubled compared to before.Specifically, it showed that he could instantly sense the movement of the wind and grass within a certain range. This scene caused his heart to race and his eyes to shine."To think that there's such feedback from tempering my will… I have to test out my control over the shadow when I get back. It should be more agile now."While Xu Qing was in deep thought, the third test ended very quickly.Everyone returned to their original positions and nervously waited for the results. Xu Qing also stood up and looked at the three middle-aged cultivators who were communicating with each other."It's a pity that the first peak requires a specific token…" Xu Qing lowered his head and looked at the token in his hand. He didn't know which peak he would be arranged to enter next.Not long later, the announcement for the start of the competition was made. Among the 60-odd people, half of them were eliminated.Those who were eliminated all had pale expressions. Those who didn't pass the entry test were told that they had to leave the Seven Blood Eyes within two hours. After that, they would be killed by the array formation.The word "kill" caused Xu Qing's eyes to narrow. It also caused those eliminated to have extremely bitter expressions.However, leaving wasn't the only option.They were told that if they had enough spirit stones to purchase contribution points, they could also stay in the main city. However, the cost would be the same as the commoners, 30 spirit coins or 30 contribution points a day.As for the disciples who passed the test, although they would also consume 30 contribution points a day, they would gain an additional right to purchase the cultivation resources of the Seven Blood Eyes.Xu Qing was a little ignorant about this and didn't understand it very well. However, he believed that he would be able to clarify everything very soon.Not long later, the remaining people who passed the assessment were told one after another that they belonged to the mountain peak."Zhen Han, First Peak.""Zhao Chungang, Third Peak.""Zhou Qingpeng, Seventh peak."…Among them, five people went to the first peak, three to the seventh peak, and six to seven people to the remaining five peaks.As the long-faced cultivator's voice rose and fell, Xu Qing waited silently. He didn't hear his name.Not long later, Xu Qing lifted his head and his gaze froze."Xu Qing, Seventh Peak."After the long-faced cultivator called out Xu Qing's name, he swept his gaze across the youths in front of him and calmly spoke."All of you who passed the test will be rewarded with 1,000 contribution points each. The person ranked first is Xu Qing. He will be rewarded with 10,000 contribution points."When Xu Qing heard this, he heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that the Seventh Peak was also very good. At the same time, he was also shocked by the amount of reward money.He secretly did some calculations. The contribution points and spirit coins were equal in value. 10,000 contribution points equaled 10,000 spirit coins. If he counted them as spirit stones, it would be 10 spirit stones."So many!" Xu Qing was a little surprised.At this moment, after the long-faced cultivator finished speaking, he took out the jade slip and operated it. Very soon, Xu Qing felt his token trembling. When he lowered his head to take a look, the pattern on the front of the token automatically distorted and transformed into an ancient text that represented 10,000 words.But very soon, the number changed to 9999, a little less.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed.The other disciples who passed the test also sensed the changes in their tokens one after another. All of them had rueful expressions on their faces. As the long-faced cultivator summoned them, they were taken away in batches.The round-faced cultivator beside him walked toward Xu Qing. After he got close, he glanced at Xu Qing's token and smiled."Stop looking. I'll introduce them to you later."With that, he summoned the other disciples who had joined the Seventh Peak and called out to Xu Qing as they walked toward the mountain path that led to the Seventh Peak."Let's go. I'll bring you guys to the Seventh Peak's mountain gate. You guys have to cherish it because this might be your only time going up the mountain!"
