Two diamond-shaped bones and a feather.There was a red glow on each of them, as though they belonged to the same source. They gave off extraordinary auras, but it was a pity that it had nothing to do with sturdiness. It was more about the augmentation of spells and speed."I wonder how many spirit stones I can sell them for.""There's also my white pills. I've accumulated another thousand…" Xu Qing counted his assets and walked out of the magic boat to the breakfast stall he visited every day.The boss of the restaurant was a middle-aged man with no cultivation. He was an ordinary resident of the main city and looked honest. When he saw Xu Qing, he grinned.He had a very deep impression of this handsome youth from the Homicide Department. The other party didn't have the viciousness of a Seven Blood Eyes disciple and was very polite. Xu Qing did not even need to order, the boss soon served a few buns and steamed eggs, as well as a plate of side dishes.Xu Qing thanked him and sat there, picking up his chopsticks and eating slowly. Right now, he was already used to using chopsticks. After he finished eating, he placed a spirit coin on the table before getting up and walking to the Homicide Department.Reporting for duty was very easy in the Homicide Department. One only needed to touch the bluestone in the courtyard of the Black Division with their identity token.Xu Qing, who was familiar with all of this, finished checking in and used the excuse of being on duty to walk on the streets under the morning sun.On the way, he encountered some disciples from the Homicide Department. Most of them greeted him politely. After the battle with Night Dove, Xu Qing had gained some amount of fame in the Homicide Department. Best novel online free at​ ɳσʋҽʅႦιɳ Xu Qing bought a few pears on the streets. He walked toward the medicinal shop while eating the pears. He planned to sell the white pills first and then sell the materials given by Huang Yan yesterday before he went to see how much more he needed to exchange for the giant whale skullThe medicinal shop was soon within Xu Qing's sight. It was still the shop where he bought herbs and alchemy pills. It was very lively with people coming and going.Xu Qing could be considered a regular here. His appearance was immediately noticed by the busy shopkeeper. The shopkeeper's eyes lit up and he walked out of the counter with a smile."I haven't seen you in a while. Are you here to buy herbs or to sell pills?""Selling pills."The shopkeeper's enthusiasm grew even more. As for the medicinal pills that Xu Qing took out, he merely swept his gaze over them and happily handed over 20 spirit stones."Aren't you going to take a look?" Xu Qing looked at the shopkeeper."There is no need to check your pills." The shopkeeper smiled and waved his hand.Xu Qing nodded. He was confident that the quality of each of his pills was top-grade. He cupped his fists and walked out of the shop.Seeing that Xu Qing had left, the shopkeeper hurriedly took out a jade slip. After sending a voice transmission to his boss, he called over a staff member and placed Xu Qing's pills in a box, asking the staff member to send them to the Second Peak immediately.This shop assistant was very quick-witted. He knew that the boss seemed to value these pills very much. After leaving the shop, he quickly ran and took a shortcut to the Second Peak. Not long later, the box was sent to a cave abode on the Second Peak and placed in front of a young girl.The young girl looked to be around 16 or 17 years old. She wore a light orange Daoist robe and sat there with no makeup on. She took out a pill from the box and held it before her eyes to observe.Under the sunlight, her skin was as fair as snow, and her eyes were like a pool of clear water. Her jet-black hair was tied up in a princess bun, and there was a beaded hairpin with tassels hanging from it.This young girl was none other than the owner of the medicinal shop. She was also the person Xu Qing had met at the entrance of the medicinal shop before.As she observed the pill, she let out a soft cry of surprise. Her brows were slightly raised, and her eyes revealed surprise."The purity has actually increased?"p She had previously studied Xu Qing's alchemy pills and discovered that although she could also achieve the same purity, she couldn't do it every time. Hence, she couldn't help but feel a little competitive."Since a disciple of the Seventh Peak can do it, as an alchemy cultivator, there's no reason for me to be unable to!"The young girl waved her jade-like hand, and stalks of medicinal herbs flew over from all directions. With a serious expression, she began refining.While she was about to compete with Xu Qing in alchemy, Xu Qing was currently walking on the streets and looking at the weapon refinement workshops of the Sixth Peak's disciples in the surroundings. His brows furrowed imperceptibly and a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.He didn't know if it was an illusion, but when he passed by these shops today, a few of the Sixth Peak's shopkeepers seemed to be intentionally or unintentionally glancing at him, as though they were confirming something.It wasn't like this in the past."Are they observing me?" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes. This abnormal scene made him even more vigilant, so he simply gave up on staying around.He didn't enter any of the shops to sell his ingredients. Instead, he returned to his berth at Port 79 and began his cultivation with great vigilance.Several days passed, but nothing major happened. Xu Qing was hesitant, but he was still cautious. Every day, he would pass by the shops of the Sixth Peak while on duty and secretly check them out.That kind of observation never appeared again, but Xu Qing was still worried. He decided to wait for a few more days. After confirming that everything was normal, he found a shop that hadn't observed him from the start and prepared to head over.If he wanted to upgrade his magic boat, he would ultimately have to go to the Sixth Peak's shops to trade for materials. Almost all of the Sixth Peak's shops that were related to magic boats were located in the port area. It was like a monopoly. The Sixth Peak shops in the other areas did not do business of magic boat materials.Hence, even though there was a trace of uncertainty, Xu Qing was still prepared to give it a try.Xu Qing warily walked on the streets with quick steps. However, just when he was about to reach the shop he chose, a familiar voice suddenly rang out from behind him.

Chapter 122 The Weird Ancestor (3)
"Xu Qing."Xu Qing turned his head and saw the figure of the little fatty, Huang Yan, not far behind him.Huang Yan had seen Xu Qing from afar, and was waving his hands enthusiastically while running forward. As he ran, the flesh on his body trembled. When he got close, he spoke proudly. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Xu Qing, do you know that my senior sister sent me a message again? Haha, let's go. I'm in a good mood today. I'll treat you to the egg."After he finished speaking, he wanted to pull Xu Qing away. However, Xu Qing stepped back and avoided him. But when he thought about the strange egg and the fact that the other party had given him materials, he hesitated for a moment."I want to sell materials.""Selling materials? What do you lack? I can give them to you," Huang Yan said generously.Xu Qing shook his head."Alright, then I'll accompany you to sell the ingredients, then you'll accompany me to drink the eggs. It's settled then." Huang Yan had a happy expression on his face. It was obvious that he was anxious to share his joy with others. After he finished speaking, he looked around and pointed to the shop at the side."Let's go to this place. I've been to this place a few times. It's not bad."Xu Qing looked at the shop that Huang Yan was referring to. This shop was also the destination of his trip. There were many disciples buying and selling here. Xu Qing's gaze swept over and saw a familiar face. It was none other than Zhang San.He was also purchasing materials. When he noticed Xu Qing outside, he smiled and greeted him."Let's go, let's hurry up and sell them all. Drinking eggs is the most important thing." Huang Yan spoke.Xu Qing's gaze swept across the shopkeeper in the shop. He no longer hesitated and entered.This shop was very large and had a total of two floors. There were all sorts of mutated beast materials hanging inside, and each of them was extremely valuable. As they got closer, the shopkeeper at the counter raised his head.This shopkeeper had a mustache and looked very shrewd. He looked at Xu Qing and smiled."Two fellow disciples, what would you like to buy?" "Selling materials."Xu Qing calmly spoke and walked to the counter. Under the gaze of the shopkeeper, he took out the materials from the leather pouch. Not only were there items given by Huang Yan, but there were also some loot from killing wanted criminals.The shopkeeper looked at Xu Qing and then swept his gaze across the materials placed on the counter. After pondering for a while, he picked up a few items. He took a closer look for a while before casting a meaningful glance at Xu Qing.His expression gradually turned gloomy, and the light in his eyes sharpened."Little friend, there's something wrong with these items of yours.""A few days ago, the Diamond Sect reported to my Sixth Peak that their sect had a theft and lost a lot of resources. These items of yours… are all recorded in the records. They are items that the Diamond Sect lost. Little friend, what is the meaning of taking out the stolen goods and selling them to us?""Could it be that the Diamond Sect's theft is related to you?""As a disciple of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes, could it be that you stole from the Diamond Sect?"The shopkeeper was clearly doing this on purpose. His voice grew louder and louder, spreading through the entire shop. In an instant, all the disciples from the various peaks in the shop fell silent and looked over in unison.Xu Qing wasn't surprised, but he sighed softly in his heart. He felt that he was already cautious enough, but he still couldn't avoid it. However, he also knew that it had something to do with the Diamond Sect's ancestor. Killing intent instantly surfaced in his mind, and the sense of danger was intense. He could tell that the person who helped the Diamond Sect's ancestor was definitely a major character from the Sixth Peak.He swept his gaze across the shopkeeper's neck and the various materials placed on the surrounding shelves. He then looked in the direction of the sea, and a cold glint appeared in his eyes. Inwardly, he was considering whether he should make a big move and leave or fight for what was right. However, just when Xu Qing was weighing the pros and cons in his heart, the eyes of the little fatty, Huang Yan, immediately widened. His body then leaped up and fiercely slammed the counter, creating a loud bang."Stolen goods? Is this also a stolen good?"The little fatty picked up the mutated beast bone that he had given to Xu Qing. His eyes were filled with unprecedented anger, as though he had suffered a great humiliation."This is my f*cking item. You dare to say that my item is stolen goods?"The little fatty furiously threw the bone in his hand at the shopkeeper's face.

Chapter 123 The Terrifying Huang Yan (1)
Huang Yan's voice was extremely loud, and his eyes revealed intense anger. It was as though the shopkeeper wasn't humiliating Xu Qing but him.After all, among the items on the counter, there were three that he had given to Xu Qing.Faced with Huang Yan's anger, the shopkeeper's expression turned increasingly gloomy. He grabbed the bone the other party threw at him.Holding the bone, he coldly glanced at Huang Yan.He thought to himself, 'You didn't leave the Pilotage Department for the past eight years just to chase after a senior sister who might be a village girl from the countryside. You gave her so many gifts that everyone knows about it, becoming a joke. Since you're looking for trouble now, don't blame me.'p He spoke slowly, "You're right. This is stolen goods. It seems that you are also an accomplice in the Diamond Sect's theft case. Men, go and report this to the Homicide Department. The criminals in the Diamond Sect's theft case have walked right into the trap."The shop assistant pretended to take out a voice transmission jade slip. He looked at the shopkeeper and understood what he should do. He started to slowly send a message and report the case.The eyes of the disciples from the various peaks in the shop gleamed as they watched this scene.To be able to enter the Seven Blood Eyes and survive in such an environment, most of the disciples had highly active minds. They naturally saw through such a simple trick. They also understood that the main point of this matter wasn't the Diamond Sect's theft, but that someone from the Sixth Peak wanted to find trouble with Xu Qing and Huang Yan.As for whether it was both of them or just one of them, it was hard for them to tell. However, they felt that there was a high chance that it was targeted at Xu Qing who took out the items.No one spoke. They just watched from the side. Zhang San was the same.Xu Qing didn't care about the gazes of the others. Right now, he was very surprised by Huang Yan's reaction. Although the relationship between the two of them wasn't bad, it wasn't deep after all. The other party's reaction somewhat puzzled him.At the same time, Xu Qing was even more puzzled that the shopkeeper wanted to report the matter to the Homicide Department and the pretentiousness of the staff at the side. It seemed that this trap wasn't like what he had thought earlier, where they wanted him dead.This was because if they really wanted to kill him, they could have just attacked him. There was no need to involve the Homicide Department and complicate things. The important figures would not cause a scene to kill piedmont disciples. This was unreasonable.This matter seemed more like they wanted to make use of this opportunity to beat him up and give the Diamond Sect an explanation.Moreover, before he entered the shop, he had also sensed that there weren't any overly powerful fluctuations in the surroundings. Even now, it was still the same. It didn't seem like there were any experts present.Just when Xu Qing was deep in thought, Huang Yan glared angrily when he heard the shopkeeper reporting to the Homicide Department."The Homicide Department? Xu Qing is one of them!""Oh? Since you know the law and broke it, the severity of your crime will be increased by one level!" The shopkeeper looked at Huang Yan and frowned as he slowly spoke. Huang Yan was so angry that he started laughing. Xu Qing was feeling increasingly puzzled about this matter. He lifted his hand and stopped him from rushing as he spoke softly."Huang Yan, this matter has nothing to do with you. You can leave first."After that, he looked at the shopkeeper's neck with a calm expression and slowly spoke."These are the spoils of war I obtained from wanted criminals. You don't have to slander me. If you have anything to say, just say it."The shopkeeper immediately became vigilant. Xu Qing's reaction made him realize that this person was indeed not simple. In fact, after the higher-ups made the arrangements for this matter, they could have directly gone to Xu Qing and asked him to hand the items over. However, the disciples who knew about this, including him, wanted to take this opportunity to make a fortune. Hence, they resorted to slander.But now, the other party had clearly seen through his tricks. In reality, he also had some understanding of Xu Qing. He knew that someone who could rise to prominence in the Homicide Department was naturally not a simple person.As a shopkeeper, he had someone protecting him from the back, so he wasn't among those who had to kill and loot each other to survive. Generally speaking, no piedmont disciple would dare to touch someone like him.However, the feeling of chill on his neck still made him decide to change his mind at this moment. He didn't want to have too many conflicts with Xu Qing. In addition, he felt that he had already used the stick enough and it was time to show the carrot. He was just about to speak up to ease the tension and state the conditions for resolving this matter.But at this moment, Huang Yan, who was stopped by Xu Qing, let out a furious roar."Xu Qing, you don't have to help me shoulder this matter. This matter has nothing to do with you. This is clearly targeted at me, Huang Yan. I know, it must be Zhao Zhongheng. He holds a grudge against me and knows that I come here often, so he colluded with this shop to slander me!"As soon as Huang Yan's words came out, the shopkeeper's expression instantly turned strange. He cast a deep glance at Huang Yan as though he was looking at a weirdo. Xu Qing also looked at Huang Yan with narrowed eyes. He wanted to solve the problem, but Huang Yan seemed to want to shift the blame to himself.Huang Yan slammed the counter loudly. Just when he was about to continue bellowing, footsteps rang out from outside the shop, and a cold voice rang out."Who dares to cause a scene?" A few figures stepped into the shop.Xu Qing turned his head and narrowed his eyes.These figures wore gray-colored Daoist robes with the emblem of the Homicide Department on it. They were members of the Homicide Department, and the person in the lead was the captain of the Earth Division's Team Three, the merfolk youth whom Xu Qing had followed for more than half a month.Behind him were four members of Team Three. As they entered, the merfolk youth cast an indifferent glance at Xu Qing. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "So it's you."Xu Qing didn't say anything, but the vigilance in his heart had risen to the extreme. The person who responded to the case so quickly was the merfolk youth who had a deep conflict with him. Something did not smell right.

Chapter 124 The Terrifying Huang Yan (2)
Xu Qing felt that today's event was extremely complicated. There were three reasons buried within. The first one was that the shopkeeper wanted to teach him a lesson, but it was clearly just a lesson that could be resolved.The second was that Huang Yan seemed to have intentionally dragged the matter onto himself. His motive was unknown.For the third reason, the merfolk youth's arrival could hardly be considered a coincidence.Before he understood the entire situation, Xu Qing didn't wish to act rashly.The merfolk youth who entered the shop swept his gaze across the others in the shop with a hint of disdain in his eyes.In reality, joining the Seven Blood Eyes wasn't his original intention. Although the merfolk race wasn't large, his status in the race was extremely high which had caused him to develop an arrogant personality. This was especially so when he faced the human race. He looked down on them from the bottom of his heart.As for today's matter, after the department received the report, the Black Division should have been the one in charge. However, because it involved a member of the Black Division, the case was handed to the Earth Division to avoid the whole Black Division from being suspected. After the merfolk youth found out that the case was about Xu Qing, he recalled the fight for credit and disgust he felt back then, so he personally accepted the task and led the team over.He pointed at Xu Qing and Huang Yan."Since they are the main culprits in the Diamond Sect's theft case and have all the stolen goods, and one of them is a member of my Homicide Department, let's bring them to the division for interrogation."When Huang Yan, who was at the side, saw that the people of the Homicide Department still couldn't distinguish right from wrong, his anger completely erupted. He ran between Xu Qing and the merfolk youth and glared at the merfolk youth as he let out a low bellow."Are you blind? Are my things stolen goods?"As he spoke, he took out his storage bag and shook it in front of everyone. Immediately, one material after another poured out, piling up into a small mountain of several hundred items.Most of the various mutated beasts' materials in the pile came from the same source as the bones and feathers. Clearly, they were obtained from a mutated beast.When the surrounding people saw this, they all sucked in a breath of air and their eyes widened. They were all people who knew their stuff and knew that the value of these materials was probably several thousand spirit stones. This was especially so when they noticed that Huang Yan actually had a storage bag. As such, all of their eyes revealed a strange glint."You guys said that my things are stolen goods. Are these all stolen goods? Can the Diamond Sect afford them? This is an entire f*cking windrun beast. I gave its most precious part, the skull, to my senior sister, but you guys actually said that my things are stolen goods!!"As soon as the little fatty spoke, the gazes of everyone in the surroundings flickered. Xu Qing also looked at those items and instinctively took a deep breath.He knew that Huang Yan was rich, but he was still shocked by the materials in his storage bag.The merfolk youth glanced at the shopkeeper.The shopkeeper felt a headache coming on. He didn't expect the Homicide Department to be so fast and disrupt his rhythm. At this moment, he had a look of hesitation on his face, but since the arrow was already on the bowstring, he had no choice but to shoot. He braced himself and spoke."The Diamond Sect's report mentioned this wind beast!"Seeing that the situation was developing in an unbelievable direction, Xu Qing fell silent and calmly observed."The skull is also stolen goods. Did you give it to your Senior Sister? So there's a female criminal who helped to fence the stolen goods. Why aren't you guys capturing them? Take them back and interrogate them carefully. Capture that female criminal as well and bring her to justice."The merfolk youth calmly spoke. The four team members behind him immediately walked toward Xu Qing and Huang Yan. One of them moved closer to Huang Yan while the other three headed straight for Xu Qing."You're the criminal, your entire family are criminals!" Huang Yan jumped up, rolled up his sleeves, and rushed over angrily.Xu Qing stared coldly at the three people walking over. He originally didn't want to act rashly before he understood the entire situation. But now that the other party was being overbearing… He lifted his right hand and waved it.Immediately, the droplets of water in the surroundings erupted with intense pressure. They formed a suppressive force, causing the expressions of the members of the three approaching people to change drastically. Shock appeared in their eyes, and their bodies trembled violently, unable to take a single step forward.Although they had worked with Team Six to capture Night Dove members back then, they hadn't seen Xu Qing make a move with their own eyes. They had only heard a little about it from others. Now that they had personally experienced it, their hearts were in turmoil."Resisting law enforcement." The merfolk youth smiled, revealing a mouth full of sharp teeth. He then took a step forward, and his speed directly caused a sonic boom in the shop. In an instant, he appeared in front of Xu Qing and lifted his right hand to grab Xu Qing's neck.His fingernails were sharp and emitted a cold light. If it was someone else, it would be very difficult for them to react at this speed. However, the instant he got close, a black iron stick appeared in front of his palm.Although his speed was fast, Xu Qing was even faster. As he waved the iron stick in his hand, he bent his right knee and ruthlessly kicked at the merfolk youth. Amidst the rumbling, the mermaid youth's right hand quickly retracted, and his right foot bent, using his knee to strike Xu Qing's knee.Xu Qing's body swayed slightly. As for the merfolk youth, he retreated five steps. When he lifted his head, his eyes revealed a bloodthirsty excitement."Interesting." A rumbling sound came from his body, and the fluctuations of the ninth level of Qi Condensation spread out. Behind him, a malevolent-looking merfolk phantom holding a black fork appeared.This wasn't the transformation of qi and blood into shadows, but the innate power of his bloodline. At this moment, as he erupted forth with power, his body charged out once more, instantly approaching Xu Qing. He then directly clashed with Xu Qing in the shop.The two of them exchanged blows seven or eight times in an instant. Every time, there would be a loud bang and the impact echoed, causing the shop to be affected. Fortunately, there was an array formation here, so it didn't collapse.However, this scene still caused the expressions of the people who were dodging left and right to reveal intense light."They're so strong!""As a member of the merfolk race, the leader of Team Three possesses the innate bloodline power of the merfolk race. From the looks of it, his combat strength is comparable to a disciple at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm of a large sect. As for this Xu Qing… he's also so astonishing!""Previously, there were rumors that an ordinary member of the Black Division killed an enemy leader of the Night Dove. I think it must be Xu Qing!",m Hearing everyone's words, Huang Yan, who was dodging at the side, blinked. There was a hint of a smile that didn't look like a smile on his face, but it quickly dissipated and turned into a furious appearance as he roared."Xu Qing, you can do it! Kill this fish! He dares to frame us, kill him! We'll eat fish meat tonight!"At this moment, the merfolk youth retreated once again. There was a smear of blood at the corner of his mouth, and the bloodthirsty glint in his eyes grew even more intense. Fresh blood made him even more excited. Moreover, he still had trump cards that he hadn't used yet. He grinned and raised his hands to perform a series of hand seals.However, he didn't notice Xu Qing's shadow under his feet.Xu Qing's expression had been calm from the start. At this moment, he narrowed his eyes and killing intent flashed in them. Just when he was about to attack, a few powerful auras suddenly spread out and locked onto this place."You guys just watch." As the merfolk youth laughed sinisterly, the auras quieted down. However, an even more terrifying aura appeared outside the shop.With a boom, it directly suppressed the few auras that had locked onto this place earlier.This scene caused the merfolk youth to be stunned. When he turned his head to take a look, his expression instantly changed drastically. Xu Qing also lifted his head. When he sensed the aura outside, his eyes abruptly narrowed.The figure appeared in everyone's sight and a cold female voice rang out from outside the shop."Just now, who said that my things were stolen goods?"Her voice was like a cold wind, instantly freezing everyone in the shop. Regardless of whether it was the merfolk youth or the shopkeeper of the Sixth Peak, all of them couldn't help but tremble when they heard this sentence. They couldn't help but look at the person walking over.It was a woman. Her body was tall and muscular with bronze-colored skin that exuded a sense of toughness. Her long hair fluttered in the wind, but there was no grace to it. Instead, there was a hint of wildness.She wore a dark purple Daoist robe and was dragging a huge black sword that was five feet long. As she walked over, the tip of the sword drew sparks on the ground, cutting open the floor tiles and the threshold.This scene caused everyone to gasp. It was unknown who was the first to bend over. At the next moment, everyone lowered their heads and cupped their fists respectfully."Greetings, Second Highness!" p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  "Greetings, Second Highness!""Greetings, Second Highness!"The person who came was someone who was like the eldest princess of the Seventh Peak. She had the right to decide the life and death of the piedmont disciples. She even had the right to remove the title of core disciple. She was the second personal disciple of the Peak Lord!"Senior Sister, you're finally here." Huang Yan excitedly crawled out from his hiding spot and ran over.

Chapter 125 The Domineering Second Highness (1)
Among the three personal disciples of the Seventh Peak's Peak lord, if you were to talk about the disciple with a forthright personality, tactful, and had a wide range of friends, it would be the third disciple.However, if you were to talk about who among them had a fiery temper and was feared by their fellow disciples, Second Senior Sister would take the lead without a doubt. Not only did the disciples of the Seventh Peak feel this way, but the other peaks also felt the same.Most of them knew that the second highness of the Seventh Peak had an explosive temper and had an even more exaggerated strength. If there was the slightest disagreement, she would make a move. Moreover, the number of Foundation Building cultivators from the various peaks she had beaten up over the years was too many.With her astonishing strength and a heaven-defying background, there was no reasoning with her. Her domineeringness was as famous as her reputation in the entire Seven Blood Eyes.Usually, even some elders would have a headache when they faced her, let alone ordinary disciples.This was especially so for her reputation. Not only did it spread in the sect, but it was also illustrious at sea. Countless pirates had died in her hands, and some small clans would tremble when they heard her name.At this moment, she stood there with a terrifying aura that suppressed the surroundings, causing everyone to feel immense pressure. Xu Qing was the same. An intense sense of danger rose in his heart, as though he was facing a peerless ferocious beast in the forbidden zone's jungle.The feeling was even stronger than when he saw Deacon Li.The old ancestor of the Diamond Sect was much weaker in comparison.Xu Qing's vigilance reached its peak. He instinctively took a few steps back, and his breathing grew hurried.The vicious intent coming from Second Senior Sister was too intense and terrifying.In fact, from the gap beside him, he could see that the streets outside were empty... It was as though no one was willing to appear in the vicinity at this moment.Only the little fatty, Huang Yan, didn't feel any pressure. He even looked excited as though his scheme had succeeded.He arrived beside Second Senior Sister and spoke with an aggrieved expression."Senior Sister~ It's the shopkeeper of this shop and that stinky fish. They said that the things I gave you were stolen from the Diamond Sect. Senior Sister, I, Huang Yan, am an upright and honest person. I'm incomparably sincere, honest, loyal, gentle, and considerate. I only love you, Senior Sister. It's fine if they slander me, but they can't slander the gifts I gave you!""Slandering my gifts to Senior Sister. This is slandering my eight years of feelings for Senior Sister!" The little fatty stood beside Second Senior Sister, looking a little out of place. Regardless of height or thickness, he was like a child standing beside an adult.Fortunately, his stomach was very big. To a certain extent, they didn't seem completely incompatible.However, his words caused everyone in the shop to be stunned for a moment. They all took a deep breath and their expressions were filled with incomparable shock.These disciples of the various peaks who had been watching the commotion earlier now widened their eyes in disbelief. There were even some who found it unbelievable. Zhang San was the same.As for the shopkeeper, his expression was completely dull as he muttered."Second Highness... is your senior sister?"These words were said awkwardly, but it revealed the inner world of the shopkeeper, where countless emotions were surging.Everyone here knew of Huang Yan. After all, he was considered quite famous in the Seventh Peak. However, most of his fame came from his 'infatuation'.Everyone had more or less discussed Huang Yan in private. They knew that he had pursued a certain senior sister for eight years, and the gifts he gave her could buy several shops...When they talked about this in the past, most of them could guess that this Huang Yan wasn't ordinary. That was why he was able to keep his wealth and not die until now. However, most of their discussions about him contained a hint of mockery. They thought how could a man bend his back and curry favor with a woman to such a degree?However, at this moment, regardless of whether it was Zhang San, the shopkeeper, or the other disciples here, all of them looked at the little fatty with unprecedented admiration in their gazes amidst their astonishment. Some even revealed intense envy in their eyes.Clearly, if the senior sister was such a person, then they wanted to give her gifts too.Let alone eight years, they could continue giving gifts for even 18 or 28 years.Xu Qing's heart also pounded wildly. He looked at the little fatty and then at the second highness. His gaze was a little dazed. He really didn't expect that the person the little fatty had been pursuing for eight years was actually the second highness of the Seventh Peak.,m And now, he also had an answer to the reason why the little fatty had forcibly taken the blame for this matter. The fatty had intentionally blown things up to attract his senior sister over to relieve the pain of lovesickness.Xu Qing looked at the incomparably complacent little fatty and then at the domineering and terrifying second highness. He fell silent.In the face of Huang Yan's grievance, the second highness raised her brows slightly and walked forward. When she passed by the merfolk youth who had his head lowered, she didn't say anything but her eyes clearly revealed some disdain.Huang Yan, who was at the side, also showed disdain. He lifted his chin and snorted.The gaze from the second highness greatly stimulated the merfolk youth. His body trembled as though he was trying his best to control it. However, the paleness on his face still revealed the terror in his heart.His mind instinctively recalled the massacre on Merfolk Island thirty years ago. That figure that was filled with bloodlust during that massacre.That was a competition of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes. Due to the evilness of the human race and the unyielding nature of the great merfolk race, the Seventh Peak's competition was arranged in the merfolk race's territory.At the same time, this was also a suppression. It was also after that incident that the two sides became 'allies' once again.Although Seven Blood Eyes was the one who managed to resolve the crisis of the merfolk's extermination in time and provided them with many resources, in the eyes of all the merfolk, this was what they should do. They felt that becoming allies with the human race was a humiliation in itself.Countless emotions surged in his heart, but he still lowered his head deeply and didn't dare to lift it up. He only roared inwardly. He swore that the merfolk race would make the Seven Blood Eyes pay the price sooner or later.Seeing that the other party kept on bowing, the disdain in the second highness' eyes deepened. She walked up to Xu Qing and stared at him coldly.Xu Qing took a deep breath. His expression was solemn as he cupped his fists and bowed. "Greetings, Second Highness.""Senior Sister, this is Xu Qing, my brother. He was also implicated by me this time around." Huang Yan put away the items he had taken out earlier. When he introduced them, there was a hint of pride in his expression.The second highness nodded and ignored Xu Qing. She then walked toward the counter. When she got there, she swung the large sword in her hand. The shopkeeper trembled as the sword landed heavily on the counter.This large black sword was too heavy. Even though the wooden counter was quite sturdy, it still caved in with a cracking sound when the large sword landed. This caused the tip of the sword to directly press against the shopkeeper's stomach. The cold chill it emitted caused sweat to stream down the shopkeeper's forehead. His face was extremely pale as he spoke in a trembling voice."Second Highness, I...""Are you saying that my items are stolen goods?" The second highness calmly asked.More sweat covered the shopkeeper's body, and his back was drenched. His face was filled with bitterness, and he wailed in his heart. He originally wanted to make a fortune from today's matter, but the little fatty appeared out of nowhere. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that the little fatty had such a great god backing him.He couldn't afford to offend this person in front of him. In fact, he felt that even the deacon who arranged for him to do this wouldn't be willing to easily offend this second highness who was like a living dinosaur.After all, this was the Seventh Peak's eldest princess, who was doted on by Old Master Seventh. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He stammered and hurriedly spoke."Mis-misunderstanding. This is a misunderstanding. I saw it wrongly. How could they be stolen goods..."When Xu Qing saw this scene, a deep glint appeared in his eyes. He understood strength was the eternal and unchanging principle of this world. This was especially so after he heard the second highness' following words, which allowed him to understand what was called domineering."You didn't see wrongly. These are indeed stolen goods. I was the one who robbed the Diamond Sect. Do you have any objections?" Second Senior Sister coldly spoke. The sword in her hand pushed forward and instantly pierced the shopkeeper's clothes, touching his stomach.The shopkeeper's body trembled, and more sweat seeped out of his forehead. He could only continue to agree and didn't know how to respond."Tell the person behind you that I was the one who robbed the Diamond Sect. Also, tell the Diamond Sect to come and apologize to me in three days. They have to give me a gift that satisfies me."There was clearly no threat in Second Senior Sister's words, but after everyone heard it, they deeply understood that if the Diamond Sect didn't come to apologize or if the value of the gift wasn't enough, then... the Diamond Sect would cease to exist in this world.This sentence fully displayed the second highness' domineeringness. She then swept her gaze across the items scattered on the ground."Are you going to take these?""I-I'll take them..." The shopkeeper spoke up immediately. He didn't dare to breathe loudly as he hurriedly took out 100 spirit stones. But when he saw that Second Senior Sister's brows were raised, he trembled and took out another 100 spirit stones while gritting his teeth.He placed the 200 spirit stones at the side and squeezed out a smile at Huang Yan and Xu Qing, his gaze filled with pleading.Second Senior Sister did not continue to frighten the shopkeeper. She picked up the large sword that was smashed on the counter and walked out. When she passed by the merfolk youth, she spoke with disgust."Scram, you're in my way. Stinky fish."The merfolk youth's body trembled even more, but in the end, he still silently took a few steps back."Goodbye, Second Highness!"As the second highness walked to the entrance, everyone in the shop cupped their fists and spoke with great respect.Xu Qing lifted his head and stared deeply at Second Senior Sister's back. He then cupped his fists as well.Right now, Huang Yan's expression was filled with pride. He swept his gaze across the silent crowd and patted Xu Qing's shoulder."See, this is my senior sister, my goddess. Let's see who dares to slander us in the future.""However, you're really something, kid. You didn't hesitate to help me because of my matter, and you even wanted to help me shoulder the burden. I'll remember this matter. Let me tell you, I'm someone who repays kindness with kindness. Right now, I don't have anything good on me. When I see something good later, I'll give it to you as a gift."Huang Yan's expression was extremely smug. After he finished speaking, he waved his hand at Xu Qing. Without waiting for Xu Qing to speak, he ran out in a hurry and chased after the second highness."Senior Sister, wait for me..."Xu Qing's expression was still in a daze. After a while, he retracted his gaze from the door and casually glanced at the corner of his shirt. He then glanced at the gloomy-looking merfolk youth. A hint of eerie intent flashed in his eyes, but it quickly returned to normal.He took the 200 spirit stones that the shopkeeper had given. Under the other party's bitter and fearful gaze, he walked out of the shop and didn't even glance at the merfolk youth.When he walked out of the shop, Xu Qing tidied his clothes and swept his gaze across the corner of his shirt. His gaze then turned gloomy.At the same time, the merfolk youth in the shop looked at Xu Qing's departing back with an ugly expression. His mood today was extremely bad, and there was a hint of disgust in his eyes."Those who fought with me, even if they managed to escape, very few would be able to survive. It's a pity that I can't see the scene of their deaths."Snorting coldly in his heart, the youth retracted his gaze. He flicked his sleeves and walked out of the shop.To him, Xu Qing was just an ant. If it wasn't for Huang Yan, he would have definitely killed Xu Qing today."Everyone from the Seven Blood Eyes deserves death. This kid stole my credit, so he deserves death even more. He'll die sooner or later."

Chapter 126 Road To The Underworld
The sunlight was scorching in the noon. Before the sun reached the god's fragmented face, it emitted a piercing light, making it difficult for mortals to raise their heads and look straight at it.The god behind the sun was high and mighty. To all living beings, He was an existence that surpassed time and space. Regardless of day or night, regardless of reality or dreams, regardless of the past or future, He would always be eternal.Witnessing the changes in this world, witnessing life and death, and also witnessing this chaotic world that had become cruel because of His appearance.As for the remaining heat in the sunlight, it seemed to be affected by the ferociousness of the god's fragmented face and became filled with malice. It was as though it was unwilling to comply with the Heavenly Dao in this season and leave silently.It started to crazily release all its heat and invaded every corner of the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, wanting to vaporize all life.This invisible poison invaded even the shade of the trees and under the eaves. Even when the sea breeze blew over, it couldn't disperse it. It was like poison that seeped into the marrow and bones.Just like the corner of Xu Qing's Daoist robe.That place looked normal, but if one took a closer look, they would see that there was some powder on it, and most of the powder had disappeared by now .The aura it emitted was similar to the heat that was affected by the god's fragmented face. It carried malice and malevolence as it invaded Xu Qing's flesh and bones under his Daoist robe.The speed of this invasion was extremely fast and revealed avarice.From its appearance to its invasion, it only took a few breaths of time.Xu Qing calmly glanced at the corner of the clothes. His eyes narrowed as he walked toward the berth.The powder on the corner of his shirt was something that the merfolk youth had secretly left behind during the fight earlier. If it was someone else, it would probably be very difficult for them to detect it even now.After all, this poison was colorless and odorless. To a certain extent, this might not even be poison.However, Xu Qing was proficient in the Dao of Medicine. This characteristic caused at least seven to eight similar medicinal primers to appear in his mind. As for which one it was, he needed to go back and analyze it.However, no matter what, after coming into contact with him several times, Xu Qing's killing intent toward this merfolk youth rose even more."It's time to kill the fish."Xu Qing mumbled as he walked to the harbor's berth. The instant he stepped onto the magic boat, he immediately activated his protective barrier, isolating all sounds from the outside world and causing the inside of the magic boat to be completely silent.He sat cross-legged in the cabin and directly tore off the corner of his Daoist robe.He held it in his hand and took a closer look. His left hand then formed a seal, and a ball of flames instantly floated up from Xu Qing's palm.Although the Sea Transformation Art focused on water, it was normal for spell cultivators to cultivate many types of spells as support.There were many introductions on the cultivation art jade slip.Xu Qing waved his left hand, and the fireball flew toward the corner of his shirt, enveloping it and starting to burn it.The sizzling sounds continued, and faint smoke drifted out.The flickering light from the fire illuminated Xu Qing's face.He watched as the burning corner of his shirt continued to twist, and the red lines from the burning edges rapidly filled the entire cloth. Wherever they passed, the gray corner of his shirt would turn into ashes.A few breaths later, the corner of his shirt was completely burned, and the flames slowly extinguished.Xu Qing looked at the ashes in his palm and smelled the smoke coming from them as he mumbled."This is the blood of Ghost Desire. It's poison, but not poison."The pharmacopeia Grandmaster Bai had left behind mentioned Ghost Desire. These creatures that lived in the deep sea were very rare. Xu Qing also had two of them, but he didn't find any supplementary herbs, so he didn't touch them.He knew that after its blood was treated, it would become a holy medicine that could heal injuries. However, if he used other methods to mix it, under the two extremes of yin and yang, the aura emitted by its blood would be loathed by the vast majority of mutated beasts."There are also the characteristics of the Enlightenment Grass." Xu Qing closed his eyes. After coming to a conclusion, he opened his eyes again. His gaze was like a pitch-black deep pool, incomparably cold.Although Grandmaster Bai's pharmacopeia didn't mention what would happen after the two types of medicinal ingredients were mixed together, according to medicinal knowledge, the latter could greatly magnify this disgust.A slight disgust would make the mutated beasts avoid the source, but if it was serious, it would be equivalent to attracting the killing intent of the mutated beasts. Because extreme dislike was evil.Hence, after these two were mixed, they would form a special medicinal liquid.Those who came into contact with it would be tainted and invaded by its aura.This was because it wasn't poison and wouldn't act up. In fact, it even had a slight nourishing effect on the body, so it was almost impossible for it to be detected. It was even more difficult to dispel it, and it could last for at least several years.As for its effect, it was to attract intense disgust of mutated beasts. Like when Xu Qing first participated in the Thunder Team's operation in the forbidden zone in the scavenger campsite, the small vial of medicinal catalyst in Barbaric Ghost's leather pouch was this type of medicine.Barbaric Ghost's medicinal catalyst was the same as the aura that invaded Xu Qing. However, the ingredients couldn't be compared. The difference between the two was like heaven and earth."While I'm in the sect, I won't be in too much danger from this aura. But if I go out to sea..." Xu Qing was very clear that once he brought this aura out to sea, he would definitely not be able to return.This method of killing left no corpse or bones at all. It was sinister like a venomous snake and was effective for an extremely long time. If it wasn't for Xu Qing's Dao of Medicine, it would be very difficult for others to guess who the enemy was even after death."I wonder if you have the ability to sense my poison." A cold glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. The merfolk youth had poisoned him, but in reality, just like the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind, when Xu Qing attacked earlier, he had also poisoned the other party!This poison was also harmless and also a mark.However, the merfolk youth's mark on him attracted the evil intent of unknown mutated beasts in the sea, while his mark on the other party was the footsteps of the Grim Reaper on the shore.Xu Qing's expression didn't change at all. He kept the burning ashes and opened his storage bag. He glanced at the medicinal pills inside before looking at the surrounding medicine cabinets. p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He wasn't good at detoxifying poison, especially with this kind of aura that wasn't really poison, so the recovery ability the purple crystal provided wouldn't be of any effect.But he was good at poison.Xu Qing calmly took out some poison powder and poison pills and swallowed them expressionlessly. He then mixed seven to eight types of poison powder and scattered them. He then inhaled deeply and absorbed them all into his body.At the next moment, his body trembled violently, and sweat slowly appeared on his forehead. However, he still sat there cross-legged, silently enduring the pain of the poison burning in his body. He was brewing the killing intent in his heart, while his mind was as calm as the calm before the storm.His poison burned his internal organs, bones, and flesh.Since he couldn't get rid of the aura of the Ghost Desire and the Enlightenment Grass, he might as well use poison to invade them. After that, he would use his own recovery abilities to recover.This process lasted for a full four hours.When it was dusk outside, Xu Qing slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot, and the poison in his body had been completely expelled due to the astonishing recovery rate of his body. At the same time, the aura of Ghost Desire was also expelled.After carefully checking and confirming, Xu Qing looked at the setting sun outside the cabin. His gaze was deep as he mumbled."Very soon, I'll be able to have a good sleep."He silently stood up and washed his body before closing his eyes to rest.A while later, the sun in the sky seemed to have given way to the moon. The sky started getting dark. The sparse stars in the sky were like fireflies in the cemetery. They were insignificant and only served as embellishment.This night was suitable for killing.Xu Qing opened his eyes and quietly placed the black iron stick in his sleeve. He then sharpened the dagger and stuffed it into his shoe.After that, he checked his poison inventory and calmly arranged them. Only then did he walk out of the magic boat. His speed erupted and disappeared in an instant.The moonlight scattered on the ground, giving off a cold feeling. It shone on the cats that were moving forward in dark areas. It also shone on the figure of the youth who was like the wind and his lone wolf-like eyes, making his gaze look even colder.The sea breeze blew over, bringing with it a chill. It landed beside the youth and lifted his long robe, causing his black hair to flutter. However, it couldn't disperse the unique aura that permeated the main city that came from his mark.In the end, it turned into a whistling sound in the youth's ears, like a horn of killing intent.He was going to kill.

Chapter 127 Kill The Fish! (1)
The night wind was like a blood-stained sickle, bringing with it a fishy smell and moisture. The messenger of death carried it as it wandered to every corner of the city.In the darkness, the messenger of death advanced without restraint. Under the horn of killing intent, it seemed to fuse with all the shadows in the city, continuously gathering and dispersing. It was enough to make all lives despair.Until… in the midst of this pervasion, it encountered a person in a dark and distant corner.It was a figure dressed in a gray robe. In the dark night, his back view seemed as though it couldn't be cut by a blade or pierced by a needle. The chill he emitted seemed to block the starlight from the sky.It was suffocating.At this moment, it was as though the flowing river met the sea, as though the greedy jackals had met the wolf king.Its footsteps stopped, and its invisible pervading body fell silent. In the silence, it seemed to be observing until the gray figure slowly turned its head. His cold eyes revealed a calmness that was like a dark pool.It laughed.It was as though it had found its faith, as though it had found its kindred spirit. It carried the scythe of death and cheered around the gray figure, lifting his long hair and swaying his robe."The wind tonight is a little strong," Xu Qing muttered softly. He then turned his head and continued to stare at a house in the darkness.The house in his eyes was like a coffin, emitting a deep and heavy sensation. That was the residence of the merfolk youth he had found during his investigation.The other party was different from the Seventh Peak's disciples. He didn't seem to have the qualifications to own a magic boat. Hence, he could only choose to stay on the shore with his entourage.Xu Qing calmly stared at the house. He wasn't in a hurry. In this dark night, his even and light breathing was like ice water meandering, long and deep.He was waiting.The aura of the mark accurately told Xu Qing that the person he was waiting for was here.Also, judging from the pattern of the fish going out alone last time, this fish should head out in the next few days. And today, the fish was in a very bad mood.Xu Qing felt that there was a high chance he would get the opportunity tonight.Time flowed by. Two hours later, when the moon was once again covered by the dark clouds, a gust of night wind blew over. From the house that was already buried in the darkness, the sound of wind gusting could be heard.This sound caused this coffin-like house to feel even more desolate. It was like a low, hoarse moan before death, echoing in the quiet night sky.A figure appeared on the tall wall of the house.His gray Daoist robe couldn't hide the fishy smell that emanated from his body. His green gem-like eyes also didn't seem to be able to change his sinister nature.His loose robe that moved with the wind was like a silhouette, giving off a false sense of grandeur. However, it was only a thin layer, and it looked more like human skin that had been peeled off.  p1ease visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  He was none other than the merfolk youth.His mood was extremely bad. What happened during the day made him feel that he had suffered a great humiliation."So what if you're the Seventh Peak's Eldest Princess? Sooner or later, I'll cripple you and use your body to feed the spirits and maggots!" The merfolk youth gritted his teeth. Due to his bad mood, he chose to head out now which was a few days early. He felt that he had to vent his anger.As for the way to vent his anger, he had already gotten his two elder sisters to make arrangements. His enjoyment was not girls but children.This was a hobby he couldn't let too many people know about. He got joy from torturing children from other races.His body swayed and he moved into the night.As he moved forward, his figure slowly blurred and eventually disappeared. Regardless of sight or perception, others would lose track of him. It was as though he no longer existed.However, the scent of the mark wouldn't disappear.Xu Qing lifted his head and watched as the other party's figure disappeared. His expression was calm as he silently walked into the night.The wind grew even stronger, like the clash between blades and air, echoing endlessly in this quiet night.An hour later, in a corner of an alley, the void distorted and the merfolk youth's figure reappeared. The instant his figure appeared, he sensed danger and retreated abruptly.However, it was still too late. A thick water curtain instantly formed behind him and even in the surroundings, directly enveloping the entire alley. The instant the alley was completely sealed off, a low roar rang out from the water curtain.A gigantic whale formed from a spell protruded from the water curtain and rapidly took shape.It exuded coldness and killing intent. It opened its mouth wide at the merfolk youth, revealing its sharp teeth. With an incomparably ferocious aura, it pounced over.The merfolk youth's gaze was sharp."Interesting. Since I'm in a bad mood today, I'll play with you."As he spoke, he raised his hands and was about to perform hand seals. However, at this moment, the shadows that had fused with the darkness instantly dispersed into numerous strands like ropes. They rapidly arrived from all directions and coiled around the arm of the merfolk youth, preventing him from completing his hand seals. At the same time as his palm was enveloped by the shadow ropes, the shadows also rapidly spread toward his neck.Regardless of whether it was his hands or the skin that was touched by the shadows, they all emitted a piercing pain as though they were rapidly corroding. This scene was too sudden, and the expression of the merfolk youth changed drastically for the first time.The intense life-and-death crisis and the intense piercing pain caused his breathing to become hurried. As he struggled, the whale formed by the water screen in front of him had already arrived in front of him. It directly swallowed him.However, the instant the whale swallowed, the merfolk youth let out a roar and a blue light erupted from his body. The beam of light was like a sharp thorn, attempting to chase away the shadows on his body while shooting out in all directions.

Chapter 128 Kill The Fish! (2)
The light beam directly collided with the incoming whale. The whale collapsed loudly, but it didn't scatter. Its remaining strength was still like waves crashing down with a boom.The merfolk youth's body trembled and he retreated, spurting out fresh blood. Taking advantage of the time when the blue light slowed down the strange shadow, he revealed a savage expression and was about to open his storage bag.However, at this moment, the shadow that pervaded his body erupted forth once again, wrapping around his hands once more. After stopping his movements, it continued to rapidly spread throughout his body.This scene completely shocked the merfolk youth. Right then, a black-colored cold light whistled over from the darkness and headed straight for his forehead.Behind this cold light, he saw a figure, a gray figure charging from the water screen ahead!The figure was as fast as a bolt of dark lightning.The figure was a young man. His black hair fluttered in the wind and he had no expression on his face. Only the light in his eyes revealed incomparable coldness amidst the calmness.Around him, the wind swirled as though it had turned into a sickle and there was an emissary of death beside him. With a sinister smile, the emissary lifted its black cloak and followed the young man."It's you!!" The merfolk youth recognized Xu Qing. In this life-and-death crisis, he suddenly spat out a stream of silver light.This silver light grew and instantly transformed into a huge flying wheel that whistled toward the black iron stick. The loud sound of weapons colliding rang out.Because the force contained was too great, both the flying wheel and the black iron stick were deflected during the collision. The collision and the deflection of the weapons couldn't stop the exchange of gazes between the merfolk youth and Xu Qing.The instant their gazes met, Xu Qing directly approached. At the same time, the cheeks of the merfolk youth swelled up abruptly, transforming into sharp thorns that seemed to grow on his face. This made him look sinister. He then quickly spat out a blue pearl."Die!" The merfolk youth let out a low roar. The blue pearl instantly erupted with an even more astonishing beam of light, directly enveloping the nearby Xu Qing.He was very confident that under his innate divine ability, unless one was a Foundation Building cultivator, even if they were at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm, very few people would be able to survive. The corners of his mouth curled into a sinister smile and he was about to continue suppressing the strange shadow on his body.However, at the next moment, his expression changed drastically following the rumbling from the blue beam of light ahead. He even looked horrified.Ahead, a gigantic figure stood up facing the light.That figure's entire body was pitch-black, and it had a single horn on its head. It was as diabolic as a malicious ghost, and its entire body was covered in rows of sharp spikes, looking like the leader of ghosts.It faced the blue light and let out a soundless roar. It then lifted its large hand and grabbed the light.It was... kui shadow!Under the shadow of this gigantic black-colored kui, Xu Qing continued to charge toward the merfolk youth with an expressionless face.There were many wounds on his body that were caused by the beam of light, but they were healing at a speed visible to the naked eye. The killing intent in his eyes completely erupted at this moment.Be it when the merfolk youth tried to snatch the credit or the fight in the shop, Xu Qing didn't go all out. His shadow didn't move, his shadow didn't transform, and his recovery ability didn't appear.His true power and lethality was only revealed at the instant he went in for the kill."Qi and blood turning into shadow! And your cultivation! Impossible, your recovery ability, this..." The merfolk youth's expression revealed unprecedented horror. The life-and-death crisis transformed into horror in his eyes, and his words became incoherent.He wanted to open the storage bag and take out the jade slip to send a voice transmission for help. However, at this moment, the shadow seemed to be alive and could sense his thoughts. It bound his hands tightly, causing him to be unable to lift them or take out any items. Also, Xu Qing didn't waste any time and was already approaching. A cold light flashed in his right hand and a dagger appeared.Looking at the dagger, the merfolk youth let out a crazed roar. He couldn't care less about the shadow wrapping around his neck at this moment, nor did he have the time to care that the areas that were covered by the shadow were being corroded intensely. At this critical moment, his body suddenly swayed.He quickly lifted his legs, and they turned blurry in an instant, transforming into a black fishtail that blasted out with all its might toward the incoming Xu Qing. At this moment, his bloodline talent erupted completely, and an illusory merfolk figure formed outside his body, merging with his tail to form a powerful attack.Xu Qing's expression didn't change at all, and his speed also didn't slow down. He instantly closed the distance and punched out with his left hand. The shadow behind him roared and also fused into it, landing at the same time. Skin ruptured and flesh broke.The huge fishtail directly shattered into pieces, and the mermaid phantom also exploded from the impact.The ground in the surroundings trembled violently, and a mournful cry came out from the mouth of the merfolk youth. However, the water curtain in the surroundings was too thick, and his voice was firmly sealed within the alley."Curse!!" Amidst the blood-curdling screeches, the eyes of the merfolk youth who had lost the lower half of his body turned red. As he roared, the flesh and blood of his broken fishtail seemed to have gained life and started burning. They then gathered from all directions toward where Xu Qing was at an extremely fast speed, enveloping him in an instant.Although the speed of convergence was fast, it wasn't faster than Xu Qing's speed. Almost at the instant the flesh and blood enveloped him, his body left behind an afterimage that was enveloped by the mermaid's blood and flesh curse due to his extreme speed.As for his true body, it appeared behind the merfolk youth. Before the flesh and blood of the fish tail could catch up, a cold dagger had already landed in front of the merfolk youth's neck while he was still in shock."Xu Qing, I..."The merfolk youth trembled, and his voice was sharp and hurried. However, he didn't have the chance to continue speaking. After he said those three words, the coldness on the dagger spread...Xu Qing ruthlessly sliced. He didn't have the habit of listening to last words.The familiar sound of cutting echoed.Fresh blood instantly gushed out, and the merfolk youth's body twitched intensely. He was like a fish whose neck had been chopped off on a chopping board.His eyes were wide open and he wanted to turn his head, but he was unable to do so. After a few breaths of air, before his consciousness dissipated, he finally saw Xu Qing's face above him."My clothes got dirty because of you," Xu Qing said softly. This was the only thing he said from the start to the end."You..."Fresh blood was still seeping out of the merfolk youth's neck. He slowly stopped breathing. His eyes, which were still open, contained lingering longing for the world as well as disbelief. It was as though he had never expected that he, who was like heaven's chosen, would actually die here.He breathed his last.Xu Qing's expression was calm. He removed the runic treasure on his leg that boosted his speed and picked up the storage bag that the merfolk youth had no chance to open. He turned and walked out of the alley. The shadow on the merfolk youth's corpse quickly retreated and returned below Xu Qing's feet.Even when he reached the entrance of the alley, Xu Qing's footsteps didn't stop, nor did he turn his head to take a look. He merely lifted his right hand and grabbed backward.The water curtain that sealed the alley trembled intensely and began to move. please visit n0ve1b(in).ne)t  From big to small, from the outside to the inside, with the merfolk's corpse as the center, it compressed at an astonishing speed. Finally, with a bang, all the pressure from the surrounding water curtains gathered on the merfolk youth's corpse. Amidst this sound, the merfolk's corpse and the minced meat in the alley completely disintegrated. There was nothing left, and his body and soul were destroyed.Xu Qing walked away.The water curtain slowly cascaded down, turning into water droplets that landed in this quiet alley, washing away everything.It cleaned the ground of all the blood and dirt. The rising sun in the distance shone on the puddles which refracted a dazzling light.From dusk until dawn, it was only an instant to the sky. It was the same for humans.It was like life and death.

Chapter 129 Ba Burns All Life (1)
The morning wind blew at the harbor, causing the sails to flutter.However, there would always be a few strands of the wind that weren't satisfied with the swaying of the sails and attempted to lift the surface of the sea, causing the blue sea to slightly ripple. However, the sea was too deep, and the wind could only move past powerlessly. In fact, if it wasn't careful, some of the waves might even swallow it.It would be like a fish that overestimated itself and provoked an opponent it shouldn't have.On the other hand, the light of dawn was much more composed than the wind. There wasn't much desire in it, and it quietly scattered onto the numerous boats, landing on Xu Qing who was calmly walking back.Whether it was killing someone or killing a fish, to Xu Qing, the moment the other party revealed his killing intent, the outcome was already decided.He wanted to survive, so any existence that threatened his safety would touch his red line.He knew life was inherently different between different beings while alive.The teacher from the slums had laughed at himself about this difference as he told the children, including Xu Qing, that if it was a prosperous time, those in power would cover it up. However, in troubled times, this was a deeply-rooted understanding.But Xu Qing also knew that to a certain extent, this world was fair.This was because after death, everything was removed. The final result was the same direction.Dying in an unknown alley was no different from dying in a wine pool piled with precious stones."Second highness was right. He is indeed stinky." Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the sunrise and walked into the cabin. He then washed his body and lay down after the fishy smell was gone.It was his off day today, so he didn't need to go to the Homicide Department. Right now, he felt a sense of comfort from having fewer thorns in his heart. He felt that he could have a good sleep.However, before he slept, Xu Qing sat down cross-legged and took out the bamboo slip, crossing out the words 'merfolk youth' on it. He then glanced at the Diamond Sect's ancestor who was ranked first, and killing intent rose in the depths of his eyes."SoonÃ¢â‚¬¦"As he mumbled, Xu Qing took out the storage bag of the merfolk youth.He was very curious as to what items were inside.After holding it for a while, Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and muttered for a moment. The spirit energy in his body instantly erupted and gushed into the storage bag. It wasn't as difficult as he had imagined. After the death of its owner, the mark on the storage bag had long since dissipated. This allowed Xu Qing's spirit energy to enter smoothly and check the items inside.A long time later, Xu Qing involuntarily inhaled."He's that rich?" Xu Qing mumbled. Although there were only slightly more than a hundred spirit stones in the storage bag, there were a total of twelve spirit tickets with the Sixth Peak's mark on them.Each of them was worth 100 spirit stones. Such a stroke of fortune caused Xu Qing's heart to race. After all, this was a fortune he had never possessed before.However, he understood that for the sake of safety, he couldn't exchange these spirit tickets in the short term.Xu Qing calmed down and checked the other items. Other than spirit stones, there were three to five other treasures in the storage bag. As he waved his right hand, two talismans appeared before him.One was yellow, and the other was blue.The appearance of these two types of talismans shocked Xu Qing. Also, from the looks of the imprints on them, they were still mostly new. Evidently, they hadn't been used many times.Xu Qing sensed them and confirmed that the blue talisman was for protection and yellow for offense.

He could imagine that if such a situation really happened, although he could still kill it, he would have to pay a huge price to end the battle quickly."So, the usage of shadows can actually be even more varied." Xu Qing lowered his head and glanced at his own shadow. A faint light flashed in the depths of his eyes as he recalled the scene when the merfolk youth was entangled by the shadow. The shadow seemed to have come alive for a moment."Is it an illusion?" Xu Qing narrowed his eyes and stared deeply at the shadow. He then touched his chest where the purple crystal was buried. A cold glint flashed in his eyes. He had sensed it many times and knew that the purple crystal had a restraining and suppressing effect on the shadow.Regardless of whether the shadow was alive or not, Xu Qing felt that he should try suppressing it first.He attempted to pour the spirit energy into the purple crystal. The process was a little rough, and Xu Qing only succeeded after several tries. The instant he succeeded, purple light shone from his entire body, forming a suppressive force that rumbled toward the shadow on the ground.The shadow instantly distorted and dimmed a little.Xu Qing took a closer look and was satisfied.He didn't want to waste his energy guessing whether the other party was alive or not. Even if his guess was wrong and there was no possibility of the shadow coming to life, doing this would only waste some spirit energy. He repeated this a few more times and suppressed it continuously before he stopped.Finally, he restrained his gaze and lifted his head as though nothing had happened. He then stored the two talismans.Next, he checked the storage bag again and took out two items. One was a nautical chart, and the markings on it were very detailed. It was much more comprehensive compared to the standard nautical chart of the Seventh Peak's disciples.Even the location of Merfolk Island was marked on it. After Xu Qing checked, he felt that the value of this item was probably no less than a talisman.After all, for a disciple who cultivated the sea, the more comprehensive the nautical chart, the lesser the risk and the greater the harvest.Information was often more valuable than spirit stones.As for the last item, the degree of attention he paid to it even surpassed that of the talismans. This was because he had seen this item before, and he had one as well.

Chapter 130 Ba Burns All Life (2)
It was a metal plate the size of a palm. It looked like a box but wasn't one.Looking at the metal plate in front of him, Xu Qing opened his storage bag and took out one as well.He had obtained the metal plate from the scavenger campsite's Horse-Four. Later on, Fat Mountain was also greedy for this item and intentionally gave Xu Qing a chance to make a move. However, he died with resentment.After placing the two pieces of metal together, Xu Qing observed them carefully and discovered that no matter how he looked at them, they were exactly the same."What exactly is this?" Xu Qing was very curious, and his eyes slowly narrowed.During this period of time, he had been to most of the shops at the port, but he hadn't seen such an item. However, be it Fat Mountain's greed back then or the storage bag of the young merfolk now, it showed that this metal piece wasn't as ordinary as it looked."I have to find an opportunity to find out what this item is used for." Xu Qing muttered to himself, then he put everything away and looked at the sky outside. He then lay on the small bed and rested.He didn't rest for too long. Four hours later, when it was noon outside, Xu Qing opened his eyes and stretched his body. He was in good spirits and his body was in a rather full state.Most importantly, after the fight last night and today's relaxation, he had a strong feeling that his Mountains and Seas Art was very close to breaking through."I'm already at the perfected seventh level. What will happen after I reach the eighth level... I wonder if I'll have the combat strength to kill the Diamond Sect's ancestor then." Xu Qing's eyes revealed anticipation. He felt that it had taken an extremely long time for his Mountains and Seas Art to go from the seventh level to the eighth level.It was as though the Mountains and Seas Art had been brewing some sort of transformation. It was only today that he sensed the aura of a breakthrough.Xu Qing sat down cross-legged and opened the spirit-gathering array on the magic boat. After he replaced the spirit stone, he closed his eyes and began to cultivate.Time flowed by. As he immersed himself in cultivation, the afternoon slowly passed. When night fell, Xu Qing, who was meditating, suddenly felt his body tremble. At this moment, all the flesh and blood in his body suddenly tensed up as though they were contracting.The cracking sounds of the bones growing rang out in his body, and blood vessels bulged out throughout his refined body. They were like numerous ferocious pythons spreading out. It was a shocking sight, but at the same time, there was a majestic power of qi and blood in his body that continued to flourish with each heartbeat.With every beat, his qi and blood grew stronger by a notch. As the power of qi and blood grew denser and denser, Kui shadow manifested above Xu Qing's head. It faced the sky and let out a soundless roar. Its expression was distorted as though it was enduring a tremendous tempering and was going through a transformation!When an ordinary person cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art to the great circle of perfection in body refinement, Kui shadow would be completely matured. However, Xu Qing's Mountains and Seas Art had already reached the great circle of perfection in advance when he was at the seventh level. After that, he cultivated according to the cultivation art, but he didn't know what would happen, nor did he know what would happen after he broke through to the eighth level of Mountains and Seas Art. However, he could sense that during this period of time when he was in the Seven Blood Eyes, as he cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art, his physical strength was increasing. Therefore, he also wanted to see what would happen when it grew to the extreme.After all, the cultivation of body refinement was the accumulation of strength, speed, and recovery.In reality, even the creator of the Mountains and Seas Art had probably never thought that there would be someone like Xu Qing, achieving perfection in advance, so even he would not know.After all, a low-level cultivation art like the Mountains and Seas Art was prepared for people with anomalous substances in their bodies. No one had ever cultivated the Mountains and Seas Art without any anomalous substances in their bodies like Xu Qing.  Best novel online free at n0νEℓnєXт  As time flowed by, the veins on Xu Qing's body bulged more and more, and cracks seemed to appear on his skin inch by inch. A large amount of blood flowed out, and the qi and blood became even denser, as though they wanted to burst his body!It was as though Xu Qing's body had turned into a ceramic pot at this moment. The qi and blood in it erupted, and it looked like it was about to shatter.However, at this moment, for the first time, a purple light bloomed in advance. It spread out from his chest and filled his entire body. As it rapidly repaired the wound, it was also doing its best to compress it.This caused his body to be even more refined. At the same time, an intense pain that couldn't be described with words spread out in Xu Qing's body and mind.His bones were shattering, his flesh and blood were crumbling, and his entire body seemed like it couldn't hold on any longer. However, the light from the purple crystal continued to repair him. As the cycle repeated, the qi and blood became even stronger. Even the array in the cabin couldn't conceal it, causing quite a bit of it to spread out. From afar, the magic boat Xu Qing was on seemed to have been dyed red.As the dense blood and qi spread out in all directions, it also attracted the attention of the Port 79's disciples. Amidst their astonishment, Xu Qing abruptly opened his bloodshot eyes on the magic boat.The instant he opened his eyes, a heaven-shaking boom that contained a syllable of a character exploded in Xu Qing's mind like thunder. This earth-shattering sound caused Xu Qing's entire body to tremble violently. The Kui shadow above his head let out an even more intense roar at this moment. Its illusory body then directly tore apart, revealing... a newborn body!Its tall body was completely green and exuded a sense of violence, as well as an incomparably strange feeling. All of its visible skin was dry and cracked, and there were clear cracks that looked like dry land. It had a head of disheveled dry hair that draped over its shoulders, and its pair of crimson eyes were filled with madness.Its mouth was filled with fangs, and the black horn on its head was coiled with lightning. Everything revealed its savageness and cruelty. As it roared at the sky, it seemed as though it wanted to tear apart the sky that enveloped all living beings.It was as though the two poles had reversed. What appeared around it was no longer water vapor but a black flame that burned in all directions, as though it could burn everything.To be precise, it wasn't fire, but a state where everything dried up after the moisture was absorbed to the extreme.<anno data-annotation-id="f9529e5a-46c7-49e3-9106-94bf9d6f4eee">"Ba</anno>!" Xu Qing's eyes gleamed as he mumbled. This word was the syllable that echoed in his mind earlier. It was also the qi and blood shadow that appeared on its own after the Mountains and Seas Art broke through its original level!It had surpassed Kui!Xiao could move mountains, Kui could overturn seas, and Ba could burn all lives.As Xu Qing spoke, a surge of energy that was much more exuberant than before erupted in his body and spread through his entire body.Xu Qing lifted his head and abruptly stood up. The refined physical strength contained in his slender body broke through the shackles and reached a realm that surpassed the Qi Condensation Realm!At this moment, the magic boat's protective barrier couldn't hold on any longer and shattered. Even the hold of the ship was in a similar state, with many pieces of it shattered.This caused the expressions of the disciples in Port 79 who were paying attention to this to change completely. Their eyes widened and their hearts pounded in fear. A rumbling sound rang out in their minds as they all looked toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing fell silent. He didn't expect that his breakthrough in the Mountains and Seas Art would cause such a commotion. Also, he could sense that his Sea Transformation Art was circulating in his body with the eruption of the Mountains and Seas Art. It seemed like it was about to break through as well."Congratulations, Senior Brother Xu Qing!""Congratulations, Senior Brother!"Under Xu Qing's silence, the surrounding disciples on the magic boats breathed heavily and cupped their fists respectfully at Xu Qing.Respect was due to one's strength.It was the same for the title of Senior Brother.To be able to cause such a commotion during cultivation and even cause the defense of the level-six magic boat to collapse, one could imagine how powerful Xu Qing was. This was especially so for Xu Qing at this moment. In the disciples' eyes, the pressure he emitted was so intense that it caused their bodies and minds to tremble intensely!That was a kind of pressure that came from an expert!<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="f9529e5a-46c7-49e3-9106-94bf9d6f4eee">Ba is a deity/evil spirit that causes droughts.</li></ol></annotations>",
