"You're finally willing to come out?"Almost at the instant Xu Qing walked out of the vortex, he heard a voice coming from ahead.The other party's tone was calm and gave off no energy fluctuation.Xu Qing looked over. In reality, he had already seen the scene in front of him through the shadow earlier. However, now that he was seeing it with his own eyes, his heart still sank.There were originally more than a thousand Sea Corpse Race cultivators guarding this place. At this moment, these people were all kneeling from a distance.There was only one person outside the exit.This person was a youth. He wore a golden emperor's robe but he didn't have an emperor's crown. His skin was fair and there were no livor mortis spots. His aura was deep and profound and his eyes seemed to contain the stars.Appearance-wise, he was inferior to Xu Qing. However, the noble aura he emitted made him the center of attention wherever he was.He was sitting on a gigantic red lingzhi and coldly looking at Xu Qing. A ball of black fog floated beside him. The thing trapped in this fog was none other than the black iron stick.Clearly, the instant he rushed out earlier, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was captured alive by this person.As for the shadow, because it was special, it wasn't discovered. At that moment, it was hiding on the lingzhi and carefully spreading out, as though it wanted to get close and devour the other party's shadow."My name is Miao Chen. I'm a Dao Child of this generation of the Sea Corpse Race. Your companion is being chased by Elder Ying Ling. It's impossible for him to escape.""As for you, I was very curious about who dared to be so arrogant here, so I came out of seclusion to take a look." 🅃🄷🄸🅂 🄲🄷🄰🄿🅃🄴🅁 🅄🄿🄻🄾🄰🄳 🄵🄸🅁🅂🅃 🄰🅃 🄽🄾🅅🄴🄻-🄱🄸🄽.🄲🄾🄼 "I'm a little disappointed now, but your artifact spirit is still alright. Can you give it to me?" Miao Chen calmly asked.Xu Qing didn't say anything. He stood at the exit and sensed his surroundings. There was still some energy that restricted teleportation here. He had to head further out."You don't have to watch anymore. Although I don't know how you plan to escape, it is meaningless because you will become my spoils of war today." Miao Chen looked at Xu Qing."You're very talkative." Xu Qing's gaze landed on the youth.When Miao Chen heard this, he stood up and laughed. His laughter grew louder and louder until it stirred up the energy in the surroundings, forming a resonance force that created a storm in the surroundings.This storm spread out, stirring up countless dust on the ground like an avalanche. It even swept the ghost dream butterflies out of this area.The violent wind stirred up Xu Qing's long hair and caused his clothes to flutter in the wind. It was as though the wind wanted to erase him but it was obvious that it couldn't do so.At most, it would only move his hair and clothes. It couldn't shake his body or obstruct his cold gaze.Xu Qing coldly glanced at the imposing youth in front of him and suddenly rushed out toward the youth.The life lantern in his body burned and his life fires were ignited. The Golden Crow totemic tattoo on his back emitted heat. With the enhancement of his physical strength, his speed was astonishing. He directly broke through all the wind obstacles in front of him and arrived in front of Miao Chen. He then punched out fiercely.This punch contained the shadow of the Golden Crow, the power of Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, and the monstrous might brought about by his body that was like a blazing continent.As the punch landed, rumbling sounds rang out in all directions, directly smashing into Miao Chen's chest.Miao Chen's eyes were filled with disdain. Just as he was about to wave his hand, the lingzhi below him suddenly turned from red to black. One eye after another opened in this blackness.The opening and closing of these eyes formed a strange force that caused Miao Chen's movements to pause.At the same time, the black iron stick that the Diamond Sect's ancestor was on suddenly shone with lightning runes. He directly destroyed a few lightning runes for more power.It broke through the black fog and rushed out, heading straight for the youth's neck at an astonishing speed. There was also a series of mind-stirring bell chimes that rang from the stick.Clearly, the Diamond Sect's ancestor had been trapped earlier because he had been laying out a trap of his own. It wasn't that he couldn't escape, but he wanted to wait for Xu Qing to attack before showing his strength at the most critical moment.At that moment, when he acted together with the shadow and Xu Qing, his might was truly astonishing.Miao Chen's expression changed for the first time. He couldn't dodge Xu Qing's punch. At the critical moment, his body suddenly swayed and a palm-sized jade coffin instantly appeared above his head. As soon as the coffin appeared, treasure light shone and flowed down like water, permeating the surroundings of the youth, forming a protective barrier. Xu Qing's fist landed on this protective barrier.An earth-shattering boom echoed out. As Miao Chen's body rolled back like a kite with a broken string, the Diamond Sect's ancestor chased after him and stabbed fiercely. Although he didn't pierce through the protective barrier, the lightning spread in and bombarded Miao Chen's entire body.The shadow also appeared behind Miao Chen. The tree shadow formed a blurry outline and opened its mouths to suck fiercely. Immediately, a lot of anomalous substances exited from Miao Chen's entire body.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing rushed over again, punching out one punch after another at Miao Chen's protective barrier. The heavenly saber manifested and slashed ruthlessly.Miao Chen's body was thrown a thousand feet away and created a deep pit when he landed. The expressions of the kneeling sea corpse cultivators in the distance shook. Just as they were about to approach, a furious roar rang out from the deep pit."All of you, back off. I will handle this!"As this furious roar rang out, a ball of life fire fluctuations suddenly flickered from the deep pit. A figure walked out. His hair was disheveled and his eyes revealed intense killing intent. As he walked out, the second ball of life fire in his body was ignited.After that, the third ball of life fire and the fourth ball of life fire were instantly ignited.As a Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race, he had opened 120 magic apertures, forming four balls of life fire.Such a heaven's chosen should usually be at the critical moment of breaking through. Coupled with his previous words, it could be seen that he was originally in closed-door cultivation. However, such a major event had happened in the Sea Corpse Race. Clearly, there weren't enough people left. Or perhaps it was because of his curiosity that he came.However, he didn't expect Xu Qing to combine his attacks with strange methods to suppress him immediately. This caused him to feel a little embarrassed, so he erupted in full force.The instant he erupted, Xu Qing's figure approached again. Under the burning of his life lantern, he possessed the cultivation of three fires. Coupled with Golden Crow Refines All Life, Xu Qing's true combat strength had reached four fires.He attacked again and suppressed the youth who walked out of the deep pit.As a Dao Child, Miao Chen was naturally extraordinary. With a wave of his hand, droplets of black liquid instantly formed around him. In the blink of an eye, they gathered into a black sea that swept fiercely toward Xu Qing.RUMBLEThe churning black sea formed a large mouth that fiercely devoured Xu Qing.Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes but he knew that he couldn't stay here for long. Hence, without any hesitation, the spirit sea in his 65 magic apertures erupted and directly spread out outside his body, forming a magic power pool with a range of 10,000 feet.Relying on his dense magic power, he ruthlessly suppressed the youth.The black sea formed by the youth's spell instantly collapsed. Xu Qing's magic power pool also dissipated. At the next instant, four fires burned ferociously in the youth's body and he suddenly appeared in front of Xu Qing, grabbing at his heart.Xu Qing dodged slightly then kneed the youth.At the next instant, the black iron stick whistled over from the side. All the lightning runes on it shone and another ten or so exploded. It suddenly appeared in front of Miao Chen and stabbed his neck.Miao Chen's expression changed. Just as he was about to dodge, the shadow pounced up from the ground again.Xu Qing also erupted with speed. The fiendish fire in his body rose as he slammed his palm toward Miao Chen's forehead.At this critical moment, Miao Chen let out a low roar. The power of the four balls of life fire in his body spread out with all their might, forming a powerful impact force and suppression of the cultivation base, causing the Diamond Sect's ancestor to let out a blood-curdling cry and roll back. Xu Qing was also the first to receive the brunt of the force.. His internal organs shook and killing intent flashed in his eyes.The shadow was also scattered by this force, but there was still a wisp that touched the youth's body and infiltrated his body. It arrived at his dantian and pounced toward a ball of life fire like it had extinguished the Spirit Breath Lantern back then.As it pounced over, the ball of life fire instantly swayed and showed signs of extinguishing.The mind of the Dao Child shook violently. The life fires in his body erupted and even the Heavenly Palace faintly appeared to suppress the shadow as he tried to stop the life fire from being extinguished.He was not able to care about other things which gave Xu Qing a chance.The coldness in Xu Qing's eyes flared up at this moment. In such a life-and-death battle, he couldn't care less about exposing himself. The Golden Crow formed behind him and as black flames surged into the sky and pressed down on the Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race.The Golden Crow behind him let out a shocking cry and also pounced over. The moment Miao Chen was aware of the danger, black flames covered him and sucked fiercely at his head!Refine!Xu Qing was prepared to use the opportunity exchanged by the shadow to refine the other party alive!The two of them attacked incomparably quickly. Outsiders couldn't see their movements clearly at all. The Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child seemed to be suppressed but he was actually extremely strong. Xu Qing had to use all his methods to obtain this decisive opportunity.When experts fought, being able to see and create the decisive opportunity was extremely important.Following the ruthlessness in Xu Qing's eyes and the devouring by Golden Crow Refines All Life, the Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child let out a mournful cry. For the first time, horror appeared in his eyes. He clearly felt that his qi and blood were being extracted and his head was melting.This was indeed the case. From afar, the qi and blood of the Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child were spreading out. And, his right face that was facing the Golden Crow was indeed melting!His right ear had disappeared and the right side of his face was completely disfigured!This scene caused the expressions of the sea corpse cultivators in the distance to change. They couldn't care less about the Dao Child's instructions and rushed over.

Chapter 270 Slipping Away
However, they were some distance away and couldn't arrive in time.At this critical moment, the Dao Child let out a low roar and took out that jade coffin again. The coffin opened; a sea of light spread from it and a finger stretched out.As soon as this finger appeared, it directly pointed in front of Xu Qing.An intense sense of danger rose in Xu Qing's mind. He retreated immediately without any hesitation. The Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child finally caught his breath and quickly retreated, trying to distance himself.However, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who had suffered consecutively, was anxious at this moment. He saw that the shadow had made many contributions in this incident. This gave him a strong sense of urgency. He felt that if this continued, he would definitely be discarded.His eyes were bloodshot. He roared and didn't hesitate to sacrifice several lightning runes in exchange for extreme speed. His speed soared and he instantly pierced through the arm of the panicked Dao Child.Blood gushed out and the Dao Child's expression changed drastically. As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he quickly retreated and returned excitedly.From afar, the two people on the battlefield were retreating. However, compared to the sorry state of the Dao Child, Xu Qing looked to be in a much better state.However, he wasn't arrogant. He was very clear that Miao Chen's combat strength was definitely not just these. It was just that he had snatched the initiative; his storm-like attacks, the strangeness of the shadow, and the strength of the body refined by Golden Crow Refines All Life caused Miao Chen to fall into danger almost instantly.Although it was a pity that he couldn't kill the other party, Xu Qing understood that he couldn't stay anymore.As he retreated, his speed erupted as he sped into the distance. The shadow and the black iron stick also got close and fled together.As for the sea corpse cultivators who had rushed over from the surroundings, more than half of them stayed with the Dao Child. The remaining portion was about to chase after Xu Qing but after taking a few steps, they spat out blood as the poison that Xu Qing had scattered took effect.Dao Child Miao Chen, who was also poisoned, was protected by the Sea Corpse Race cultivators. He angrily pushed away the surrounding sea corpse cultivators. His eyes were filled with killing intent and the grievance he felt reached the extreme.When he was alive, he was a heaven's chosen of the Spirit Jade Race. He sensed 120 magic apertures and transformed into a sea corpse after he died in an accident. He was also valued by the Sea Corpse Race and was listed in King's Sequence. Under their full nurturing, he finally stepped into the four fires realm.It could be said that regardless of whether it was the Spirit Jade or the Sea Corpse Race, he had never suffered such humiliation other than the time he died. The right side of his face was disfigured and his right ear had melted. This caused him, who cared a lot about the appearance, to be seething with madness and anger."I'm going to kill you!" The Dao Child touched the right side of his face. The fires in his body burned violently as he gave chase.Xu Qing, who was in the distance, turned his head and narrowed his eyes. Just as he was about to attack again, his expression changed.In the distant sky, three energy fluctuations erupted into the sky. The strength of these auras surpassed the Foundation Building realm. They were Golden Core experts of the Sea Corpse Race. There were a total of three of them who were rushing over from the horizon.Their energy fluctuations caused the weather itself to change. It was like the anger of the heavens, wanting to punish all living beings.Xu Qing took a deep breath. The sense of danger spread out from every inch of his flesh. He didn't stop at all and circulated his cultivation base fully. He fled even faster and ran into the distance.At the same time, there was also an explosion behind him and a faint roar echoed through the area."Thief, I don't believe that a mere invisibility technique of yours can escape the search of my Sea Corpse Race!!"Xu Qing was familiar with this furious roar. It was none other than the Golden Core boy who had chased after the captain earlier. From his words, it was obvious that the captain had actually escaped from his pursuit.​ This caused Xu Qing to have more guesses about the captain's identity and cultivation base. At the same time, he became even more anxious. He was very clear that the captain was treated as the chief culprit and had attracted the attention of countless people. Once the captain wasn't found, he would be the target of all this attention.Xu Qing looked at the black iron stick.The Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick didn't hesitate at all. At the next instant, another seven to eight lightning runes on the iron stick exploded in exchange for an even faster speed. He dragged Xu Qing and rushed forward with all his might.With the help of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, Xu Qing escaped much faster. In an instant, he crossed a thousand feet and directly stepped out of the edge of the forbidden area to the outside world. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ The Golden Core boy behind him roared angrily. When the divine senses of the Golden Core experts swept in all directions with terrifying fluctuations, Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all to activate the disorder teleportation talisman.In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing's figure blurred. At the next moment, a cold snort rang out from the distant sky.It was a three-headed and six-armed sea corpse. His Golden Core energy fluctuation was extremely powerful, surpassing that of the Golden Core boy.From such a far distance, he pointed at Xu Qing."Restrict!"As soon as he spoke, the space around Xu Qing was sealed. However, the disorder teleportation talisman was an extremely powerful item. It ignored the restriction of the Golden Core and was still operating. In fact, the teleportation fluctuations had already formed and it was about to teleport Xu Qing away."Hmm?" The eyes of the Golden Core sea corpse cultivator in the distant sky narrowed. He quickly took out a bead and crushed it!"Break!"As soon as he finished speaking, the disorder teleportation talisman in Xu Qing's hand couldn't withstand it anymore. The bead seemed to have linked with the talisman; when it broke, the teleportation talisman was also destroyed. Xu Qing was enveloped by the divine ability from the Golden Core sea corpse cultivator.This force contained the intent to destroy everything, causing the flesh in Xu Qing's body to feel like they were about to tear apart and wither.Xu Qing's eyes turned bloodshot as he took out another disorder teleportation talisman and activated it.He had a total of three disorder teleportation talismans. He had used one of them on the dragon carriage and one of them had been broken earlier. Now, this was the last one.At the same time, his magic ship manifested to block the force. At the next instant, his magic ship collapsed and shattered into pieces. However, the trace of Blinding flesh inside still blocked the will of extermination, causing the attack that was supposed to kill him to turn into a serious injury.Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood as the bones in his body shattered. The life fires in his body were instantly extinguished and his entire body withered like it was rotting. He was also directly thrown up by this huge force. Many parts of his body collapsed and shattered. His soul was unstable as well.However, with this obstruction, his last disorder teleportation talisman was also exchanged for an opportunity to teleport. Although the Golden Core cultivator who was rapidly approaching attacked again, Xu Qing's disorder teleportation talisman was given to him by the Deputy Peak Lord of the Seventh Peak. It was an item refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator and had its own extraordinary points.At that moment, when he used it twice in a row and his figure was covered in blood, the teleportation power erupted explosively and Xu Qing's body instantly disappeared!Almost at the instant he disappeared, the Golden Core expert descended and landed at the place where Xu Qing had disappeared, causing a deep pit to appear on the ground. The surrounding area shook intensely."Two teleportation talismans refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator. This person's identity is definitely extraordinary. However, he has been hit by my Spirit Nether Curse, and with his cultivation base, he will definitely die in three days at most!" The expression of the Golden Core expert was ugly. He turned and headed straight for the forbidden area.While the Sea Corpse Race searched crazily in the vicinity, a slight distortion appeared in the empty space in the distance.That distorted place looked like there was nothing there, but in reality, the person hiding inside was none other than the captain.His entire body was covered in injuries and one of his arms was already crippled. There was also a huge wound at his waist that was about to split him into two, causing his aura to be extremely weak.He was holding a rainbow-colored shell in his remaining hand. The rainbow light emitted by the shell had a miraculous concealment effect, causing his existence and aura to disappear without a trace.This was also the captain's way to escape the pursuit of the Golden Core cultivators. However, at this moment, he was a little dumbfounded.He had watched helplessly as Xu Qing crushed the disorder teleportation talisman and left. Originally, he wanted to come over and greet him but the scene he saw caused his mind to tremble."Gone? Gone? Teleported away? I…"The captain suddenly wailed inwardly. He felt that this matter had become a little strange. He had only taken a bite, but why did the statue's nose explode?In reality, even now, he still felt that this matter was unbelievable. It wasn't that he hadn't suspected Xu Qing, but it just so happened that the nose exploded right after he took the bite, causing him to feel this was possibly related to him."The old man didn't say that it would be like this. Back then, he didn't do such a big thing…" The captain let out a long sigh. As he frowned and carefully fled, pride rose in his heart."However, this matter can also indirectly mean that I'm better than the old man. This… was exciting!"The captain took a deep breath and felt smug. Rumbling sounds filled the sky and the auras of Golden Core cultivators erupted. Even energy fluctuations from Nascent Soul cultivators appeared.This caused the captain to instantly lower his head. He lay on the ground and moved bit by bit. On one hand, he had to hide. On the other hand, he was also afraid that his movements would be too big and he would really split in two…"At worst, I'll leave half of my body behind…"Three days passed.As this matter fermented, the entire Sea Corpse Race was completely enraged and searched crazily in all directions. To the Sea Corpse Race, this matter was extremely humiliating.This was because the scene that the Golden Core boy was most worried about had happened.Even after three days had passed, the nose of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue still didn't recover.At that moment, the Golden Core boy was standing in front of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue with his head lowered. Beside him stood a middle-aged cultivator.This middle-aged cultivator wasn't a human. He had two wings on his back and his aura was restrained. However, as he stood there, the Golden Core boy at the side shook incomparably."Marquis Anzuo, I…""Ying Ling, the king is furious." The middle-aged cultivator lifted his head and stared at the statue that looked extremely odd due to not having the nose. He also stared at the actions of the few sea corpse cultivators who were probing and trying to repair it.The Golden Core boy's body trembled even more intensely.Not long later, the sea corpse cultivators at the nose of the statue arrived in front of Marquis Anzuo with grievance and helplessness and respectfully spoke."Marquis, the destruction is very strange. We are unable to repair it, maybe there is hope if we can get back the two missing pieces."Marquis Anzuo fell silent. After a long time, he spoke softly."What you mean is that one of the holy objects of our Sea Corpse Race, this Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue will have to show its noseless appearance in front of all our clansmen from now on, is that right?"

Chapter 271 Wanted List!
The wind was gentle and the sun was bright.The sea was filled with waves.The noon sun, the blue sky, and the black sea made for a gorgeous scenery.This was even more so when swordfishes flew out of the sea and stirred up some waves. At the same time, the seawater under the sunlight also reflected a rainbow light.The beauty of the rainbow and the warmth of the sunlight washed away some of the mystery of the black, cold sea. It seemed to be tranquil at this moment.This sea area was very far from the Seven Blood Eyes and was closer to the territory of the Sea Corpse Race. Due to the war, there weren't many merchant ships moving in this region. Moreover, due to the density of anomalous substances, there were clearly a lot of large sea beasts in the sea.A mosasaur was moving rapidly under the sea. Its sinister face, sharp teeth, and the aura it emitted caused most of the sea beasts on the way to scramble away.With no obstruction, the mosasaur's speed continued to increase. However, if a Golden Core cultivator investigated carefully and stared at this mosasaur, they would discover that this mosasaur wasn't a living creature!It was formed by a spell and there was a youth sitting cross-legged inside.The black canopy above the youth's head flowed with waves of flames, enveloping him and hiding his aura.His clothes were tattered and he was in a sorry state. Many parts of his body were sunken and his aura was unstable. His injuries were extremely serious and there was a faint black thread in his body.This thread wasn't corporeal but an illusory existence. However, it was deeply buried in the youth's flesh and blood, obstructing his recovery. Moreover, wherever it passed, his flesh would wither and he even felt as though his body was about to break.The youth was none other than Xu Qing, who had escaped from the Sea Corpse Race.His teleportation had gone quite smoothly. Although he didn't directly enter the sea, he still appeared on the coastline.Relying on his disguise, he endured his injuries and used the fastest speed to dive into the sea, escaping far away. During the process, he sensed some experts from the Sea Corpse Race. However, he was able to flee safely.The main reason for this was that the Sea Corpse Race had placed most of their energy on the captain. Although they were also looking for Xu Qing, there was clearly a difference.At this moment, ten days had passed since the nose of the Sea Corpse Race's ancestral corpse statue collapsed.In these ten days, Xu Qing had been escaping in the mosasaur. However, what made his heart gloomy was that his injuries were recovering extremely slowly in these ten days.That illusory black thread was affecting his recovery.This thread came from the Golden Core sea corpse cultivator with three heads and six arms. Although Xu Qing escaped, this black thread appeared in his body after he left.This thread was very tenacious. Xu Qing couldn't kill it even when he burned his life fires, but when he tried to suppress it with the life lantern, it seemed to be afraid. However, Xu Qing's cultivation was clearly unable to display the true power of the life lantern. Hence, he could only make it stop being active and not kill it.Xu Qing manifested the black umbrella and blocked its aura from spreading out. He was also using Golden Crow Refines All Life in these ten days to refine the black thread.The level of Golden Crow Refines All Life was extremely high. Even though Xu Qing's cultivation base couldn't unleash all its power, he was able to slowly grind the black thread down along with the power of the life lantern. In the end, he even arranged for the shadow to devour it. With the power from three sources, it finally showed signs of dissipating.This lasted for another seven days. After half a month, Xu Qing finally eliminated the black thread.The moment it completely dissipated, he spat out a large mouthful of black blood.This blood clearly contained lethal poison. Just as it was about to taint the mosasaur and spread to the seawater outside, Xu Qing quickly took out a small bottle and stored the blood he spat out.He could sense that the mouthful of blood he spat out contained a poison he had never seen before. Or to be precise, this wasn't poison. He could sense countless black bugs that were difficult to detect with the naked eye in this blood.The black thread had been formed by a large number of these black bugs."I need to study it. This blood can become one of my trump cards." Xu Qing drew in a deep breath. After carefully storing the bottle, he focused on healing his injuries.Without the obstruction of the black thread, Xu Qing recovered quickly. During this recovery, he recalled his harvest this time around, and felt greatly satisfied when he felt the burning of the 65 magic apertures in his body."It was worth it!" Xu Qing mumbled as he thought of an item in his storage bag. That item was over 100 feet in size and its shape was irregular. It was difficult to guess what it was at a glance.Only those who had truly seen its complete shape would know that this item… was a piece of the nose of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue of the Sea Corpse Race!However, after leaving the range of the Sea Corpse Race, the material of the nose changed and it turned gray like an ordinary item. At the same time, it no longer gave off any mysterious feeling.Even so, Xu Qing couldn't bear to throw it away. He felt that this thing might have another use. After all… this was the nose of the Sea Corpse Race's holy item. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆  Xu Qing didn't know what kind of storm would eventually form from what he had done. Although he had some guesses, he didn't think that this matter would be extremely serious.At most, he and the captain had swallowed some spirit liquid. At most… the captain had taken a bite of the toe of the statue and caused the internal instability of the statue to collapse.It was nothing much. Xu Qing had heard the captain mention the strangeness of the nine ancestral corpse statues and knew that they had extremely high recovery abilities. The statue might have already recovered to its original state.As for the captain…"He won't die." Xu Qing didn't know why, but he kept feeling that the captain wouldn't die so easily. Hence, he didn't think too much about it. He continued to sit in the merfolk dragon and controlled it to head to the merfolk island as he healed his injuries.He was going to return to the Seven Blood Eyes.However, this place was too far from the Seven Blood Eyes. If he went straight toward it, it would probably be difficult to reach it even in a year. Using the teleportation array on the merfolk island was the most convenient.Moreover, as a war participant, teleportation was free. Hence, this became Xu Qing's first choice.While Xu Qing was recuperating and hurrying on his way, the entire Sea Corpse Race was in a huge uproar. Firstly, the matter about the nose of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue was gradually spread.To the Sea Corpse Race, this was a shocking matter. Almost as soon as the news spread, it spread crazily among all their members and ignited their fury.This was especially so for those members of the Sea Corpse Race who had been transformed by the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue. Their emotions fluctuated even more intensely. There was a complicated and subtle connection between them and the Seventh Ancestral Corpse.Therefore, the disappearance of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse's nose was the greatest humiliation for them. What caused this humiliation to reach its peak was the result of their investigation. It was confirmed that the two thieves were Foundation Building disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes.Foundation Building realm was very strong in the eyes of mortals but to a race, it was nothing at all. How could the entire Sea Corpse Race not be furious when such low-level cultivators committed a monstrous crime in their base camp?Not only were the ordinary clansmen furious, but even the Sea Corpse Race's nobles, the king, and the old antiques were furious.After this matter spread like a storm in the Sea Corpse Race's territory, it was inevitable that it would affect the war with the Seven Blood Eyes.A large number of Sea Corpse Race members were rioting and going crazy on the battlefield. Although this was bravery, it was this venting bravery that caused their battle formations to change and cause many unstable situations.In war, there were commanders who were good at making use of the anger of their subordinates, but it was a double-edged sword. If they were careless, they would collapse on their own.As for the Seven Blood Eyes, how could that group of cunning old foxes let go of this opportunity? They immediately increased their efforts, causing the scale of the war to increase repeatedly in this short half a month.The higher-ups of the Seven Blood Eyes had been surprised at first. However, they quickly knew the reason and understood that two Seven Blood Eyes disciples had done such an earth-shattering thing in the Sea Corpse Race.They were also shocked when they heard of the news. The peak lords immediately looked at Old Master Seventh. From what they knew, only Old Master Seventh's Seventh Peak's disciples would do such a thing.Sixty years ago, Old Master Seventh had done a similar thing. It was just that it wasn't as astonishing as it was now.Old Master Seventh was also stunned. His expression became a little strange, as though he had thought of something but didn't say anything.However, no matter what, this matter caused the momentum of the Seven Blood Eyes to increase greatly. The ancestor was even happier. He personally said that he would reward these two Seven Blood Eyes disciples with great contributions.As for the names of these two disciples who had done such a big thing, before the Seven Blood Eyes could investigate, the Sea Corpse Race had already helped them find them.As their background was dug out, the Sea Corpse Race quickly changed their wanted list!This wanted list had existed even before the war. The first on it was Xue Lianzi, and the reward was extremely generous. The second was Old Master Seventh, and the few people behind him were the peak lords and deputy peak lords.Golden Core cultivators were listed after over ten people.But now, the list had been updated.The Wanted List.First, Chen Erniu. This person is a disciple of the Seventh Peak and is currently the director of the Homicide Department. He is the main culprit in the blasphemy against my Sea Corpse Race's Ancestral Corpse.

Chapter 272 Fame (1)
The war between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race had been going on for half a year.The range of the war grew larger and larger, and more and more allies joined.Not only was the frontline battlefield continuing to advance and shift, but other areas in the Forbidden Sea were also affected.Strategic bases were established in the territories of many nonhuman races. Many small-scale battles erupted left and right.Such a large-scale war naturally attracted the attention of many races.Hence, although the change in the wanted list was an unforeseen event between the Sea Corpse Race and the Seven Blood Eyes, it attracted the attention of the other races.In an instant, the focus of most of the races in the Forbidden Sea gathered on this ranking.The names of Chen Erniu and Xu Qing were known by countless nonhuman races, humanoid races, and human forces.The discussions about the two of them became increasingly intense.There were many who were tempted by the bounty given by the Sea Corpse Race. There were even experts of the Seven Blood Eyes who felt greed because of such enormous rewards.After all, the Sea Corpse Race provided the reward to anyone who could complete the task. Any races or even the disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes would be rewarded as long as they completed the mission.In fact, it wouldn't be a problem for the Sea Corpse Race to specially transform the person who completed the mission and make them their clansman.Moreover, once those people became a member of the Sea Corpse Race, they would step into the King's Sequence.The resources of the entire Sea Corpse Race would be focused on them. Just this was enough to make many people envious. The only worry was the failure rate of transforming into the Sea Corpse Race.After all, this transformation wasn't a sure thing. There was a certain risk.However, compared to the rewards, it would be worth it.This was because those in the King's Sequence of the Sea Corpse Race would have the status of true crown princes. They were also known as Dao Child to the outside world.Miao Chen, who had half of his face destroyed by Xu Qing, was in the King's Sequence. He was also the only one in the King's Sequence of the Sea Corpse Race so far.Hence, this bounty could be said to be unprecedented. From this, one could see the anger and determination of the Sea Corpse Race.Their goal in putting up such a bounty was clearly to either kill Xu Qing and the captain or make it difficult for them to take a single step in the Forbidden Sea in the future. They would have enemies everywhere.The vast majority of enemies would not reveal their motives, so it was difficult to distinguish them.This way, Xu Qing and the captain would not be able to trust others in the future. They would have to be on guard at all times.The thing was Xu Qing had this personality to begin with… At that moment, he was in the mosasaur's body and moving toward the merfolk island. He had no idea about what was going on in the outside world.His identity token that could receive information from the outside world had long lost its effect because it was too far from the merfolk island.This also allowed Xu Qing to better immerse himself in his recovery.About 20 days later, Xu Qing's injuries finally healed.The moment he completely recovered, Xu Qing pondered for a moment and didn't choose to leave the mosasaur.His magic ship had already collapsed, so using the mosasaur to travel was the most convenient method. It saved him trouble and effort."I wonder what's going on outside now? Did the captain escape? How did the Sea Corpse Race handle this?"When he was still seven to eight days away from the merfolk island, Xu Qing looked in the direction of the merfolk island and mumbled inwardly."I can't be so crazy in the future. I get myself injured every time… If I continue this, I might die earlier than the captain."Xu Qing looked at his body as he recalled his journey and sighed.If one wanted to survive in this cruel world and live a better life, they usually had to work hard to become stronger.These two thoughts were contradictory and made people helpless."I'm still too weak."Xu Qing thought of the four fires heaven's chosen of the Sea Corpse Race, Miao Chen.This was the first true four fires cultivator he had seen.Although the captain had also revealed the same thing when he was chased by the Golden Core boy, Xu Qing felt that the captain's cultivation was bizarre and wasn't very clear.However, Miao Chen was different. He really had four life fires!Xu Qing felt that such people should be rare. However, when he thought about how vast the Wanggu Continent was and how there were countless races, he wasn't too surprised.Xu Qing was very clear that he had gained the advantage in the fight with Miao Chen because he had snatched the initiative.In addition, the shadow, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, and his body enhanced by Golden Crow Refines All Life were the factors which led to him finally suppressing the other party.The next time they met, the other party would definitely be vigilant, and it would be much more difficult for him to suppress the latter.However, Xu Qing analyzed that Miao Chen would also find it extremely difficult to suppress him."Four balls of life fire…"Xu Qing's eyes revealed desire. He had now fully stepped into the mid-stage Foundation Building realm. Coupled with the life lantern and the enhancement from Golden Crow Refines All Life, he could fight against four fires.This combat strength already allowed him to stand at the peak of the Foundation Building realm. He could even escape from a Golden Core cultivator and neutralize some damage. To others, he was already extremely strong. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ However, Xu Qing was not satisfied."There are still 25 magic apertures left before I can ignite the third ball of life fire… At that time, at the Foundation Building realm, unless I encounter other life lantern cultivators, I can suppress everyone. I should be able to live a little better.""It's too slow to open the magic aperture the normal way."

Chapter 273 Fame (2)
Xu Qing muttered. He suddenly hoped that the captain would return soon.This was because with the captain's madness, Xu Qing felt that it wouldn't be difficult for him to form the third ball of life fire by participating in similar matters of the Sea Corpse Race a few more times."When the captain returns, I'm going to ask him if there are other places to make it big."Xu Qing made a decision.As for the thought of not continuing with the madness, he threw it to the side."I have no choice. My cultivation is too slow. In order to open more magic apertures, I'll have to look for an opportunity to take the risk again. When my magic apertures are fully opened, I won't take such risks anymore."Xu Qing nodded in deep agreement at his thoughts.Just like that, days passed. Five days later, when he was still three days away from the merfolk island, Xu Qing's identity token vibrated.He took it out and saw a large number of familiar missions refreshing rapidly.At first glance, there was nothing different. Xu Qing checked around and noticed that at the top of the many missions, there was a Hero Rankings. Xu Qing knew that this ranking was the wanted list of the Sea Corpse Race.It recorded the bounty provided by the Sea Corpse Race for killing the Seven Blood Eyes' cultivators. However, it wasn't free to check, so Xu Qing didn't use it.At this moment, he swept his gaze over and hesitated.He felt that what he and the captain had done in the Sea Corpse Race was neither big nor small. There was a certain chance that they would be wanted.Hence, he wanted to take a look but discovered that it actually cost 100 spirit stones. This made Xu Qing feel that it wasn't worth it.The instant Xu Qing was about to give up on buying, as the mosasaur got closer and closer to the territory of the merfolk island, more tremors appeared in his identity token.They were private messages sent by everyone who knew him."Senior Brother Xu Qing, are you back?""All hail Senior Brother Xu Qing!!!"There were too many messages. Xu Qing looked at them in surprise."Senior Brother Xu Qing, I think you must have a lot of messages now and you might not be able to see my message. However, I'm so excited. After I saw your name and the things you did, I couldn't sleep for days in excitement and worry. There are thousands of words I want to say, but they turned into the first seven words of my <anno data-annotation-id="cb404623-4dcb-4a60-915a-9ba46b6e427b">message</anno>."This message was from Ding Xue.Xu Qing only glanced past the first seven words of Ding Xue's message and didn't pay much attention.This was because an even greater matter filled his mind. He realized that the matter in the Sea Corpse Race had been exposed. He immediately flipped through the other messages.All the other messages also mentioned this matter.Xu Qing quickly looked through them and didn't hesitate to spend 100 spirit stones to buy the viewing rights of the Hero Rankings.When he opened it and noticed that he was ranked second, his eyes narrowed.He then looked at the first place."Chen Erniu?"Xu Qing fell silent. He clearly knew that the other party was the captain but he was still stunned by this name.He suddenly realized that the captain had never mentioned his name. Perhaps it had a lot to do with the latter thinking that his name was a little old-fashioned.Xu Qing carefully checked the rankings. After a long time, he took a deep breath and frowned slightly. He then looked at the piece of the nose in his storage bag.On the way back, he had already analyzed it. Seeing that the Sea Corpse Race's reaction was so intense, he felt that there was a high chance that the explosion caused by the unstable fluctuation due to Golden Crow Refines All Life was unrecoverable.However, he felt that this matter was somewhat unbelievable."Could it be that the captain did something crazy again after I left?"Xu Qing fell silent. However, no matter what, his name had spread everywhere now, causing him to feel a little uneasy.He didn't like to show off. This didn't match the understanding he had gained from his life since he was young, nor did it match the tradition of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes."It's all the captain's fault for causing such a huge commotion. How good would it have been if he had just left back then!"Xu Qing shook his head and stared at the rankings for a long time. He had already realized the monstrous anger of the Sea Corpse Race and the endless killing intent contained in these rankings.This was because not to mention others, even Xu Qing himself couldn't help but feel his heart racing when he saw the bounty reward for Captain Chen Erniu.He could easily imagine how tempted other people must be."It wasn't easy for me to settle down for some time. Now, I have to be vigilant against everyone. The sect isn't safe either. However, compared to the chaos in the outside world and the fact that I did such a big thing, I don't think people with ulterior motives would dare to reveal their malice in the sect."Xu Qing rapidly analyzed the pros and cons. In the next few days, he was extremely careful and even used the shadow to hide the fluctuations of his identity token.It was the same for him. He used the disguise item and changed his appearance before slowly approaching the merfolk island.He had to go to the merfolk island. If he were to travel alone, not only would it take an extremely long time to return to the Seven Blood Eyes, but it would also be easy for accidents to occur on the way. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ Due to the matter on the rankings, after Xu Qing returned, he immediately stepped into the nearest Image Island.He headed straight for the teleportation array.Fortunately, there weren't many cultivators here now and most of them were on the battlefield. Hence, Xu Qing's return didn't attract any attention.He didn't waste any time and quickly arrived at the teleportation array.Xu Qing took a deep breath and glanced at the surrounding Fifth Peak's disciples in charge of the array formation. After that, he quickly took out his identity jade slip and pressed it to the side.Fluctuations from the array formation spread out. His identity had been verified and the teleportation was about to begin.At this moment, a Fifth Peak's disciple in charge of the teleportation array glanced at the teleportation stone at the side and noticed the name of the person using the teleportation array.The instant he saw this name, he was stunned for a moment. After that, his eyes abruptly widened and he turned his head to look at Xu Qing on the teleportation array."Xu Qing!"At the next instant, Xu Qing's figure disappeared under the light of the teleportation array.At the same time, in the Sea Corpse Race's territory, in a forest of red withered giant trees, an armored giant with half of its body rotting was sitting and meditating.Just that half of its body was over 5,000 feet tall, towering above the withered trees in the surroundings.Above his head sat a youth in an emperor's robe.It was Miao Chen.Half of his face was disfigured and the flesh and bones in it were displaced. Even the ear on it was gone, causing his originally handsome face to look sinister. His noble temperament was also gone.In front of him, a woman in a long purple and green dress, with her face covered, was kneeling and speaking softly."Your Highness, all the healing items in the race can't neutralize the corrosive power in your wound. Only the king and the marquises have a way to forcefully neutralize it. However, the king said... that you have to handle your matters yourself. Kill that Xu Qing and he will heal you.""What do you mean? Back then, when you took advantage of the weak Spirit Jade and schemed against me, why didn't you make such a demand? Could it be that you guys have taken a fancy to Chen Erniu and Xu Qing, and are scheming to kill them before transforming them? Sea Corpse Race, a shameless race, scram!!"The youth lifted his head, looking even more sinister. The woman's body trembled and she hurriedly left.After the woman left, the youth's bloodshot eyes revealed intense killing intent. His heart was also filled with indescribable grievance.As a Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race, a Perfected Foundation Building cultivator, and a heaven's chosen with four life fires, he had actually lost to an unknown person and was humiliated."Xu Qing, I'm not done with you. If I don't kill you, my mind won't be clear!!"<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="cb404623-4dcb-4a60-915a-9ba46b6e427b">This is a wordplay, so it doesn't translate well.

Chapter 274 The Captain Did It!
Xu Qing was vigilant, so the instant he teleported, he noticed the expression of that Fifth Peak's disciple.Even though there was only shock on the latter's face and no other thoughts could be seen, Xu Qing felt that since even he was tempted by the bounty, there was no reason for others not to be tempted."Besides, my enemies in the Sea Corpse Race include that Dao Child as well."Since the nose of the statue couldn't recover, it could only mean that his Golden Crow Refines All Life was too domineering and what it devoured couldn't be restored.There was a high chance that half of the Dao Child's face and ear wouldn't be able to recover."He must hate me to the core. I have to find an opportunity to get rid of him."With this thought in mind, as the light of the teleportation array flickered, when everything in front of him became blurry and gradually became clear, Xu Qing returned to the Seven Blood Eyes.As soon as he teleported over, familiar clamor and bustling sounds entered Xu Qing's perception.Very soon, light flowed over and the Seven Blood Eyes' city was reflected in Xu Qing's eyes.The first thing that appeared in front of him was the crowd waiting in line for the teleportation, as well as two disciples who were registering the people coming and going not far away.These two disciples, a man and a woman, were both wearing gray Daoist robes.Xu Qing's gaze swept past the two of them. He felt that they were a little familiar, but didn't pay much attention to them.However, the moment he walked out, the purple Daoist robe he was wearing caused a commotion in the surroundings. The expressions of the two disciples in charge of records changed and they hurriedly stood up."Greetings, Martial Uncle!"Xu Qing was about to walk past them. However, when his gaze swept past the female disciple from the corner of his eyes, he stopped in his tracks and sized her up.This woman had a beautiful appearance and her long hair was tied into a ponytail. Only her figure was slightly skinny. When Xu Qing's gaze swept over, she tensed up and her heartbeat sped up. She lowered her head even more."Your cultivation isn't bad and you're not far from the sixth level. However, the Forbidden Sea aura in your Sea Transformation Art is lesser than the disciples of the Seventh Peak of the same realm. You have to deepen the aura of the Forbidden Sea for a smooth breakthrough."Xu Qing gave some pointers and left after the woman thanked him with a trembling voice.The reason why he gave pointers was because Xu Qing remembered who this woman was.Back then, when he first came to the Seven Blood Eyes, he had encountered these two disciples.At that time, this woman had kindly reminded him of the dangers of the sect.Although it was a small matter, Xu Qing felt that since he encountered them again, he could pay her back by giving some pointers. After he left, these two disciples' backs were drenched with sweat.In the eyes of these two Qi Condensation disciples, the pressure Xu Qing's cultivation base naturally emitted and the baleful aura he had gotten from the battlefield made him look like a demon."This senior's cultivation... is extremely strong!!"The male disciple among the two took a deep breath. The fan in his hand was about to break.After saying that, he looked at the woman beside him and couldn't help but speak with a strange expression."Do you know that senior?"The woman's expression was a little dazed. She quickly turned around and ran to the side to check the information record of the teleportation array. After reading it, her eyes suddenly widened."Xu Qing!""Xu Qing?!" The man's entire body trembled."Is it that Xu Qing who has been famous recently and destroyed the Sea Corpse Race's holy item, causing the Sea Corpse Race to be furious and issue a bounty on him?"The woman nodded blankly."How does he know you!"The man's eyes revealed unprecedented envy."My memory is better than yours. I remember that a year ago, a scavenger youth came with a white token. Back then, when I reminded him of the dangers of the sect, I glanced at his identity token. That youth's name was also Xu Qing."The woman said softly, her eyes filled with uncertainty.The man at the side gasped again and was stunned as he recalled carefully."You said that he wouldn't live for more than three months."The woman glanced at her companion.The man's face instantly turned pale and his breathing became hurried. At the same time, he suddenly realized that this Seventh Peak's junior sister's actions in the past - that he had thought to be stupid - actually contained such an opportunity.Xu Qing didn't know that his casual action had sparked a discussion between these two disciples.At that moment, he was walking in the city in a gray Daoist robe. He headed straight for Port 176's Transportation Department.His magic ship was destroyed and he had nowhere to rest. Unless he returned to the Seventh Peak's cave abode, he could only find a place to stay for a few days.The Homicide Department was his first choice but Xu Qing decided to look for Zhang San to refine the magic ship before he went to the Homicide Department.He hadn't returned for half a year. Xu Qing, who was walking in the Seven Blood Eyes' main city, looked at the crowd bustling around in the surroundings and the familiar shops and stalls. He felt a rare calmness.As the battlefield was far away, the atmosphere of war in the Seven Blood Eyes wasn't that obvious. It didn't look much different from usual.Only many of the ports were requisitioned by the sect as a transportation station for strategic goods.After all, the expenditure when using the teleportation array to transport materials would be huge.Although the merchant ships were slow, they were still acceptable in a war that would last for a long time."Senior Brother Zhang San made the right bet."Xu Qing was very happy when he thought of the benefits he would gain in the future.However, he was still vigilant. After all, the thing the captain had done had incited too much greed."Fortunately, the captain has more bounty on him. If those people attack, they should attack him first... Moreover, he cares about his reputation. I think he's happy to see this happen, so it's not good for me to reveal the truth to him."Xu Qing seriously thought about it and nodded in deep agreement. His heart also felt slightly more at ease as he looked forward to the captain's return.Not long later, Xu Qing arrived at Port 176.Most of this port had been requisitioned by the sect. On the surface of the sea, there were cargo ships filled with strategic resources waiting to be dispatched. Xu Qing's gaze swept over and he sighed with emotion.Port 176 was clearly much more developed than half a year ago. The streets were orderly and there were many shops opening for business.Compared to before, the crowd was dozens of times larger.Moreover, because the three ports had been joined, the area was very large, so the number and types of shops were more abundant.Xu Qing walked fast. While looking at the prosperous scene, he arrived at Port 176's Transportation Department.He didn't enter immediately. Instead, he took out a jade slip and transmitted his voice to Zhang San.At the next instant, a figure rushed out from the Transportation Department. It was Zhang San."Xu..."Zhang San's excited voice rang out.However, he knew his limits. After he blurted out one word, he quickly swallowed the other word.In the blink of an eye, he arrived before Xu Qing. His eyes were filled with excitement as he pulled Xu Qing into a warehouse in the Transportation Department.The moment they entered, Zhang San spoke excitedly."You and the captain have become famous this time!!""The captain did it." Xu Qing immediately corrected him."The two of you are too crazy. You actually went to the Sea Corpse Race and destroyed the nose of their holy item. I heard that the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue's nose cannot be restored!"Zhang San spoke excitedly."The captain did it!" Xu Qing hurriedly said."This matter is too wild. I heard that the Sea Corpse Race has exploded from anger on the frontline. In fact, the higher-ups of the Sea Corpse Race even tried to talk to the ancestor and the others, wanting to get the nose pieces back, but the ancestor directly rejected them.""The captain is too crazy. I was also implicated. You know that this was all done by the captain." Xu Qing sighed.At this moment, Zhang San's emotions had calmed down a lot. He looked at Xu Qing and his eyes lit up as he hurriedly asked in a low voice."Xu Qing, is that nose piece still with you? Let me take a look.""Yes, but after leaving the Sea Corpse Race, it became an ordinary stone. There's nothing strange about it."Xu Qing felt some regret. He took out the nose piece and placed it to the side.This nose piece was over a hundred feet long and completely gray. Although it didn't emit any aura, it carried a sense of desolation.This was especially so for the countless beehive-like holes on it, which seemed to reveal the passage of time."Place it gently!"Zhang San hurriedly exclaimed and moved around the nose piece rapidly. As he touched it, the light in his eyes became even more intense. Finally, he looked at Xu Qing."Xu Qing, who said that this nose piece doesn't have any effect? This is a part of the ancestral corpse statue of the Sea Corpse Race. It's the thing the entire Sea Corpse Race desires to take back the most because this is their dignity."Zhang San was beaming with joy."I have a plan. I will build a huge museum in our port. After that, I'll embed the nose you and the captain obtained together and place it inside.""With this museum, let me tell you, Xu Qing, our port will be completely invincible!""We don't even need to hire people to guard it. The sect will help us do it. They will also promote our port greatly. Our port will definitely become famous. Countless people will come to visit and it's only a matter of time before we become the number one port of the Seven Blood Eyes.""The shops and streets near the nose of this Sea Corpse Race's holy item will become even more valuable. We will make a killing!!"As Xu Qing listened, a strange glint appeared in his eyes. He looked at the excited Zhang San and admired his sense of business.Hence, after some thought, he agreed with Zhang San.After discussing this matter, Xu Qing hesitated for a moment before speaking softly. T̺͆h̺͆i̺͆s̺͆ c̺͆h̺͆a̺͆p̺͆t̺͆e̺͆r̺͆ u̺͆p̺͆l̺͆o̺͆a̺͆d̺͆ f̺͆i̺͆r̺͆s̺͆t̺͆ a̺͆t̺͆ n̺͆o̺͆v̺͆e̺͆l̺͆-̺͆b̺͆i̺͆n̺͆.̺͆c̺͆o̺͆m̺͆ "Senior Brother Zhang San, my magic ship..."Zhang San gently touched the nose piece with satisfaction.After hearing Xu Qing's words, he lifted his head and smiled, as though he knew this would happen."Take it out. I long guessed that the magic ship would definitely be damaged when you returned this time. Now that our port is financially strong, I'll repair any damage for you.""Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang San. It's best if you can refine it a little faster. Thank you!"When Xu Qing heard this, he cupped his fists at Zhang San and turned to leave."Hmm? Where's the magic ship? Give it to me. How am I supposed to repair it if you don't give it to me?"Zhang San was stunned for a moment and looked at Xu Qing in surprise."Destroyed." Xu Qing looked at Zhang San.The warehouse fell silent.Zhang San looked at Xu Qing and his eyes slowly widened."Destroyed?"Xu Qing nodded seriously."Destroyed."

Chapter 275 Returned In Half
Zhang San fell silent. After a long time, he smiled bitterly and shook his head."Destroyed in the Sea Corpse Race?""It was shattered by a Golden Core," Xu Qing answered truthfully.Zhang San looked at Xu Qing's calm expression and felt that his previous judgment was wrong. This guy in front of him was as crazy as the captain.He was only at the Foundation Building realm but he actually provoked a Golden Core and got his magic ship destroyed.This kind of thing wasn't something that could be encountered by just any Foundation Building cultivators. Moreover, he had returned alive."Where's the captain?"Zhang San couldn't help but ask. He felt that since Xu Qing was like this, the captain shouldn't be much better.When he thought about how these two were people who had done such a huge thing in the Sea Corpse Race, it seemed reasonable for the magic ship to be gone."Captain…"Xu Qing recalled the auras of the three Golden Cores that appeared in the sky when he teleported away and fell silent."Forget it. When I refine the magic ship for you, I'll also make a coffin for the captain. If I can't use it this time, it might be of use next time."Zhang San sighed.Xu Qing nodded and bade farewell.After watching Xu Qing leave, Zhang San shook his head and walked into the workshop. He thought to himself that since he was forging a coffin, he should forge two."These two brothers are both mad. I will prepare one for each. It's fair and reasonable."Night had fallen outside. Xu Qing walked on the streets and looked at the harbor, listening to the sound of the waves. The familiar feeling made his heart relax a lot."Now, I have to lie low in the sect!"Xu Qing fell silent for a moment before entering Port 176's Homicide Department.As the deputy director of the Homicide Department, Xu Qing's arrival caused all the members in the department to be nervous, especially since the Homicide Department, which was established in Port 176, was the headquarters of the Black Division.As the deputy director, Xu Qing was in charge of the Black Division.Hence, his appearance caused all the disciples in the Homicide Department to be respectful. There were even Qi Condensation disciples from the Homicide Department guarding Xu Qing's residence, waiting to be summoned at any time.The mute was among them.After Xu Qing entered the house, the mute had quickly arrived and squatted outside the gate, looking at everyone fiercely.To him, regardless of whether they were from the Homicide Department or not, as long as anyone got too close, they would be his enemy.Xu Qing clearly sensed the commotion outside and also sensed the mute."His cultivation is improving quite fast." In Xu Qing's eyes, the spirit sea in the mute's body outside the house had already reached 700 feet. This meant that he had already stepped into the seventh level of the Sea Transformation Art.Although Xu Qing paid attention to it, he didn't have any thoughts of probing. Everyone had their own secrets, and he didn't care about the matters of others.Just like that, half a month slowly passed.Xu Qing's return was low-key, but the news still gradually spread. However, he was in the Homicide Department and had a ferocious reputation. Although he received visiting appointments one after another, very few people took the initiative to disturb him.Other than Huang Yan, Ding Xue, and a few others.During this half a month, many things happened on the battlefield. The war between the Seven Blood Eyes and the Sea Corpse Race had reached a new climax.Since a week ago, both sides had launched a large-scale battle.The Seven Blood Eyes divided into seven groups and launched an all-out attack on the seven secondary islands outside the Sea Corpse Race, wanting to break through them.The Sea Corpse Race did their best to stop them, but the Seven Blood Eyes' forces were divided into feint and real. Four groups were just feigning attacks. Their strategic goal wasn't to capture but to restrain.The remaining three groups were the true forces. Their goal was to occupy the secondary islands and use them as a springboard for the Seven Blood Eyes army to directly threaten the Sea Corpse Race's territory.This battle was extremely fierce.Although Xu Qing didn't see it with his own eyes, the dossier of the Homicide Department on this battle described it very clearly. In the end, the Seven Blood Eyes successfully took down two sub-islands.This immediately put the Sea Corpse Race in an extreme disadvantage.In fact, the higher-leveled cultivators also attacked many times. The war had already escalated on a large scale.The rewards given by the Seven Blood Eyes also increased again, causing a large number of Seven Blood Eyes disciples' eyes to enter the battlefield with greedy eyes.The popularity of the bounty on the captain and Xu Qing had originally decreased slightly because of this battle. However, very soon, an additional bounty appeared, causing Xu Qing's popularity to surpass the captain's in an instant.This additional bounty came from Dao Child Miao Chen of the Sea Corpse Race!"Additional bounty on Xu Qing. I promise to do ten things for the one who kills Xu Qing. Anything within my ability! And for those who give accurate clues, I also promise to do one thing for them!!"As a Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race, Miao Chen's combat strength was extraordinary and his reputation was extremely great. In fact, many nonhuman races had heard of him. Hence, his additional bounty immediately became a hot topic.With so much attention placed on this, the battle between Xu Qing and Miao Chen inevitably spread. This wasn't what Miao Chen wanted but he had no choice. To him, as long as Xu Qing was killed, everything else was secondary.Hence, he first added a bounty, causing Xu Qing to attract more malicious gazes wherever he was. After that, he sent another message."Xu Qing, do you dare to come to the battlefield and fight me? It will be just between you and me, and no one else will interfere!"Xu Qing naturally saw these two messages but he ignored them. He felt that this Dao Child Miao Chen was stupid.Regardless of whether it was his attitude toward life in the slums or the experience in the Seven Blood Eyes, Xu Qing wasn't interested in such a duel.He preferred to ambush and slit the neck of the enemy. It was clean and efficient.During this half a month, many things happened at the sect. The most significant event… was the construction of a huge museum in Port 176.Although this matter was hidden at the start, it was too significant and couldn't be hidden at all.Moreover, Zhang San no longer hid anything. Instead, he added fuel to the fire. Very soon, all the cultivators at the sect knew that there was only one item in the museum at Port 176.That was… the nose piece of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue of the Sea Corpse Race!This nose piece would be open for exhibition when the museum opened.Anyone could come and take a look.As soon as this news was leaked, the Seven Blood Eyes was shaken. Even the Sea Corpse Race heard about it and went crazy with anger. There was nothing that made them feel more humiliated than this.The Seven Blood Eyes' ancestor naturally heard of this and was quite happy with it. In fact, he even wrote a few words and got someone to teleport back to the sect from the battlefield to hang in the museum.There were only three words in this calligraphy."Light the Nose." Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Xu Qing received Zhang San's voice transmission and arrived at the museum that was about to be completed. When he saw the huge nose piece and the words hanging above it, he was stunned.Zhang San also had a solemn expression."What does the ancestor's words mean?" Xu Qing looked at Zhang San."Uhh… is he telling us to burn it with fire? Make it look like it is being burned?" Zhang San muttered in uncertainty.Just as Xu Qing was about to speak, he suddenly sensed something and looked outside the museum. It was empty."What's wrong?" Zhang San was stunned.Xu Qing stared there and narrowed his eyes. At the next instant, he suddenly lifted his right hand and a dagger appeared in it. He ruthlessly slashed to the side and the sound of tearing rang out, accompanied by a surprised voice."Eh!"As the sound appeared, the whistling sound of wind rang out from behind Xu Qing. Xu Qing's expressionless body instantly erupted with two balls of life fire, forming a heat wave that churned in all directions. At the same time, he turned around and punched.A rumbling sound rang out as Xu Qing took a few steps back. He looked at the empty space not far away. There seemed to be a figure amidst the distortion of the void there and he was also sent a few steps back."Chen Erniu." Xu Qing looked at the distorted area and slowly spoke. "Call me director!" An exasperated voice came out from there, but the captain's figure didn't appear. Zhang San also recognized the captain's voice and looked in the direction of the distortion in surprise."Captain, you're back!""Of course, there wasn't much danger this time. It was just dozens of Golden Cores chasing after me, but I managed to escape effortlessly. I even went to the battlefield of the Sea Corpse Race and returned from there."The captain's voice rang out from the void. After that, an apple appeared in the air and was bitten."Why are you still invisible?" Zhang San was curious.In the void that Xu Qing and Zhang San couldn't see, a figure stood there. This person only had one leg and one arm left. His waist was almost broken and there were countless wounds on his body. Several of them even pierced through his body.His face was bruised and swollen like it was disfigured. His hair was also charred. He was the captain.He endured the intense pain in his entire body and tried his best to open his swollen eyes, and spoke proudly."Its become a habit. I think the invisibility state is not bad. It's convenient for me to do many things. Also, as your superior, this state can highlight my identity."As he spoke, he deliberately held the apple and opened his swollen mouth with all his might. He calmly continued to eat and spoke casually."Those dozen or so Golden Core cultivators were toyed around by me. I even had the time to take a look at the First Ancestral Corpse Statue and pee there. Unfortunately, that thing is too big and I can't move it. Otherwise, I planned to move it back and let you guys pee at it.""Moreover, the reason why I'm like this is to take care of Deputy Director Xu. I can enter and exit the Sea Corpse Race with my eyes closed, but Deputy Director Xu can't. In order to cover for him, I even went to the Sea Corpse Race's palace to take a look.""If it wasn't for the fact that I came back in a hurry to find you guys, I planned to take a look at the place where the Sea Corpse Race's ancestor is recuperating and see if I could get anything from him."As the captain spoke proudly, his expression twisted from the pain. His injuries seemed to be similar to when he snatched Binding's flesh, but in reality, his body was about to break into pieces.Clearly, it wasn't easy for him to escape alive this time around. However, as a superior, his dignity didn't allow him to admit it. After he finished speaking, he glanced at Xu Qing and spoke again."Deputy Director Xu, I've helped you so much this time. Remember to return the 50,000 spirit stones you owe me."Xu Qing silently listened to the captain's words. He lowered his head and looked at the ground. Outsiders couldn't see the shadow that only he could sense.At that moment, the shadow was in the shape of a human with a leg and an arm. Its entire body was trembling as it ate an apple.

Chapter 276 The Sorrow Of The Weak
"Captain, since the bounty is 100 million, one leg and one arm should be 30 million spirit stones, right?"Xu Qing retracted his gaze from the shadow and looked at the apple not far away.A bite mark appeared on the apple that was floating in the air. It seemed that the person who bit it had paused."Deputy Xu, what leg? I don't understand, but the 20,000 spirit stones you owe me can't be less. After all, this time, I risked my life to cover for you!"Xu Qing nodded and tossed a jade slip.This was a recording of the captain coughing tenderly and showing off when he transformed into the third princess…A few breaths later, laughter rang out."My dearest Junior Brother, I was just joking with you. Eh, Zhang San, why are you here too? What is being built here? Why is there a nose?"Zhang San had a strange expression. The largest item here was that nose piece. He thought to himself, 'Captain, your way of changing the topic is too random.'He looked at the place where the apple was being eaten bite by bite and shook his head."Captain, do you still have the nose piece of the statue? Take it out. I'll put them together for the exhibition."Just as Zhang San finished speaking, a large gray stone landed loudly in the empty space at the side. It was 70 to 80 feet long and was none other than the nose piece that the captain had taken away.However, there were many bite marks at the corners, as though someone had bitten it many times before."This thing is useless. I tried to bite it a few times on the way back but it was completely ineffective," the captain said lazily.Zhang San didn't care. He stepped forward and carried the nose piece, placing it together with Xu Qing's piece. His expression revealed excitement and his eyes gleamed."Alright, I just returned and still have some official matters to deal with. I've been preparing a big plan recently. Now that I have a high-level corpse heart, I'm only lacking some information. When I'm done, the three of us will do something big!" The captain's voice echoed with excitement."Again?" Zhang San took a deep breath and looked at the apple as though he was looking at a god.Xu Qing's eyes narrowed as he asked."Can open magic apertures?""It's not just opening the magic apertures. Deputy Director Xu, your ambition is too small. If we succeed in this job, we'll reach the heavens in a single step. I prepared Binding's flesh and the high-level corpse heart for this big plan." The captain became more and more excited as he spoke, but some of his wounds opened, causing him to grimace in pain."I'll tell you in detail later. I'll leave first. Sigh, I am so busy, there are so many official matters for me to deal with." Enduring the intense pain, the captain calmly spoke and skipped away.Zhang San couldn't see, but Xu Qing was looking at the shadow. At that moment, the shadow was hopping away unstably."With these two nose pieces, our museum will be famous!" Zhang San didn't pay attention to the captain. At that moment, all his energy was on the museum. After circling the nose pieces, he became excited again.Xu Qing silently retracted his gaze and looked at Zhang San."Senior Brother Zhang San, is my magic ship ready?""I'm done refining it. The instructions are inside. Take a look for yourself first. I'm going to piece these two nose pieces together and try to make them more perfect."Zhang San threw a small bottle to Xu Qing before observing the nose pieces and thinking about how to repair them.Xu Qing took the small bottle and bade farewell.He didn't return to the Homicide Department. Instead, he went to the shore of Port 176 and released the magic ship.As the rumbling echoed and the waves rose and fell, a huge ship appeared in front of him.The shape of this ship was exactly the same as before.However, it was obvious that the materials were better. With the income from Port 176, Zhang San had invested a lot in this magic ship.In fact, Xu Qing could even faintly sense a fluctuation that suppressed the ignition of life fires on the magic ship. This reminded him of what Zhang San had said. Once the magic ship reached level eight, it would possess the might to suppress Mystic Brilliance Form.Xu Qing looked at the magic ship and took out the jade slip that Zhang San had given him.Although this time around, the magic ship no longer had Binding's flesh and the divinity couldn't continue to spread, the quality of the magic ship's materials was quite good.All the components inside were made of high-level materials. This level eight magic ship's price had already reached an extremely astonishing level."Xu Qing, magic ships are different from magic boats. Because magic boats are simple, every increase in level can increase their might by a lot. However, magic ships are different.""Although there's a gap between the first seven levels of the magic ship, it's not very big. Only when it reaches the level eight will its strength advance by leaps and bounds. I mainly focused on defense of your level eight magic ship. I used the heart of the boulder beast as the core and it's also used to augment the defense. The defense can be comparable to the early-stage Foundation Building Mystic Brilliance Form.""However, the divinity is gone, but I still have left a spot for it. If you can obtain the heart of a divine creature, it can instantly advance your magic ship to level nine.""At that time, regardless of defense or other aspects, it would be comparable to the mid-stage Foundation Building realm!""The greater the origin of the divine heart you obtain in the future, the greater the might of your magic ship. Once it reaches level 10, it'll be comparable to a late-stage Foundation Building cultivator. There are very few level 10 magic ships in the entire sect!" Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ "Also, I have added the disguise explosion technology like last time in your magic ship. At the same time, I've specially developed a new direction for you and added self-destruction. This might be more convenient for you and I'll also have a sense of participation. When your magic boat explodes later, you'll know how I participated…"As he looked at Zhang San's jade slip, Xu Qing stared at the magic ship in front of him.Although the magic ship no longer had the divinity attack, Xu Qing still walked on it in satisfaction. After activating the protective barrier, he walked to the cabin. The moment he sat down, he felt very comfortable."I'm still used to being on the ship. However, what was the sense of participation in the self-destruction Zhang San mentioned?" Xu Qing was a little curious but he didn't care too much. After taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and silently meditated.Three days passed in the blink of an eye.As the captain returned, the matter of Xu Qing and the captain's magnificent feat caused another commotion in the sect. Xu Qing was also looking forward to what the reward the sect mentioned would be.At the same time, he heaved a sigh of relief.Before the captain returned, Xu Qing felt very unsafe. If there were really any higher-ups in the sect who had ill intentions, he would face a huge crisis.Although this possibility was very small now, he still had to maintain vigilance.However… Xu Qing was relieved that the captain was back."After all, he's the main culprit. The nose was blown up by him, and the bounty on his head is even more exaggerated. Moreover, he's ranked first. If someone really wants to make a move, they will definitely choose him."Xu Qing's heart was calm but on the dusk of the third day, a person whose heart wasn't calm at all arrived at Port 176 with sorrow in his heart. He arrived outside Xu Qing's magic ship.This was a woman. She wasn't tall and looked very skinny. She wore a gray Daoist robe and her Qi Condensation cultivation was only at the third level.Such a person often had to be careful in everything they did in the Seven Blood Eyes, regardless of gender.This person was none other than Xu Xiaohui, who had entered the Seven Blood Eyes with Xu Qing back then.She silently stood beside Xu Qing's magic ship with a bitter expression. Her heart was filled with sorrow and trepidation. In reality, if she had a choice, she wouldn't have dared to look for Xu Qing.Although they were in the same batch, they didn't have much interaction after all, especially since Xu Qing had already become a Foundation Building cultivator and was now famous in the entire Seven Blood Eyes.She couldn't compare to such an influential figure no matter how hard she tried.She suffered for several months before she finally braced herself and arrived. At that moment, as soon as she got close to Xu Qing's magic ship, she immediately knelt down."Disciple Xu Xiaohui requests to see Martial Uncle Xu Qing."In the magic ship, Xu Qing, who was meditating, opened his eyes and looked outside. His gaze passed through the barrier and landed on Xu Xiaohui outside."What's the matter?"His voice rang out from the magic ship and echoed in Xu Xiaohui's ears. Xu Xiaohui's body trembled as she spoke softly."Martial Uncle, Senior Brother Zhou Qingpeng… died tragically in the sect three months ago."It was silent on the ship.A few breaths later, Xu Qing walked out of the cabin and stood on the ship. He looked at Xu Xiaohui, who was kneeling on the ground. The scene of the four of them going up the mountain together and the matter of Zhou Qingpeng generously giving him the Ghost Desires appeared in his mind.In reality, he wasn't very familiar with Zhou Qingpeng but the other party's gift back then could be considered a favor. Moreover, the Ghost Desires had helped him a lot. Now that he heard Zhou Qingpeng had died tragically, he sighed inwardly.However, he wasn't too surprised.The cruel environment at the foot of the Seven Blood Eyes' mountains wouldn't soften because of the war. There would always be people who died and there would always be people who yearned to join the sect.However, since he owed him a favor, Xu Qing had to ask about this. He looked at Xu Xiaohui and slowly spoke."Tell me in detail."Xu Qing's words caused Xu Xu Xiaohui to tear up.During these few months, she had fallen into despair many times, now she saw hope from Xu Qing's question."Martial Uncle Xu, Senior Brother Zhou originally followed Martial Uncle Ding Xiaohai in the Coast Guard Department. He told me that he had helped Martial Uncle Ding do many things that couldn't be known by outsiders. Martial Uncle Ding also promised him that he would give him a follower spot in the future."However, after Martial Uncle Ding advanced, he left the Coast Guard Department without Senior Brother Zhou. Senior Brother Zhou instantly lost his backer. Moreover, many of the things he did previously attracted the malice of many people. This is one of the reasons why he died.""Secondly, back then, Senior Brother Zhou gained a lot in the Seventh Peak's Grand Competition. These gains of his could have been protected. However, as Martial Uncle Ding Xiaohai ignored him, Senior Brother Zhou was targeted by others. One day three months ago, he died tragically on the streets.""I've been investigating until now but I still haven't found who the murderer is."Xu Xiaohui's tears flowed. Although her face was filled with sorrow, her words were very organized. Clearly, she had been preparing these words for a long time."You and Zhou Qingpeng?" Xu Qing fell silent for a moment before looking at Xu Xiaohui."Senior Brother Zhou has done me a great favor. Previously, in order to obtain the magic boat, I borrowed a large sum of spirit stones but I couldn't pay it back. I had no choice but to give up my dignity to curry favor with some disciples of the sect and become their plaything. In front of others, I look glorious but in reality, I live like an animal. I have to cater to all kinds of torture from them and my body is covered in scars. This is me being cheap and too vain."Xu Xiaohui bit her lower lip and spoke softly."Senior Brother Zhou pitied me and helped me repay the debt. I originally thought that he had taken a fancy to me, but in the end, he didn't touch me at all. Instead, he helped me many times. I, Xu Xiaohui, have a cheap life, but I still know that I have to repay a debt of gratitude.""However, my ability is limited. In the past few months, even though I sacrificed my body to investigate, there was still no result, so I could only come here and beg Martial Uncle Xu." Xu Xiaohui lowered her head and her forehead touched the ground.A gentle force spread out, stopping her from kowtowing."There's no need for that. I once owed Zhou Qingpeng a favor. I'll investigate this matter."

Chapter 277 The Secret Of Erniu
Xu Qing's words were the best thing Xu Xiaohui had heard in the past few months. She wasn't lying. Everything she said to Xu Qing was true.What she didn't mention was the heartache and pain she had suffered in the past few months to investigate. She now had no belonging to the Seven Blood Eyes.However, she didn't hate anyone. She just didn't understand why such a good person like Senior Brother Zhou would suddenly die a tragic death. She just wanted to do her best to repay the other party's kindness.Occasionally, she would wonder if it was worth it for her to have done so much to investigate… However, Xu Xiaohui felt that if she gave up, then perhaps she would give up the last trace of warmth in her heart.This warmth was her most precious thing since she came to the Seven Blood Eyes, so she didn't want to give up.Hence, even though Xu Qing spread out his strength to help her up, she still chose to kneel down after her strength dissipated. It was as though to fragile people, kneeling to others would help them have a peace of mind.Xu Qing sighed inwardly.He took out the voice transmission jade slip and contacted someone."Come and see me."Not long later, a small and skinny figure sped through the alley in the distance. He ran as fast as he could and headed straight for Xu Qing.Xu Xiaohui sensed it and her eyes narrowed when she turned her head.She saw a kid. He wore a gray Daoist robe and a dog skin coat, making him have a bulging appearance, but the coldness in his eyes and the murderous aura he emitted were enough to make the hearts of many people shake.Xu Xiaohui took a deep breath. She had heard of this person who liked to wear a leather coat under his Daoist robe.She knew that the other party was a mute. In the past half a year, he had gained a lot of reputation. He was someone who rose after Xu Qing in the Homicide Department and liked to kill messily.Many wanted criminals had been killed by him. Moreover, this person looked to be only at the seventh level of Qi Condensation, but in reality, some ninth level Qi Condensation cultivators from small sects had also died tragically at his hands. This was because this mute was even more reckless than those desperadoes. It was as though life was nothing to him. Once he confirmed that it was an enemy, it would be either he died or the enemy.Hence, when she saw the mute arrive, Xu Xiaohui instinctively felt some fear.The mute didn't even glance at Xu Xiaohui and knelt down in front of Xu Qing. The fanaticism and joy on his face were very obvious."Go and investigate the cause of Zhou Qingpeng's death. As for the details, you can ask her through the message transmission jade slip." Xu Qing pointed at Xu Xiaohui.The mute nodded vigorously and turned to leave. He didn't ask Xu Xiaohui any questions at all.It was as though in his opinion, if he settled this matter after asking others, it would show that he was useless.Xu Qing glanced at the mute's back and didn't speak. He stood there and waited silently.Dusk was passing. The sunset in the distant horizon was dyed pitch-black by the night and the moon rose.Xu Qing had chosen a specific place for his ship's berth. Regardless of whether it was day or night, it was very quiet and no one came to disturb him.The mute didn't make Xu Qing wait for long. The entire process only lasted for the time it takes for two incense sticks to burn. The mute returned and knelt before respectfully handing Xu Qing a jade slip.Xu Xiaohui had paid a huge price to find the answer after months of investigation. To the mute, it only required two incense sticks of time. Of course, this was also related to the Homicide Department.Amidst Xu Xiaohui's excitement, Xu Qing took the jade slip and checked it.The investigation into the cause and effect of Zhou Qingpeng's death was extremely detailed. Xu Qing wasn't interested in these. He only glanced at it and looked at the murderer's information.The murderer wasn't a disciple of the Seventh Peak.The person's name was Li Zelin. He was a piedmont disciple of the First Peak. His cultivation level was at the ninth level of Qi Condensation. He had a gloomy temperament and was murderous.The mute's jade slip indicated that the deaths of at least 11 disciples from the other peaks were directly related to this person.However, this person was cautious and killed in other areas. Moreover, the targets he chose were calculated, so he didn't cause irresolvable trouble.After all, such a thing often happened in the dark of the Seven Blood Eyes. As long as it wasn't out of line and no experts pursued the matter, the various departments wouldn't care.For example, if Zhou Qingpeng didn't owe Xu Qing that favor, his death would have gone unresolved.The mute's investigation was very detailed. Other than these, he even found Li Zelin's current location and his recent connections."He was taken in as a follower by the First Peak's Wu Jianwu. At this moment, Wu Jianwu is in Knowing Dreams Restaurant. I couldn't find out who he arranged to meet but this Li Zelin is guarding outside the Knowing Dreams Restaurant."Xu Qing nodded and passed the jade slip to the very nervous Xu Xiaohui.Xu Xiaohui took it and took a closer look. Her breathing was clearly hurried, and her face was pale by the time she finished reading the report. She looked at Xu Qing with a bitter and hesitant expression."Martial Uncle Xu, about this…"The contents of the jade slip allowed her to know about the murderer. At the same time, she also knew that the murderer had a very powerful background. She wasn't sure if Xu Qing would continue to help."Let's go." Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever. The mute led the way at the side. Xu Xiaohui was stunned. She looked at Xu Qing's back view and took a deep breath as she followed behind while suppressing the excitement in her heart.Knowing Dreams Restaurant was one of the most famous restaurants in the entire port area. It was very large and had a lot of customers. Compared to the restaurants of the Coast Guard Department, Knowing Dreams Restaurant was clearly of a higher level.This was because they mainly served spirit food. If one ate it on a daily basis, not only would it strengthen their body, but it also had the effect of removing anomalous substances. Although the effect was very small, it could be consumed for a long time.At that moment, on the second floor of the Knowing Dreams Restaurant, there were three people sitting in a luxurious private room.If Xu Qing was here, he would know all three of them.One was the First Peak's Wu Jianwu. Sitting opposite him was the pale-faced captain. At that moment, the captain was no longer invisible, and looking at him, he had no body parts missing.His injuries had also healed.The last person was an old man. This old man was none other than the innkeeper of the Inn on the Panquan Road.To be precise, there were not only three people here but also a snake.That snake was very large. It coiled around the beam of the private room and hung down halfway. It swayed around on its own, as though it was playing with itself in boredom.Occasionally, it would stick out its tongue at the captain or make gurgling sounds, seemingly asking something.The captain smiled and looked up at the large snake."Ling'er, are you thinking of someone?""Gurgle, gurgle!""How about this? Give me ten bottles of the anomalous substances fog you collected last time. I'll help you call that kid out and let him accompany you for a day. How about that? It's fair and reasonable."The captain spoke with a harmless expression.The large snake's eyes instantly lit up. The old man from the inn hurriedly stopped it."Chen Erniu, you're being too much. It's fine if you lie to me, but why are you lying to a kid now!!"Wu Jianwu, who was sitting at the side, coldly glanced at the captain. He picked up the alcohol flask and took a big gulp before calmly speaking."The human heart is greedy; one day, it will be cut down!"The captain blinked and took out an apple from his pocket. He slowly took a bite and gave Wu Jianwu a spurious smile."Little Jianjian, although you just came out of seclusion today and don't know what happened outside or how powerful I am now, I still have to tell you. If I were Uncle-Master, I would definitely beat you up until you speak human language."Wu Jianwu raised his sword-like brows."Making indescribable faces; be struck by lightning and split into two!""You don't have to flatter me. I promised Uncle-Master not to beat up his disciples anymore. Don't worry, I won't beat you up," the captain said with a smile.When the old man from the inn heard this, he slapped his forehead and looked helplessly at the captain and Wu Jianwu."Alright, alright. I invited you guys here today for three reasons. I will leave after I'm done speaking, it's annoying to deal with you guys…" The old man from the inn sighed."Firstly, Wu Jianwu, the time your master promised me is almost up. However, I have to leave the Seven Blood Eyes for some time, so I'll reinforce the seal of the inn before I leave. Tell your master to quickly send someone to take over. Otherwise, if anything happens, it will have nothing to do with me.""Secondly, Chen Erniu, I can still reinforce your seal three times. After three times, I won't be able to do it anymore. So, you have to think of other ways to suppress it as soon as possible. The stronger the divinity, the better. Otherwise… if it lives, you might not be you anymore." The old man looked at the captain meaningfully.The captain's expression was as usual. He was still smiling as though he didn't care at all.However, if Xu Qing was here, with his familiarity with the captain, he would be able to tell that after the captain heard the old man's words, he turned the apple in his hand but didn't eat it."The third thing is about what I said earlier. I have to leave for a period of time. Ling'er is about to reach the Foundation Building realm. She's a little special. I'm going to take her to the ancestral land. I'm afraid it will take a few years before we return.""Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle!" The large snake stopped swaying and anxiously spoke to the old man.The old man glared."You're still thinking about that kid surnamed Xu. Aren't you afraid that he'll eat you up?""Gurgle!!" The large snake also glared and didn't retreat at all.Seeing the snake like this, the old man let out a long sigh. The wrinkles on his face seemed to have increased."I think that kid Xu Qing isn't bad either. He's a good match for Ling'er." The captain coughed and showed encouragement to Ling'er.Ling'er was instantly happy and quickly swayed back and forth. She even spat out a small bottle filled with anomalous substances and gave it to the captain.The captain took it and kept it in his pocket. A smile bloomed on his face."They're very compatible. Also, I think Xu Qing can completely be our Ling'er's boy toy.""Gurgle?" Ling'er was curious, as though she was asking what a boy toy was.The captain was about to explain when Wu Jianwu, who was at the side, heard them mention the name Xu Qing. His eyes straightened and his body, which had been lazily leaning against the wall earlier, instantly tensed up. Her expression also revealed a solemn expression."Who in the world has a true image; looking back, it is the same person?"The captain and the old man looked at each other."I don't understand.""I don't know what you're saying." Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Seeing this, Wu Jianwu became anxious. His breathing hastened and he gritted his teeth fiercely."Is the Xu Qing you're talking about the Xu Qing from the Seventh Peak who just advanced to Foundation Building some time ago? The one who looks very demonic? Is he the same person?" Wu Jianwu quickly asked."That's right. Xu Qing is my deputy director. Do you know him?" The captain once again gave a smile that was not a smile."Incognizant in countless years, heaven…" Wu Jianwu snorted and was about to speak when the captain said faintly."It's fine if you don't know him. He's back too. I'll call him over to meet you or I'll bring you to meet him."Wu Jianwu's eyes widened. He took a deep breath and stood up."How can I go with a great pill in home, we'll meet again if fate allows it."With that, he turned to leave. However, the instant he turned around, an astonishing pressure suddenly erupted from the street outside the private room.This sudden fluctuation caused Wu Jianwu's expression to change. As for Ling'er, her eyes lit up. She pushed open the window and looked out.

Chapter 278 Best Actor
The night sky was dark and deep. The moonlight was cold, and there was a light rain.The bright moon hung high in the deep night sky like a silver plate. The cold moonlight fused into the drizzle, illuminating the port of the Seven Blood Eyes and flowing on the eaves outside the Knowing Dreams Restaurant.The raindrops formed a line and the rain lines formed a curtain.The moonlight couldn't dodge in time, casting a blurry shadow.It was like a painting of the night with moonlight and light rain.On the street that was covered in rain, a figure in a gray Daoist robe was walking over step by step while holding a white oil-paper umbrella.The face of the person under the umbrella couldn't be seen, but his slender body, tall and straight figure, and the aura he emitted when he walked over caused the rain to automatically turn into fog when it got close and brush past him.It gushed into the ripples formed by the soles of his shoes.On one side of the figure under the umbrella, in the darkness of the eaves on the street, there were two other people. One held an umbrella, while the other ignored the rain and quickly followed.The person who came was Xu Qing.Under the eaves were the mute and Xu Xiaohui.Although it was nighttime now, to this bustling street, it was as though all the joy had just begun. The restaurants on both sides of the streets were filled with noises. Dishes were being served and cups exchanged, laughter rang out, sounds of welcome and soft rejections could be heard from everywhere.Some luxurious stores even had many disciples with extraordinary auras guarding there like guards. Most of them were followers of important figures who were chatting and laughing in these stores.The target Xu Qing was looking for was among them.It was a skinny youth. He stood under the eave of the Knowing Dreams Restaurant and was originally chatting and laughing with a female disciple beside him. However, at the next instant, his expression suddenly changed and he turned to look at the streets.Not only him, but all the stores on this street also fell silent at this moment.Xu Qing didn't deliberately emit the power of his cultivation base. However, the murderous aura on his body and the energy fluctuations formed by his 65 magic apertures still caused everyone who sensed it to be shocked.A large number of gazes stared at him from different angles.Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever as he walked step by step to the Knowing Dreams Restaurant.A window on the second floor was pushed open and a large snake poked its head out and gurgled happily at Xu Qing. Xu Qing moved the umbrella away and looked at the large snake.He smiled slightly.Under the moonlight and the rain, the youth's smile for a moment caused the large snake's cries to pause.It was as though its body had become even softer. It instinctively wanted to crawl out and get closer but it was grabbed by the old man from Panquan Road who was behind her. He glared at Xu Qing with a vigilant expression.Xu Qing retracted his gaze and looked at the skinny youth who was trembling outside the Knowing Dreams Restaurant.The youth's mind was shaking intensely. His breathing was hurried and he couldn't control his body from trembling. His eyes stung even more. The figure he saw was like a god, distorting the surrounding void.It was as though the other party was a huge vortex that could instantly devour everything.Fear and horror crazily surfaced in the youth's entire body. As his body trembled, every part in his body screamed at him, telling him that he was in extreme danger.This was because not only did he see Xu Qing, but he also saw Xu Xiaohui, who had followed Xu Qing here!He had seen Xu Xiaohui before. After killing that small fry, Zhou Qingpeng, three months ago, he sensed that someone was investigating this matter. Hence, he secretly looked into it and discovered Xu Xiaohui, who was at a loss and helpless, searching for clues like an injured deer.He originally didn't care about such a fragile person who could be killed with a single slap. However, seeing Xu Xiaohui's weak appearance under such circumstances, he became interested. Hence, he pretended to help. After playing with her for a period of time, he got tired of her and didn't care anymore.However, at this moment, his heart trembled.He knew Xu Qing and knew that the other party's reputation was now illustrious and incomparable. Before he killed Zhou Qingpeng, he also knew that Xu Qing and Zhou Qingpeng were in the same batch but only in the same batch.In the Seven Blood Eyes, being in the same batch wasn't important. The competition was the same as raising Gu, so how could there be friendship?Even now, he felt that all of this wasn't real. He even felt that it might not be what he thought. Hence, when Xu Qing walked over, he suppressed his trembling and lowered his head to greet him."G-Greetings... Martial Uncle Xu.""Is it him?" Xu Qing's gaze landed on the mute and Xu Xiaohui.The mute nodded respectfully. Xu Xiaohui gritted her teeth and glared at the youth. The moment she read the jade slip earlier, she had realized that she had been too stupid. She nodded fiercely.Seeing this, the mind of the skinny youth standing outside the Dream Recognition Building completely sank. He instinctively took a few steps back and spoke quickly."Master, save me..."Almost as soon as his voice came out, it stopped abruptly. A black iron stick appeared out of thin air beside Xu Qing and instantly pierced through his neck.The power of lightning contained in it spread throughout his body through the puncture, causing the youth's soul to instantly dissipate. His body dried up and cracked.The lightning attracted the lightning in the clouds in the sky. In the blink of an eye, a bolt of heavenly lightning rumbled over from the sky and descended rapidly like a silver snake, landing on the skinny youth who had already become a corpse.The dry and cracked corpse turned into pieces of black dried meat that emitted smoke and scattered on the ground before being extinguished by the rain.This scene was too shocking, causing waves to surge in the minds of everyone who saw it.None of them doubted that Foundation Building cultivators could kill Qi Condensation cultivators so cleanly and efficiently, but Xu Qing's attack was too astonishing. He actually lured the heavenly lightning. This was the reason why the minds of those who saw it shook.The black iron stick instantly returned and quietly floated behind Xu Qing, melting into his shadow.The more this was the case, the more the minds of those who saw it trembled.The surroundings fell silent. Just as Xu Qing was about to leave, a surprised voice rang out from the second floor of the Knowing Dreams Restaurant."Aiya, Little Jianjian, the one who died was the follower you brought. He was asking you for help just now."This voice belonged to the captain.When Xu Qing saw the large snake and the old man from Panquan Road earlier, he had noticed two other auras in the private room. He was extremely familiar with one and wasn't unfamiliar with the other.Xu Qing looked at the window of the private room.In the private room, the First Peak's heaven's chosen, Wu Jianwu, glanced at the captain who had a spurious smile on his face. After a few breaths of silence, he snorted coldly and flicked his sleeve as he suddenly stood up. A ball of life fire fluctuations erupted from his body. His aura was like a rainbow, causing the surroundings to tremble."Wow~" The captain hurriedly cooperated and shouted.Wu Jianwu felt that this person was a fool, and it would be too embarrassing for him to argue with a fool. Hence, he didn't even glance at the captain and walked toward the window with a gloomy expression.​ After reaching the window, the power emitted by his cultivation base fluctuated violently. Amidst the lightning and thunder in the sky, large bronze swords actually appeared from the clouds and locked onto this place.It was as though monstrous anger was brewing in Wu Jianwu's body and could erupt at any moment. An astonishing killing intent spread out from his body and finally fused into his eyes as he looked at Xu Qing."Why did you kill my follower!!"He said this very proudly.Coupled with the dignity emitted by his body and the gloomy expression on his face, he gave off the feeling of a heaven's chosen.As he spoke, thunder rumbled in the sky and exploded in all directions. The bronze swords that formed emitted endless sharpness.This scene caused the minds of everyone in the surrounding shops to shake.They quickly started leaving. They had a strong premonition that... a huge battle would probably happen here.After all, Xu Qing had killed the follower in front of the master. This matter was like slapping his face.Moreover, the First Peak's cultivators cared a lot about their reputation and would definitely not let the matter rest.The eyes of the large snake in the private room revealed a ferocious glint as it locked onto Wu Jianwu. It looked like it wanted to whip him but was held back by the old man.The old man was overjoyed. He thought to himself, 'Xu Qing, oh Xu Qing, let's see what you do next. The First Peak is the most protective of their own. The eight senior brothers of Wu Jianwu love to fight in groups.'At the same time, the minds of the mute and Xu Xiaohui shook.The mute lifted his head. Even though his body was trembling under Wu Jianwu's pressure, he still revealed his sharp teeth and stared fixedly at the other party's neck.As for Xu Xiaohui, she bit her lower lip and felt extremely anxious. She felt that she had implicated Xu Qing.However... amidst the changes in everyone's emotions, only Xu Qing's expression was as calm as ever.He looked at Wu Jianwu, who was standing beside the window. His gaze was cold and he didn't say a word. As he lifted his right hand, the black iron stick buzzed and rose from the shadow behind him.At this moment, a long laugh came out from Wu Jianwu.He threw his head back and laughed loudly, nodding as he laughed. He even let out a voice of agreement. Moreover, his voice was very loud, as though he wanted everyone to hear him."I see. What you said makes sense. Since this matter is your private feud, I really shouldn't participate." Best n0vel 0nline free at ⓝ(0ⓥ)ⓔⓛⓑⓘⓝ Xu Qing frowned but didn't speak."There's no need for wine, I understand this matter." Wu Jianwu laughed loudly."Haha, Brother Xu, you don't have to be like this. I really don't have time in the near future. Forget it, forget it. I also admire your magnificent feat in the Sea Corpse Race. Alright, since you treat me like this, I'm not a petty person. I'll pay the 100,000 spirit stones fine for killing this person!"Ling'er's eyes widened. She looked at Wu Jianwu and then at the empty surroundings, not understanding what he was talking about."Yes, yes. Alright, let's meet again when we have time later. I'll take my leave first. I am glad to have met Brother Xu today."Wu Jianwu spoke loudly and heartily. From the dignity at the start, he gradually became joyful. Finally, a smile appeared on his face and he cupped his fists toward Xu Qing.Xu Qing's expression was strange. From the start to the end, he didn't say a word.Wu Jianwu quickly swept his gaze across Xu Qing's expression and his heart trembled. He hurriedly flicked his sleeve and maintained his laughter as he stepped out of the private room.He flew toward the distant horizon against the lightning and rain.His figure was like an immortal, like a beautiful painting that revealed an astonishing realm."I have transcended the mundane world, and became an immortal by swallowing the sea of clouds."As he moved forward, all the ancient bronze swords in the sky accompanied him in the surroundings. His voice also echoed in all directions as he walked further and further away.
