"You, my Dao Protector, will also need to suffer more injuries!"As he spoke, he wanted to stab Xu Qing but Xu Qing retreated."Princess, your cultivation is only at the Perfected Qi Condensation Realm and your recovery speed is very slow. I'll protect you. Under the state of being chased all the way, your injuries are getting more and more serious and you can't heal yourself.""As a Foundation Building cultivator, my recovery speed is extremely good, so I don't need more injuries. That would be too fake."The captain was stunned for a moment.Taking advantage of the captain's stunned state, Xu Qing went up and slashed again and again. In the end, the captain clutched his stomach and dodged, glaring at Xu Qing. However, facing Xu Qing's serious expression, he sighed."The princess and the Dao Protector are being chased, but it's impossible for us to not have time to rest, especially when we're about to reach the Sea Corpse Race's territory. The pursuers have some reservations, so they didn't chase after us."Xu Qing thought about it and replied."Yes, but the closer we got to the clan's territory, the more serious the princess' old injuries became. She was on the verge of death, so she was sent to the forbidden area to recuperate immediately."The captain had a bitter expression on his face as he looked at his injuries and then at Xu Qing. Under Xu Qing's serious expression, he let out a long sigh and closed his eyes.Xu Qing felt comfortable in his heart. He went over and stabbed the captain five more times, causing the captain to look extremely seriously injured and weak. Only then did he end this 'pursuit'.Time slowly passed just like that. Very soon, three days passed. The black wooden ship they were on finally approached the Sea Corpse Race's territory.When the island continent of the Sea Corpse Race appeared in his sight, Xu Qing's expression turned solemn.He took a deep breath and checked his body. After confirming that there was nothing wrong, he was still worried, so he made the shadow emit the aura of the Sea Corpse Race.This way, Xu Qing was basically no different from the Sea Corpse Race.In fact, with Golden Crow Refines All Life, he himself could emit some of the Sea Corpse Race's innate corpse poison. Under this concealment, his disguise could be said to be perfect.Although the captain didn't have these methods, he had clearly prepared for this for a long time. Hence, Xu Qing didn't worry about his exposure."I've finally escaped‚Ä¶ I have returned home‚Ä¶"The captain was clutching his stomach and leaning against the railing weakly. The wind blew over and fluttered her blood-stained black hair, revealing that delicate and moving beautiful face under his beautiful hair.His pale skin and the complex look in his eyes made the captain no different from the real third princess. He even seemed to have grasped the third princess' thought process. If it wasn't for the fact that Xu Qing had witnessed the captain's disguise and was familiar with it, it would be very difficult for him to recognize the captain right now."Thank you for protecting me."The captain's body was on the verge of collapse and his voice was weak with a hint of gentleness.His hand that was holding onto the railing at the side was trembling. He was suppressing the seriousness of the injuries in his body with all his might, as though the slightest relaxation would cause all his injuries to act up and exterminate his life.There was an almost fatal wound on his chest that would have pierced through his heart had it deviated even a little bit. Even so, it still seemed to have injured his heart meridian. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  As for Xu Qing, his originally white Daoist robe was now dyed with blue blood. His pale appearance became even paler.His breathing was unstable, as though he was forcefully enduring his wounds. His most serious injury was on his neck, as though his windpipe had been slit before.Although he had recovered a little, he couldn't speak much. In fact, blood could even be seen seeping out from the edges of his robe.Facing the captain's words, Xu Qing was expressionless, as though he didn't have many emotions. He ignored his injuries and cupped his fists and bowed to the captain.At that moment, a powerful fluctuation swept over from ahead, instantly enveloping their ship.The ship they were on paused in the air.This powerful fluctuation wasn't emitted by a cultivator but by the power of the array formation!It was the protective array of the Sea Corpse Race's territory.Now that it was war time, the Sea Corpse Race's array formation was activated permanently. While stopping all outsiders from entering, it could also allow speed up the arrangements of the Sea Corpse Race in their territories.Xu Qing knew this identification by the array formation was their first test in infiltrating the Sea Corpse Race's territory.However, Xu Qing and the captain were already prepared for this. As the array formation's power spread out, the captain's body emitted an energy fluctuation in response. It was the same for Xu Qing. He opened the small bottle and similarly, energy fluctuations spread out.The array formation quickly swept past them and acknowledged their identities.This scene made Xu Qing have a high opinion of the captain's preparations.He looked at the Sea Corpse Race's island continent below.This vast island that was like a continent had a completely different style from anything he had seen before.This place was the coastal area, and it was filled with huge vegetation that looked like lingzhi.However, they were black in color and emitted dense corpse poison along with astonishing pressure.Each of these black lingzhi was over a thousand feet long.At first glance, there were about a hundred of them in the coastal waters, spreading along the coastline.On each lingzhi, there were many berths built from bones.One could see a large number of coffin-like warships waiting to take off.Countless tentacles grew under these lingzhi, drooping on the ground and in the sea.

Chapter 262 Sea Corpse Strange News (4)
They were absorbing anomalous substances, and also spread ropes that connected to the boats floating on the sea.This place was clearly a port, and the entire coastline of the Sea Corpse Race seemed to be a port as well.The sky here was enveloped by thick dark clouds.There were teleportation arrays shining inside. Cultivators were teleporting out and returning at all times.Numerous battleships of the Sea Corpse Race and the figures of sea corpse cultivators filled the entire island.The sound of explosions and sonic booms could be heard frequently, but people's words were rare.The land was also black and was covered in huge lingzhi like the ones in the coastline. However, the color was a little different. Most of the lingzhi on the shore were red.Giant trees were common on this island.Those trees were rotting, emitting dense anomalous substances. Countless black butterflies moved between them.There were long rivers that were as red as blood.The entire world was like the land of the netherworld. While it was a shocking sight, there was also an indescribable terrifying pressure that spread in all directions.When Xu Qing and the captain's black wooden ship was frozen in the air above the sea, coffins immediately soared into the sky from the coastline below.They instantly got close to the ship and stood in the surroundings.A total of 16 old coffins surrounded the black wooden ship, seemingly in a formation.Streaks of black lightning spread out from them and connected with each other.Following that, a coffin in front of Xu Qing and the captain suddenly trembled. The lid opened and a sea corpse whose entire body was covered in black fog walked out.The appearance of this sea corpse was a little blurry due to the fog. One could only vaguely see their human appearance.After he walked out, his sharp gaze instantly landed on Xu Qing and the captain.The power fluctuations of a late-stage Foundation Building cultivator was being emitted by this sea corpse. He had not activated Mystic Brilliance Form, but the pressure formed by 90 magic apertures made Xu Qing's heart sink.This person was clearly the cultivator in charge of the port below. He had appeared because of Xu Qing and the captain.Xu Qing lowered his head and followed the etiquette of the Sea Corpse Race he had learned on the way to show his respect. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  This sea corpse cultivator swept his gaze across Xu Qing and the captain, before speaking to the captain in a deep voice."Greetings, Third Princess." "Where's my father?" The captain held the railing and asked coldly."The king is on the battlefield and hasn't returned.""So, you see me but don't kneel? Also, what's the meaning of this blockade!"The captain suddenly took out a black pearl and threw it at the sea corpse cultivator.The black pearl directly exploded on the sea corpse's body.The sea corpse cultivator's body shook but he wasn't injured at all. He expressionlessly glanced at the captain and lowered his head to kneel on one knee.This attack clearly strained the captain's injuries. He spat out a mouthful of blood but forcefully endured the pain."Escort me to the ancestral corpse statue land. I want to heal my injuries!""Before the king left, he instructed that if the princess returned, she should be directly sent to the palace and not allowed to go out."Faced with the third princess' request, the three fires Foundation Building cultivator calmly replied. He then waved his right hand; immediately, all the coffins in the surroundings emitted the aura of a cultivator.At the same time, the black lightning bolts also connected to the black wooden ship and guided it forward.This scene wasn't out of Xu Qing and the captain's expectations, and their plan included solutions for it.The captain spat out a mouthful of blood. His feeble state and near death signs were clearly revealed. He looked at the three fires sea corpse cultivator and suddenly smiled sweetly."Alright, it's fine if I die in the palace. This way, after I revive, I'll have a reason to devour you and everyone in your team. It will be fun. Hurry up."The captain, who was disguised as the third princess, had a sweet smile on his face that was very beautiful and innocent.However, the meaning behind his words was incomparably sinister.It was as though there was deep hidden resentment and madness slowly spreading out, causing the late-stage sea corpse Foundation Building cultivator to stop in his tracks.He knew the third princess' personality and understood that she was courting death by going out many times. He also knew that every time the third princess revived, the king would arrange for some of his people to be devoured by the third princess to speed up the revival process.He fell silent for a moment before looking at Xu Qing."You can scram now."Xu Qing's expression was cold and the corpse poison in his body spread out, forming an invisible storm in the surroundings. His voice was hoarse as he spoke."Trying to snatch my credit?"Almost at the instant Xu Qing finished speaking, a black coffin behind him suddenly opened and a sea corpse cultivator rushed out. The fluctuations of two balls of life fire erupted and their speed was so fast that they instantly neared Xu Qing.This female sea corpse was a merfolk when she was alive.The instant she got close to Xu Qing, she immediately tried to suppress him. Clearly, the late-stage Foundation Building sea corpse cultivator wanted to snatch Xu Qing's credit for escorting the princess back.Xu Qing's gaze was cold. The instant the merfolk woman got close, he slammed his body back and collided with her.

Chapter 263 Sea Corpse Strange News (5)
Immediately after the collision, Xu Qing grabbed at the merfolk woman.The expression of the merfolk woman changed. Her mind was shaken by Xu Qing's physical strength and the life fires in her body swayed. She immediately retreated.However, Xu Qing's speed was too fast. When he grabbed at her, a suction force seemed to spread out, causing the merfolk woman's movements to freeze.At the next instant, Xu Qing moved and arrived in front of the woman in the blink of an eye. His right hand pierced into her chest and grabbed her heart, squeezing it ruthlessly.Squelch! The heart of the merfolk sea corpse cultivator collapsed.Even though the Sea Corpse Race wasn't sensitive to pain, such injuries still made her let out a mournful cry. However, this female cultivator wasn't simple either. Her eyes were filled with ruthlessness as she bit at Xu Qing's neck.This was a commonly used method by the sea corpses.Her sharp teeth were about to touch Xu Qing, when Xu Qing sneered and smashed his head into the female cultivator's mouth.With a cracking sound, the woman's teeth collapsed and her face was badly mangled. An even more mournful cry rang out. Xu Qing's expression turned sinister as he also opened his mouth and bit down on the merfolk sea corpse's neck!This bite was extremely powerful, causing a portion of the merfolk sea corpse's neck to be instantly torn off.As he inhaled, dense anomalous substances crazily surged into Xu Qing's body from the merfolk sea corpse's body.The merfolk sea corpse wanted to struggle but Xu Qing had a tight grip on her. He held her down and continued to absorb her energy.The entire process only lasted for six to seven breaths of time before the female merfolk sea corpse's entire body was exhausted of anomalous substances. Her life fires were extinguished and her magic apertures dried up. Her entire person turned into a dried corpse and fell to the side. She wasn't dead and was still twitching."Ah, how fun. Why is this young lady deflated?"The captain smiled sweetly and walked unsteadily to the female merfolk sea corpse.Xu Qing turned and looked at the three fires Foundation Building sea corpse cultivator standing in the air. "Let me swallow another nine. I can give you the credit."There was still blue blood at the corner of Xu Qing's mouth. His gaze was cold and emotionless.However, his current appearance caused the expression of the three fires Foundation Building sea corpse to be a little solemn.The reason why he spoke like that earlier was not only to snatch the credit but also to probe.During this period of war, some disciples of the Seven Blood Eyes had used various methods to sneak in. Although they were all found out and killed, the princess' return might also be set up by the Seven Blood Eyes.If the other party had really left just now, he would have reported this matter and the other clansmen would naturally screen the person.However, now, he dispelled this thought. The array formation had confirmed the princess' identity. As for the clansman who escorted the princess back, not only had the array formation confirmed his identity, but the other party also devoured anomalous substances which was something only sea corpses dared to do.To be able to kill one of his two fires subordinates so easily, it meant that the other party wasn't far from breaking through to his level.He raised his hand and waved. The lightning on the 16 black coffins in the surroundings instantly dissipated and they fell down."Send the princess to the forbidden area of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue!"After removing the blockade, the late-stage Foundation Building cultivator Race spoke.Immediately, a lingzhi on the ground started twisting and emitting a large amount of black fog. After this black fog squirmed and gathered, it formed a huge octopus.This octopus floated over. One of its tentacles wrapped around the black wooden ship while the other tentacles extended into the distance on the ground, bringing Xu Qing and the captain straight into the distance.Behind them, the three fires sea corpse cultivator lowered his head and respectfully saw them off. At the same time, he let out a low voice."Princess, it's my duty. Please don't mind my disrespect just now."With that, the three fires sea corpse cultivator bit off one of his fingers and threw it forward.Immediately, the finger transformed into a dense corpse poison that spread to Xu Qing and the captain's ship, transforming into a mark that shone with black light."With this insignia, no one will disturb you on the way. Princess, please forgive me for my sins.""You can scram now," the captain lightly said."Thank you, Princess."The three fires Foundation Building cultivator thanked before leaving. He returned to the coastline and continued to guard against foreign enemies.Just like that, the ship Xu Qing and the captain were on was carried very quickly by the running octopus. It continued to approach the location of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  In reality, they had planned this as well.There were a total of nine ancestral corpse statues in the Sea Corpse Race. They were scattered in different areas and were heavily guarded. The location of the seventh ancestral corpse statue was relatively close to the sea and was somewhat far from the royal city, so it became the captain's first choice in his plan.Most importantly, according to the information bought by the captain, the Golden Core experts of the Sea Corpse Race who were guarding the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue were transferred to the battlefield because they were hard pressed in the front line.The one guarding it now only had the cultivation base of Perfected Foundation Building realm.Xu Qing was originally hesitant, but the captain guaranteed that there was nothing wrong with the information, so Xu Qing didn't question closely.As they moved forward and entered the inland, this world of the Sea Corpse Race was completely revealed to Xu Qing and the captain.The ground was pitch-black and covered in countless black grass. These grass contained astonishingly dense anomalous substances, causing this place to be no different from the forbidden zone Xu Qing had been to.

Chapter 264 Sea Corpse Strange News (6)
To the Sea Corpse Race, lands with such dense anomalous substances were naturally holy lands. However, to other cultivators who absorbed spirit energy, this place was equivalent to a poisonous land.Moreover, once they stayed here for too long and the anomalous substances in their bodies accumulated without control, the possibility of mutation would increase infinitely.However, the captain clearly had methods to ignore the poison of anomalous substances for a short period. Xu Qing didn't know why but he felt that there was a high chance that it had something to do with flesh with divinity. Best n0vel online free at n0ŒΩE‚ÑìnEX—Ç  Clearly, the episode on Binding Island couldn't be the captain's first act of madness. He should have done crazy things many times. Xu Qing also saw that other than the black grass, blood-colored lingzhi, and withered tall trees, there were also blood-colored rivers.Although the sky was pitch-black, it didn't affect one's vision. There were many eyes in the clouds and these eyes were all red. Every time they opened, light would spread to the ground.As they opened and closed at different times, this land covered by the black sky always had light. Although the lighting was dim, it was enough for cultivators to observe their surroundings.As for what these eyes were, Xu Qing soon knew the answer.He saw an eye crawling out of the clouds, revealing the body of a large rotting fish. This fish had a tentacle on its head and an eye at the end of the tentacle.It couldn't be seen when it was closed but when it was opened, it emitted a light like a lantern.These fish were densely packed in the clouds in the sky of the Sea Corpse Race. They would occasionally sink and fly through the air, causing light to continuously spread out.This scene made Xu Qing feel very strange. At the same time, he also saw many sea corpses. The members of this race were from all kinds of races, most of which Xu Qing had never seen before.As they moved forward, Xu Qing also saw a scene that caused his mind to shake.It was a piece of land.All the lingzhi and giant trees on the ground had been cleared. When the octopus passed by the land, Xu Qing saw a large number of sea corpses digging on the ground.The portions that had been dug out looked like a palm. However, this palm was too big, a few thousand feet in size. It looked like the burial ground of an ancient giant.As the ground was dug up and the rotting flesh were revealed, Xu Qing noticed that more sea corpses gathered there. They were casting spells and performing some kind of ritual.When the ship Xu Qing was on left that area, an earth-shattering roar rang out. Xu Qing's heart trembled as he turned his head and saw a huge hand that was ten thousand feet long stretching out from the ground, as though it wanted to grab at the sky."Revival!" Xu Qing drew in a deep breath.Other than that, there was a unique creature in the Sea Corpse Race. It was a butterfly with a ghost face.According to the captain's common knowledge classes, when Xu Qing saw these butterflies, he knew that these butterflies were called ghost dreams. It was rumored that these ghost dream butterflies were the true natives of this island continent.They were a race that had appeared here before the Sea Corpse Race. There were many of them on this island continent. As Xu Qing and the captain moved forward, ghost dream butterflies floated over and danced around them.This scene should have been a beautiful scene, but as the malevolent ghost faces on the butterflies' wings devoured the anomalous substances fiercely, the scene became sinister and strange.For some reason, many ghost dream butterflies gathered near Xu Qing. In fact, he could see even more of them coming toward him from afar.This caused Xu Qing to frown."My Dao Protector, why are you attracting bees and <anno data-annotation-id="0ea334dc-29d9-49af-ba02-0fb9eeb1e91f">butterflies</anno>?" Behind him, the captain coughed softly and spoke.<annotations style="display: none;"><ol class="tinymce-annotation-container"><li data-annotation-id="0ea334dc-29d9-49af-ba02-0fb9eeb1e91f">It means to attract the opposite sex/ flirt</li></ol></annotations>",

Chapter 265 In The Enemy‚Äôs Lair
Xu Qing glanced at the captain.He felt that the captain was too immersed in his role. If he wanted to speak, then speak properly. That soft cough that sounded like a moan made Xu Qing very uncomfortable.However, Xu Qing didn't say anything. This was because he knew that although the Diamond Sect's ancestor had been silent these few days and didn't appear, according to the other party's personality, he must have secretly recorded some scenes.These precious recordings should be useful in the future.As such, he cast a deep glance at the captain before turning his head and ignoring him.The captain raised his brows and was about to continue speaking when an energy fluctuation came from afar. The screening power of the array descended again and landed on the black wooden ship.The octopus trembled and crawled on the ground, allowing the array formation to sweep over. As for the ghost-faced butterflies, they quickly spread out. Xu Qing also looked down with a solemn expression. He saw a huge building in the distance.The design of this building was simple; there were two huge stone pillars that seemed to form a headless door. There was a black vortex inside that was rumbling and spinning, emitting red lightning that spread in all directions.Outside the door, there were many sea corpse cultivators sitting cross-legged on red lingzhi. There were men and women among them, some looked like humans and some had nonhuman bodies.At a rough glance, there were no less than a thousand of them and they guarded this place extremely tightly. Any existence who wanted to pass through this place and enter the vortex had to pass through them before.Moreover, there were clearly experts among them. A few gazes swept over, making Xu Qing feel danger.The power of the array formation spread out. As it swept through, the mark formed by the three fires Foundation Building cultivator on the black ship - Xu Qing and the captain were on - shone. After it resonated with the power of the array formation, the array formation fluctuations dissipated. Only then did the octopus get up again and carefully move forward. When it passed by many lingzhi, the sea corpse cultivators on them stood up and greeted the captain."Greetings, Third Princess.""Greetings, Third Princess."Xu Qing looked calm but he was vigilant inwardly. With so many people staring at him, if he wasn't careful and revealed a flaw, all his previous efforts would be in vain.At the same time, the gathering of the senses of the sea corpse cultivators here caused the pressure here to be extremely great. Xu Qing clearly felt that the material in the small bottle in his pocket was evaporating even faster. If this continued, it would probably lose its effect before long.Even the captain was nervous no matter how well disguised he was. He took out many black pearls and played with them in his hand, revealing an impatient expression.When they were about to reach the giant stone pillar gate, and more and more gazes from the surroundings landed on him, the captain suddenly threw a black bead to the side.Boom! The auras of all the sea corpse cultivators in the surroundings fluctuated."Have you seen enough?"The captain's expression changed from impatience to a sweet smile. Although his pale face revealed extreme weakness, it was this weakness that made his smile seem more charming.The surrounding sea corpse cultivators fell silent and immediately lowered their heads."Help me in." The captain smiled and walked to the front of the ship, raising his hand at Xu Qing.Xu Qing really admired the captain's acting skills. He lowered his head and walked over. He held the captain's small hand and took a step forward, leaving the black wooden ship and the octopus below. They then rapidly approached the huge black vortex.Compared to this vortex, Xu Qing and the captain were like ants.The terrifying power emitted by the vortex caused Xu Qing and the captain's minds to shake.However, the two of them had mentally prepared themselves. They still continued to move at a moderate pace. When they were right in front of it, they looked at each other and stepped into the vortex at the same time without any hesitation.As they walked in, their minds shook. It was as though they had entered another space and appeared in a red world!The area of this world wasn't large. The ground was covered in a red liquid that was like a blood pool. There was a circle of stone pillars in the surroundings, and there were more than 70 of them.On each of them sat a cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race!Other than that, the most eye-catching thing in this world was a huge statue. This statue stood above the pool and its feet were submerged in the water. It was over 30,000 feet tall and looked like it could touch the sky.Its entire body was red and covered in spots. It looked like a human corpse that was roaring at the sky. Its hands were also placed very strangely.Its one hand was raised as though it wanted to grab at the sky, while the other hand was placed flat on its chest.A large number of tentacles grew on the statue's body. These tentacles spread in all directions like streamers and opened eyes appeared on them. If one took a closer look at those eyes, they would see that they reflected worlds.Different worlds were reflected in those eyes, causing the aura of this statue to be earth-shattering. The pressure shook the surroundings and seemed to resonate with all the Sea Corpse Race members here.It was as though these sea corpses were all transformed from the aura of this statue. This statue itself was their source.At the same time, the pressure here clearly surpassed that of the outside world by at least tens of times, causing the small bottle on Xu Qing's body to continue to evaporate.A crack appeared on the captain's face, as though his disguise was about to shatter. However, it was unknown how he did it, but the crack quickly healed. However, Xu Qing could sense some unstable fluctuations from the captain's body.Clearly, he too couldn't hold on for too long here.The two of them were shaken.This statue was the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue of the Sea Corpse Race.The appearance and size of the nine ancestral corpse statues of the Sea Corpse Race were different. This seventh one wasn't the largest or the strongest among them. However, as one of the Nine Ancestors, his status in the Sea Corpse Race was supreme.Even the Sea Corpse King had to bow respectfully every time he arrived.This was because these nine statues contained the secret of the birth of the Sea Corpse Race. The red pool under the statue produced the liquid by itself. The liquid inside was a necessity for the Sea Corpse Race to transform new clansmen, and was also holy liquid for healing.At this moment, there were dozens of sea corpse cultivators sitting cross-legged and recuperating in the red pool.The weakest among these people was at the level of two fires. There was also one with three fires who was injured. Clearly, he had returned from the front line.What really caused Xu Qing and the captain's minds to shake intensely was that on the left hand of the statue which was placed on its chest, there was a boy in a red robe sitting cross-legged!Xu Qing had seen this kid before in the Pearl Islands.The other party was none other than the Golden Core cultivator of the Sea Corpse Race who had walked toward the Pearl Islands back then!Xu Qing looked at the captain.The captain was also shocked. He responded with a bitter smile.Clearly, his information was wrong. Perhaps the previous guardian had been transferred and a new guardian had arrived.Xu Qing fell silent. He felt that he was too crazy to believe the captain, and come here with him.Not only were there tens of two fires here, but there were also a thousand cultivators outside. Moreover, there was a Golden Core cultivator who could slap him to death at such a close distance.Although the other party was meditating, Xu Qing could imagine that if the other party opened his eyes and took a closer look at them, he might be able to infer something. After all, the pressure here was already removing their concealment effects.Not to mention that this was the Sea Corpse Race's territory. It was possible for even more experts to appear at a slight disturbance‚Ä¶Xu Qing drew in a deep breath and suppressed the nervousness in his heart, transforming it into determination. He gritted his teeth fiercely. Since he was here, he had to get some benefits no matter what.At the same time, he also noticed the madness in the captain's eyes. The two of them looked at each other and walked forward at the same time.The pool was about a thousand feet away from where they were. As they walked, rotting corpse hands rose from the ground.These hands didn't coil around them. Instead, they were like steps to put the feet on. Xu Qing and the captain slowly approached the pool. When they arrived, not many sea corpse cultivators on the surrounding pillars opened their eyes.Only a few opened their eyes and swept their gazes across Xu Qing and the captain. After noticing the third princess, they retracted their gazes one after another.As for the Golden Core boy, he also didn't open his eyes.This caused Xu Qing to heave a sigh of relief inwardly. He saw the captain quickly stepping into the pool and finding a place close to the statue's feet. After he sat cross-legged, he would occasionally shift his position, wanting to completely touch the statue.Xu Qing also stepped into the pool. The instant he entered, he sensed a strange power stored in the pool. It wasn't spirit energy or anomalous substances.  BEst novel online free at ’º0 ã…õ ü…Æ…®’º  It was more like a pure nourishment that also contained soul power, causing the magic apertures in Xu Qing's body to tremble faintly just by walking in. This immediately allowed Xu Qing to confirm that this pool was indeed of great help in opening the magic apertures.He quickly sat down and swept his gaze across the surrounding sea corpse cultivators who were recuperating. He then carefully tried to absorb that power.Xu Qing knew that he couldn't open his magic apertures here. Otherwise, the fluctuations emitted would be too obvious and he would be discovered in an instant. Hence, the best method was to store this power.He would store enough energy in his body and open his magic apertures when he got out.How many magic apertures he could open depended on how much he could store here.Determination appeared in Xu Qing's eyes as he circulated the cultivation base in his body. Immediately, traces of blood-colored energy flowed into his body from the pool and slowly gathered at his dantian.As soon as this red spirit liquid appeared in his dantian, it emitted a soul-stirring might, causing the magic apertures in Xu Qing's body that hadn't been opened to continue shaking.A strong desire rose in Xu Qing's heart.Xu Qing suppressed his breathing and carefully checked his surroundings before continuing to absorb. This feeling of stealing under the enemy's nose‚Ä¶It was very stimulating.

Chapter 266 Something Happened...
The place where the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue was located was very quiet.Usually, there were no intense energy fluctuations here, and the Sea Corpse Race didn't allow their clansmen to make a breakthrough near the statue.Hence, the silence here was like this all year round.Healing in there required qualifications. Unless one had a high status, only those who had made contributions to the race would be allowed to come to the blood pool under the statue to heal their injuries. This also caused there to be relatively few cultivators here.There were more people now because of the war. However, even so, the silence here was still as usual. No one dared to be disrespectful here.At the same time, there were few cases of outsiders infiltrating the Sea Corpse Race's holy land. After all, under layers of protection and with the screening of array formations, it was extremely difficult to break in.It wasn't that infiltration cases didn't exist. In the history of the Sea Corpse Race, such a thing had happened several times.In the past, the reason why people sneaked into this place wasn't to absorb the blood pool but for the ancestral statue itself.The nine ancestral statues of the Sea Corpse Race were made of special materials that were rarely seen in the world. It seemed that only these nine statues possessed them, so they attracted the curiosity and attention of many races.However, the material of these ancestral statues was extremely sturdy and even if a part of the statue was destroyed, it could quickly recover. In addition, not everyone could suppress the Sea Corpse Race, so the statues were preserved perfectly.Naturally, if the attacker's strength was astonishing, they could completely destroy the statue. However, most of those with powerful strength wouldn't infiltrate. They could rely on their strength to request the cooperation of the Sea Corpse Race.Moreover, once the material of these statues left the island of the Sea Corpse Race, they would turn into an ordinary item and lose their profundities.As time passed and after experiencing the exploration of the powerful races time and time again, these nine statues were finally ignored by others.Moreover, because the statues recovered on their own, they seemed to have never suffered any damage.There were rumors that the Sea Corpse Race originally had more than nine ancestral statues. It was just that the Sea Corpse Race could only preserve nine till now.However, no matter what, to the Sea Corpse Race, these statues were their holy items. Anyone who had designs on the holy items would be treated as their biggest enemy.Even if the infiltrators couldn't cause any damage to their holy items, it was still a humiliation in the eyes of the Sea Corpse Race.The most recent infiltration was a hundred years ago. At that time, the infiltrator was only at the Foundation Building realm. He used some unknown method to come here and absorb a large amount of spirit liquid before escaping alive.The Sea Corpse Race was furious and chased after the infiltrator for many years. However, that person was peerlessly talented. After escaping danger after danger, he was taken in as a son-in-law by a big shot. Only then did the Sea Corpse Race have no choice but to postpone this matter. However, they became even more vigilant after that. As for this Foundation Building cultivator back then, he had risen in the past hundred years and was... Old Master Seventh of the Seventh Peak of the Seven Blood Eyes.Today, the event that had happened in history was happening next to the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue.Xu Qing carefully absorbed the spirit liquid. The amount of blood-colored spirit liquid gathered in his body gradually increased and the aura it emitted that made his magic apertures covetous grew increasingly intense.However, the dangers in the surroundings and the Golden Core expert caused Xu Qing to be extremely careful."I can't be too greedy. Once my body is full, I'll leave this place." Xu Qing warned himself. Seeing that no one noticed him, his absorption speed became even faster.In addition, at this moment, the shadow silently entered the pool. After the hundred eyes blinked at the same time, it took a sip with some curiosity. After that, all its eyes narrowed as though it was very intoxicated and quickly absorbed the liquid.Seeing this, Xu Qing secretly took out the black iron stick and placed it in the pool. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was clearly shaken. After absorbing a little, his eyes also lit up."Both of you can absorb it? Is this spirit liquid effective for everyone?"Xu Qing was surprised. After some thought, he secretly used Golden Crow Refines All Life. Immediately, the totemic tattoo imprinted on his back shone slightly under Xu Qing's control. A large amount of red liquid flowed into it.This scene caused Xu Qing to be very surprised.The captain quickly noticed his absorption speed. His eyes turned red with envy.Xu Qing's absorption speed was clearly faster than his. This made the captain feel embarrassed. Hence, after looking around and discovering that no one was paying attention, he took out a small bottle and placed it in the water before knocking it fiercely.Immediately, a large amount of blood-colored spirit liquid flowed into the bottle.This bottle was mysterious and could accommodate a lot. However, it was quickly filled. After the captain calmly kept it, he took out another one and began to store the liquid again.Just like that, he used item after item to store the liquid. His speed wasn't any slower than Xu Qing's.Xu Qing also sensed this scene. He glanced at the captain with a frown. The captain also looked at him with a provocative gaze. novel online free at ÔΩéÔΩèÔΩñÔΩÖÔΩåÔΩÇÔΩâÔΩé  Xu Qing fell silent. He knew that his captain was a lunatic, so he wouldn't argue with a lunatic. At the same time, he continued to remind himself not to be greedy and just take enough. After he absorbed enough, and the shadow, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, or Golden Crow Refines All Life reached the limit, he would leave.However, the shadow, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, and himself hadn't absorbed enough yet. Xu Qing thought about it and slowly moved his body closer to the statue.He had already sensed that the closer he got to the statue, the better the quality of the blood-colored spirit liquid.As he moved closer to the statue, Xu Qing's heart was filled with surprise. He discovered that his absorption speed had increased even more. It was the same for his shadow. The Diamond Sect's ancestor was the most useless. He actually reached his limit soon after.Xu Qing glanced at the black iron stick unhappily. After he stored it, he thought inwardly.'Mm, I'll leave when the shadow and I are full!'After having this plan, Xu Qing continued to move slowly. Very soon, the time it took for an incense stick to burn passed and he silently arrived at the foot of the statue.At the same time, after the captain noticed Xu Qing's actions, he also moved toward the statue. Just like that, when Xu Qing arrived beside one of the statue's feet, the captain also arrived beside the statue's other foot.He felt that Xu Qing was a little too crazy. He had been sucking for so long but he still didn't leave.'No, I can't be compared by my subordinate. Hehe, are you trying to compete with me in madness?' The captain muttered in his mind. He directly took out ten bottles and began to store the liquid.Xu Qing's brows rose immediately.'The captain is too greedy. If this continues, we will be easily exposed. I can't stay here for too long. I just need enough. I can't be greedy!'Xu Qing mumbled inwardly and continued to absorb. After the time it took for half an incense stick to burn passed, he regretfully discovered that the blood-colored liquid in his body had been contained to the extreme and couldn't continue. Although his entire body looked normal, Xu Qing felt as though it was about to explode.At the same time, the shadow also sent emotions of satiety.Xu Qing sensed that his Golden Crow Refines All Life seemed to be able to accommodate more. Hence, he pressed his back against the statue.'I can't be greedy. Shadow, iron stick, and I are all full. Only the golden crow is left...' Xu Qing muttered inwardly and quietly circulated Golden Crow Refines All Life. His back was pressing against the statue, so with this circulation, the power from both the statue and the pool instantly surged over.Vaguely, some ripples appeared on the surrounding water. Xu Qing's heart pounded as he hurriedly suppressed the speed of his absorption before the ripples dissipated.His heart raced as he slowly absorbed it.The captain's eyes widened as he looked at Xu Qing before lowering his head to look at the bottles around him. He gritted his teeth fiercely and took out another ten bottles to accelerate the storage.Time slowly passed. After the time it took for an incense stick to burn out... Xu Qing's breathing suddenly became hurried. He felt that something was amiss.At that moment, he could sense that as he unleashed Golden Crow Refines All Life on the statue, other than a large amount of qi and blood power surging in, there was also a ball of undercurrents rapidly forming at the location he was pressed against the statue.This undercurrent existed in the statue's body. Outsiders couldn't see or sense it. Only when Xu Qing activated Golden Crow Refines All Life could he sense it. It gave him the feeling that he had gathered a large amount of impurities during the absorption .These impurities couldn't leave the statue and were blocked. Hence, they continued to gather and emitted fluctuations that caused Xu Qing's heart to skip a beat.This fluctuation was extremely unstable. It would explode with a little stimulation.Xu Qing was horrified, especially since he could faintly sense that the power contained in this undercurrent was extremely terrifying. He felt that once it exploded, he would definitely be enveloped by it at such a close distance.Xu Qing felt an intense life-and-death crisis.'Once this thing explodes, it will definitely cause other reactions in the statue... It's too dangerous.' Xu Qing immediately became vigilant. He slowly restrained Golden Crow Refines All Life and carefully ended the devouring without stimulating the undercurrent substance.He sensed that after the undercurrent lost its suction force, it slowly floated up along the interior of the statue and became even more unstable.Xu Qing lifted his head and glanced at the Golden Core boy sitting cross-legged. He silently stood up and didn't dare to move too quickly. He suppressed the nervousness in his heart and walked out.Xu Qing's actions caused the captain to be stunned. When he looked at Xu Qing, Xu Qing gave him a signal with his eyes.The captain was a little hesitant as he stood up with eyes revealing a hint of conflict and unwillingness. He felt that what he had done this time wasn't satisfying at all. Moreover, the degree of madness was far inferior to that old fellow.He felt that it would be fine if no one noticed that he had infiltrated and left successfully.However, if someone discovered his identity, this would clearly be a huge loss.'Since there's a high chance that I'll be discovered when I go out, of course I have to go big. When that old fellow finds out later, he'll have to admit that he's inferior!' After the captain thought about it, a hint of madness appeared in his eyes.When Xu Qing saw the madness in the captain's eyes, his heart skipped a beat. He knew that the situation wasn't good. Hence, he didn't hesitate and sped up.The captain, who was panting heavily, suddenly laughed. He reached into his storage bag and took out a piece of flesh that was filled with the aura of divinity. As soon as this piece of flesh, astonishing energy fluctuations spread in the surroundings.Almost at the instant this fluctuation spread out, the captain put the flesh into his mouth. After he swallowed it, his entire body rumbled and erupted with a piercing golden light, causing all the sea corpse cultivators here to be awakened.The life fires in the captain's body were fully activated. His aura rumbled as he removed his seal. His entire person shone with a golden light and he pounced on the foot of the statue. He didn't care about the surrounding sea corpse cultivators or the Golden Core expert. He opened his mouth and bit fiercely at the toe of the Ancestral Corpse Statue!Crack!

Chapter 267 Second Ball Of Life Fire Formed!
"Madness!!"When Xu Qing saw this scene, he drew in a deep breath as shock filled his expression.At that moment, he felt that the captain who had rushed toward Binding with bloodshot eyes was back.As the cracking sound echoed, the captain directly chewed off a small piece of the toe of the statue!There was a clear bite mark left on the toe.The material of this statue was special and it was very difficult to destroy. As for the captain, he had completely stimulated the divinity of the flesh of Binding in exchange for this bite.Before the statue could recover, the captain had already swallowed the small piece of stone in his mouth with reddened eyes.The surrounding sea corpse cultivators who were recuperating were all shocked by this sudden change and stood up one after another.The cultivators on the dozens of pillars also opened their eyes one after another and looked at the captain with intense emotions.At the same time, a terrifying Golden Core aura erupted from the palm on the ancestral corpse statue's chest.The Golden Core boy on it opened his eyes and looked down with a puzzled expression.He looked at Xu Qing.Xu Qing's body rumbled and his mind shook.The Golden Core boy then looked at the captain. The captain's body trembled and he quickly retreated.The boy didn't bother with the retreating captain. His gaze landed on the statue's foot.He saw the bite mark there and a small piece that was missing.Although the statue was rapidly recovering, the bite mark was still very clear."It's been a long time since an outsider barged in here. Interesting. How do the two of you want to die?"The Golden Core boy calmly spoke. Clearly, he didn't care much about such a small matter like two Foundation Building thieves. He just had to kill them. The pressure of his Golden Core spread out.Lightning rumbled and the surroundings trembled. It was as though there was a world-destroying power suppressing all living beings.However, just as he finished speaking and stood up, the expression of this seemingly calm Golden Core boy changed drastically. He abruptly turned his head to look at the statue at the side.An extremely unstable undercurrent was rapidly rising in the statue. It passed by the boy and surged toward the head of the statue. The instant the boy spoke, it arrived at the nose of the statue and gently knocked into the inner wall.An earth-shattering explosion that shook the entire forbidden area erupted from the nose of the statue!The forbidden area space trembled and even affected the outside world.Moreover, the explosive force was so great that it actually destroyed the nose of the statue instantly.It shattered into pieces and fell to the ground.The Golden Core boy was the closest. He bore the brunt of the impact and his entire body was blasted apart. Blood spurted out as he was sent tumbling back into the distant wall.Many Foundation Building cultivators of the Sea Corpse Race below were also affected and spat out blood. Their expressions were filled with horror and disbelief as they looked at the statue that had lost its nose.Following which, mad anger rose in the eyes of all the Sea Corpse Race members. The killing intent caused the weather in the entire forbidden area to change.A deafening roar rang out through the entire forbidden zone. It came from the mouth of the Golden Core boy who was blasted to the wall and was vomiting blood."What did you do!!!"His roar even suppressed the lightning rumbles, causing the place to buzz. All eyes were now focused on the captain.Killing intent surged into the sky!The bite the captain had taken earlier was just a small piece. However, the collapse of the statue's nose was completely different.Everyone knew about cause and effect.They had seen the person disguised as the third princess nibbling on the toe of the statue. After that, the nose of the statue exploded. This was clearly closely related!The captain was dumbfounded.At this moment, not to mention the Sea Corpse Race, even he felt that it was related to him. It should be that the bite he took caused some reaction, so the nose of the corpse ancestor statue exploded."But the distance is too far‚Ä¶"The captain's breathing was hurried. The instant the Golden Core roared angrily, Xu Qing didn't hesitate to keep a piece of the statue's nose that had landed beside him. He then turned and rushed out.Right now, there wasn't much attention on him. Most of the anger was targeted toward the captain.The Golden Core boy roared angrily as he headed straight for the captain. Although he didn't have the time to pay attention or cared about Xu Qing, he wouldn't let him off either."Go and kill the other one!"The captain's eyes widened as he put away a piece of nose beside him. His speed erupted explosively and the seals in his body were undone one after another. He instantly went from two fires to three fires, before actually reaching the level of four fires. There was also monstrous divinity spreading out from his body as he escaped.Although he was fast, the Golden Core boy's speed was even faster. He caught up to him in the blink of an eye. The captain spat out some blood and used some unknown secret art to escape again.The Golden Core boy's eyes were bloodshot and filled with madness. Such a vile incident had happened while he was guarding. This was extremely humiliating for him and his killing intent toward the captain had already reached the extreme.Such an incident had not occurred in the Sea Corpse Race for many years now. It would be fine if the person who came was an unstoppable expert, but the infiltrators were only Foundation Building cultivators.The Golden Core boy's emotions fluctuated much more intensely when he discovered that‚Ä¶ the toes of the Ancestral Corpse Statue had recovered but the nose hadn't."Impossible. It only shattered a bit more, so it is taking a while!" The Golden Core boy was shaken. To the Sea Corpse Race, whether it could recover or not was two completely different things.If it could recover, although this matter was bad, as long as he killed the invaders, this matter would be resolved.At most, they would be more vigilant in the future.However, if it couldn't recover‚Ä¶The Golden Core boy didn't dare to continue his thoughts. He felt that it was impossible. The ancestral corpse statues of the Sea Corpse Race had been damaged and blasted open by others in the past. However, the statues had recovered in a few breaths of time.Even the much heavier destruction was restored in about fifteen minutes."So, this is impossible!" The Golden Core boy took a deep breath and couldn't help but take another look. However, there was still no change to the nose of the statue. This caused the uneasiness in his mind to transform into madness as he chased after the captain.He was fully focused on capturing the captain. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to bear the terrifying consequences if the statue really couldn't recover from the damage.Due to the special material of the statue, if it really couldn't be recovered, this missing nose would never be fixed.In other words, no matter how many years it was in the future, as long as the members of the Sea Corpse Race used or saw this Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue, they would feel that naked humiliation over and over again!If the other party had the ability to truly destroy this statue, then‚Ä¶ it was equivalent to having the ability to erase the future of the entire Sea Corpse Race!The impact of this matter was so great that it even surpassed the war with the Seven Blood Eyes.This Golden Core boy went completely crazy.At that moment, Xu Qing's heart was pounding as he fled rapidly.Fortunately, the Golden Core boy's target wasn't him, so the sea corpse cultivators chasing after him were all Foundation Building cultivators. However, even so, it still caused Xu Qing to have no time to take a break. This was because there were more than 20 people who had activated their Mystic Brilliance Form to pursue him. Most of them were at the two fires level and there was even one at the three fires level!That three fires cultivator was an old man and he gave Xu Qing an extremely great pressure.The terrifying fluctuations coming from his body distorted his surroundings. Generally speaking, with three fires cultivation, he could catch up to a two fires cultivator in an instant. However, due to Xu Qing's physical strength and the activation of the life lantern, the three fires couldn't do so, but the distance between them was still rapidly closing at a speed visible to the naked eye.Once he was caught, Xu Qing knew very well that it would be difficult for him to deal with so many Foundation Building cultivators, especially since this wave would not be the end. The energy fluctuations here had already spread to the outside. There was no need to guess how furious the Sea Corpse Race would be.Even other Golden Core experts might appear.At the thought of such an outcome, Xu Qing's scalp went numb. This time, he was very clear that what he and the captain had done was a little too much.Moreover, he was in the forbidden area's space, so he couldn't use the disorder teleportation talisman. If he wanted to use it, he had to leave the forbidden area."I can only open my magic apertures!" Xu Qing's eyes were red. As he fled crazily, he knew that the only solution was to quickly open his magic apertures and form a second ball of life fire.Once the second ball of life fire was formed, coupled with his life lantern, it was equivalent to him possessing the power of three fires. In addition to the body refined by Golden Crow Refines All Life, Xu Qing was confident that he could suppress all three fires cultivators!He even felt that at that time, he should be able to break the concept that Foundation Building cultivators couldn't fight across realms. He would be able to cross realms to fight against four fires.With this thought in mind, Xu Qing mobilized the blood-colored spirit liquid that had filled his dantian and directed it toward his fiftieth magic aperture.Xu Qing's entire body trembled as the fiftieth magic aperture instantly opened!With more magic power, Xu Qing's speed was even faster. However, he didn't stop opening the magic apertures. In the next breath, Xu Qing's body rumbled like thunder, the sound of which spread to his surroundings, causing the hearts of the pursuers behind him to tremble.The magic power fluctuations continued to spread from Xu Qing as his magic apertures opened.The 51st, 52nd, and 53rd magic apertures were blasted open one after the other.This wasn't the end. The blood-colored spirit liquid Xu Qing absorbed was still surging violently. In the blink of an eye, his 54th magic aperture was opened, and so was his 55th magic aperture.One aperture opened in each breath!Seven breaths later, the 56th magic aperture in Xu Qing's body opened!At the eighth breath, his 57th magic aperture was opened. The magic power in his entire body rumbled and his life fire burned even more exuberantly. His aura even formed a storm, causing the expressions of the sea corpse cultivators behind him to change. Best novel online free at n0ŒΩE‚Ñìn—îX—Ç  The expression of the three fires sea corpse cultivator changed drastically and he shuddered as he looked at Xu Qing who was fleeing.Seeing that just the opening of the magic apertures of the fleeing cultivator formed such a terrifying pressure, he gritted his teeth and activated a secret art. His speed was boosted, causing everything in the surroundings to slow down in front of his eyes as he rapidly approached Xu Qing."Die!"At this critical moment, Xu Qing's eyes turned red. He couldn't care less and used his physical strength as support to erupt all the red spirit liquid in his body in an instant!"Open, open!!"Xu Qing's eyes revealed madness. In the blink of an eye, shocking explosions rang out in his body. The 58th magic aperture, 59th magic aperture, and 60th magic aperture were all opened!The spirit liquid continued to rampage until it opened his 65th magic aperture!"Life fire!" Xu Qing shouted with bloodshot eyes. Countless threads rose from the 31st to the 60th magic aperture and rapidly gathered in his body. As the flames on Xu Qing's body erupted, there was a whooshing sound.The second ball of life fire illuminated the Heavenly Palace!

Chapter 268 Divine Might Of The Two Fires
In Xu Qing's body, the 65 magic apertures transformed into 65 vortices that continued to spin while producing rumbling sounds!The appearance of the second ball of life fire was even more dazzling. It reflected the light of the first ball of life fire in his dantian, causing the light to reveal the Heavenly Palace more clearly.At the same time, the burning of the 65 magic apertures also provided Xu Qing with a terrifying power, causing the two balls of life fire to transform into a sea of fire. When it spread out, the air around Xu Qing distorted as an indescribably high temperature erupted around him.All of this caused Xu Qing to feel that it was a continent burning inside his body, not a volcano!Among the sea corpse cultivators chasing after him, a few of the two fires cultivators who were more heavily injured let out miserable cries the moment Xu Qing's second ball of life fire erupted.They were fully focused on Xu Qing earlier, so the light from the life fire burned their eyes directly. Blood trickled down their eyes.Even the recovered two fires cultivators felt their minds shake. The cultivation bases in their bodies fluctuated and their life fires showed signs of extinguishing under this crushing force.As for the three fires cultivator, waves of emotions were surging in his mind before turning into horror. He slowed down involuntarily.One ball of life fire was the early-stage Foundation Building realm, and two balls of life fire meant the mid-stage Foundation Building realm!At this moment, Xu Qing's cultivation base instantly stepped into a new stage as the second ball of life fire was formed, advancing to the mid-stage Foundation Building realm!Although it looked like a breakthrough of a small realm, in the world of the Wanggu Continent, the difference between the different realms of cultivation was like heaven and earth.It was fine in Qi Condensation. Once one reached Foundation Building, this difference was extremely obvious.A cultivator with the Mystic Brilliance Form could easily kill a cultivator without the Mystic Brilliance Form.It was the same between two fires and one fire.As for Xu Qing, because of the existence of the life lantern, his two fires' combat strength was no different from the late-stage Foundation Building with three fires. In addition, his emperor-level cultivation art, Golden Crow Refines All Life, allowed Xu Qing's improvement at this instant to be earth-shattering!At that moment, flames raged all over his body. As everything in the surroundings distorted, the pressure from his body spread in all directions.Most of the pursuers behind him stopped. The instant the three fires cultivator took a deep breath and wasn't willing to chase anymore, Xu Qing suddenly turned around with deep killing intent.His speed was so fast that he couldn't be seen by the two fires cultivators at all. The three fires cultivator felt his hair rising on their ends because even he could barely see Xu Qing's figure.However, as a late-stage Foundation Building cultivator, he had plenty of combat experience. At the critical moment, he bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blue blood as he decisively chose to burn his magic apertures!As a heaven chosen with some renown in the Sea Corpse Race, he had opened a total of 92 magic apertures. These 92 magic apertures erupted at the same time to stimulate his three flames to burn even more vigorously.However, his expression still changed drastically.This was because in this state, he could clearly see some of Xu Qing's movements and also saw that Xu Qing's target wasn't him but‚Ä¶ the sea corpse cultivators behind him.With strength comparable to three fires and physical body refined by Golden Crow Refines All Life, Xu Qing's speed had already reached the limit of what a Foundation Building cultivator could unleash. He directly appeared in front of an injured two fires sea corpse cultivator.He directly slammed into the latter.The body of the two fires sea corpse cultivator collapsed like a fragile paper. As flesh and brain matter splattered everywhere, Xu Qing had already arrived in front of another two fires sea corpse cultivator and rammed into him!After that, the third, fourth, fifth!He lifted his right hand, and a fire dagger appeared. When he moved past a two fires cultivator, the dagger had already slashed across the neck!The head flew up!Blood spurted out! The Diamond Sect's ancestor controlled the black iron stick and erupted with shocking lightning that headed straight for the other Foundation Building cultivators. There was also the shadow that had already spread out and formed a domain.A large number of eyes formed on the ground and a large amount of the anomalous substances in the bodies of the sea corpse cultivators in the range were lost.The entire process only lasted for seven to eight breaths of time, before half of the dozens of sea corpse cultivators either had their bodies explode or their heads flew up!The faces of the surviving Sea Corpse Race members revealed clear horror. They retreated without any hesitation.However, at the next instant, a cry rang out. The Golden Crow appeared behind Xu Qing and coldly looked around before flying out from Xu Qing's side. Its powerful tail flames transformed into iron chains that headed straight for everyone.Xu Qing attacked again. Although he hadn't rushed out of the forbidden area and could be in danger at any moment, since he made a move, he instinctively wanted to kill all of them. At that moment, he stomped fiercely on the ground.His powerful body shot forward at an even more terrifying speed as he rushed toward the three fires Foundation Building cultivator who was already retreating.The pupils of the three fires Foundation Building cultivator contracted and he knew that he couldn't dodge. Hence, his expression turned into one of malevolence and madness. He decided not to retreat anymore and waved his hands in front of him. Immediately, the 92 magic apertures in his body erupted again. In fact, he directly exploded two of his magic apertures!With the help of the power from the destruction of two magic apertures, his strength soared again. He charged fiercely toward Xu Qing.White bone hands stretched out crazily from the ground and the surrounding void, and rapidly coiled around Xu Qing.There were so many skeletal hands that they formed a small sea of bones. The three fires Foundation Building cultivator didn't stop as he spat out another mouthful of blue blood.As soon as the blood appeared, it transformed into a blue flying sword with astonishing baleful aura and monstrous might that caused the surroundings to shake. It immediately locked onto Xu Qing.The three fires Foundation Building cultivator performed another hand seals and slapped his chest; his body turned blurry and overlapping shadows appeared. They split into four identical bodies that headed straight for Xu Qing from four directions."Die!"Xu Qing let out a cold snort. With a wave of his hand, the flames in his body erupted again, creating a violent impact when they came into contact with the bone hands in the surroundings. At the same time, he lifted his right hand and ruthlessly slammed down.Immediately, the heavenly saber appeared above his head. With his current cultivation base, it was much stronger and faster. In an instant, it collided with the incoming small blue sword.The instant they collided, Xu Qing fiercely punched to the side, colliding with a clone that was rushing over. The clone was sent rolling back and was spitting blood.. Xu Qing instantly caught up and kneed the clone with all his strength.The sound of bones and flesh collapsing rang out as half of the clone's body exploded.Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of black fiendish fire, forming a sea of fire that enveloped another clone of the three fires sea corpse cultivator.When a mournful cry spread from the sea of fire, the third clone had already approached. This clone's eyes were filled with madness. The moment it got close, its body instantly rotted on its own. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  After it melted at a speed visible to the naked eye, it condensed into a black nail that flew toward Xu Qing's head."Interesting."A strange glint appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. The three fires old man had many methods, especially this black nail. The trace of soul suppressing power from it caused Xu Qing to feel a little surprised. He immediately lifted his right hand and grabbed the nail.The nail struggled intensely, but it was useless.The void in the distance distorted and the true body of the three fires cultivator was revealed. He immediately turned to escape. However, the instant he retreated, his body suddenly paused.At the next moment, his eyes revealed horror but a sinister laugh came from his mouth. He quickly ran a few steps and arrived in front of Xu Qing. He knelt on one knee and handed over his storage bag. After that, he broke his neck.Popping sounds echoed from his body. Seeing that the magic apertures were exploding, Xu Qing spread the fiendish fire over the old man, absorbing his soul. The Golden Crow had cleaned up the enemies and returned happily, sucking at the three fires cultivator's blood.The three fires cultivator's body trembled and the fear in his eyes turned into despair. At the next instant, his soul was extracted and his body withered. The qi and blood in his entire body were refined into a drop which then entered the Golden Crow's mouth.The shadow also had a full meal and was satisfied.Only the black iron stick was a little disappointed. An intense sense of danger rose in the Diamond Sect's ancestor's heart. No matter how he looked at it, he felt like he had become a little redundant.'This can't go on!!'The Diamond Sect's ancestor felt that if this continued, he would definitely not be able to escape the fate of becoming cannon fodder. He sensed the spirit liquid of the blood pool he had stored and decided to find a time to continue breaking through after they escaped.Both the shadow and the Golden Crow were gradually becoming stronger. That was the manifestation of the spirit liquid on their bodies. For example, the shadow could actually devour the shadow of a three fires cultivator now.The Golden Crow's abilities had clearly become even stronger. The enhancement it provided to Xu Qing's body was also continuing to increase."This trip was worth it!" Xu Qing took a deep breath and headed straight for the exit of the forbidden area. As he sped, he thought of the captain and sighed."To be chased by a Golden Core cultivator, the captain is indeed a ferocious person‚Ä¶" Xu Qing sighed. The danger was huge this time, but the captain had attracted most of the hatred. Otherwise, he felt that there would definitely be more people chasing after him now.He used all his strength to rush toward the exit. Just as he was about to reach the exit, Xu Qing's pupils contracted. Without waiting for instructions, the Diamond Sect's ancestor entered the exit vortex to check out the situation first.The shadow had clearly recovered a lot of its intelligence and also spread out.A look of admiration appeared in Xu Qing's eyes. Seeing the Diamond Sect's ancestor and shadow rushing out, he also mentally prepared himself. The cultivation base in his body was fully brewing at this moment.At the next instant, after sensing the situation outside through the shadow, Xu Qing was stunned. A hint of contemplation appeared in his eyes. A few breaths later, he gritted his teeth fiercely and stepped into the exit.

Chapter 269 Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child
"You're finally willing to come out?"Almost at the instant Xu Qing walked out of the vortex, he heard a voice coming from ahead.The other party's tone was calm and gave off no energy fluctuation.Xu Qing looked over. In reality, he had already seen the scene in front of him through the shadow earlier. However, now that he was seeing it with his own eyes, his heart still sank.There were originally more than a thousand Sea Corpse Race cultivators guarding this place. At this moment, these people were all kneeling from a distance.There was only one person outside the exit.This person was a youth. He wore a golden emperor's robe but he didn't have an emperor's crown. His skin was fair and there were no livor mortis spots. His aura was deep and profound and his eyes seemed to contain the stars.Appearance-wise, he was inferior to Xu Qing. However, the noble aura he emitted made him the center of attention wherever he was.He was sitting on a gigantic red lingzhi and coldly looking at Xu Qing. A ball of black fog floated beside him. The thing trapped in this fog was none other than the black iron stick.Clearly, the instant he rushed out earlier, the Diamond Sect's ancestor was captured alive by this person. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  As for the shadow, because it was special, it wasn't discovered. At that moment, it was hiding on the lingzhi and carefully spreading out, as though it wanted to get close and devour the other party's shadow."My name is Miao Chen. I'm a Dao Child of this generation of the Sea Corpse Race. Your companion is being chased by Elder Ying Ling. It's impossible for him to escape.""As for you, I was very curious about who dared to be so arrogant here, so I came out of seclusion to take a look.""I'm a little disappointed now, but your artifact spirit is still alright. Can you give it to me?" Miao Chen calmly asked.Xu Qing didn't say anything. He stood at the exit and sensed his surroundings. There was still some energy that restricted teleportation here. He had to head further out."You don't have to watch anymore. Although I don't know how you plan to escape, it is meaningless because you will become my spoils of war today." Miao Chen looked at Xu Qing."You're very talkative." Xu Qing's gaze landed on the youth.When Miao Chen heard this, he stood up and laughed. His laughter grew louder and louder until it stirred up the energy in the surroundings, forming a resonance force that created a storm in the surroundings.This storm spread out, stirring up countless dust on the ground like an avalanche. It even swept the ghost dream butterflies out of this area.The violent wind stirred up Xu Qing's long hair and caused his clothes to flutter in the wind. It was as though the wind wanted to erase him but it was obvious that it couldn't do so.At most, it would only move his hair and clothes. It couldn't shake his body or obstruct his cold gaze.Xu Qing coldly glanced at the imposing youth in front of him and suddenly rushed out toward the youth.The life lantern in his body burned and his life fires were ignited. The Golden Crow totemic tattoo on his back emitted heat. With the enhancement of his physical strength, his speed was astonishing. He directly broke through all the wind obstacles in front of him and arrived in front of Miao Chen. He then punched out fiercely.This punch contained the shadow of the Golden Crow, the power of Fiendish Fire Soul Devouring Art, and the monstrous might brought about by his body that was like a blazing continent.As the punch landed, rumbling sounds rang out in all directions, directly smashing into Miao Chen's chest.Miao Chen's eyes were filled with disdain. Just as he was about to wave his hand, the lingzhi below him suddenly turned from red to black. One eye after another opened in this blackness.The opening and closing of these eyes formed a strange force that caused Miao Chen's movements to pause.At the same time, the black iron stick that the Diamond Sect's ancestor was on suddenly shone with lightning runes. He directly destroyed a few lightning runes for more power.It broke through the black fog and rushed out, heading straight for the youth's neck at an astonishing speed. There was also a series of mind-stirring bell chimes that rang from the stick.Clearly, the Diamond Sect's ancestor had been trapped earlier because he had been laying out a trap of his own. It wasn't that he couldn't escape, but he wanted to wait for Xu Qing to attack before showing his strength at the most critical moment.At that moment, when he acted together with the shadow and Xu Qing, his might was truly astonishing.Miao Chen's expression changed for the first time. He couldn't dodge Xu Qing's punch. At the critical moment, his body suddenly swayed and a palm-sized jade coffin instantly appeared above his head. As soon as the coffin appeared, treasure light shone and flowed down like water, permeating the surroundings of the youth, forming a protective barrier. Xu Qing's fist landed on this protective barrier.An earth-shattering boom echoed out. As Miao Chen's body rolled back like a kite with a broken string, the Diamond Sect's ancestor chased after him and stabbed fiercely. Although he didn't pierce through the protective barrier, the lightning spread in and bombarded Miao Chen's entire body.The shadow also appeared behind Miao Chen. The tree shadow formed a blurry outline and opened its mouths to suck fiercely. Immediately, a lot of anomalous substances exited from Miao Chen's entire body.This wasn't the end. Xu Qing rushed over again, punching out one punch after another at Miao Chen's protective barrier. The heavenly saber manifested and slashed ruthlessly.Miao Chen's body was thrown a thousand feet away and created a deep pit when he landed. The expressions of the kneeling sea corpse cultivators in the distance shook. Just as they were about to approach, a furious roar rang out from the deep pit."All of you, back off. I will handle this!"As this furious roar rang out, a ball of life fire fluctuations suddenly flickered from the deep pit. A figure walked out. His hair was disheveled and his eyes revealed intense killing intent. As he walked out, the second ball of life fire in his body was ignited.After that, the third ball of life fire and the fourth ball of life fire were instantly ignited.As a Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race, he had opened 120 magic apertures, forming four balls of life fire.Such a heaven's chosen should usually be at the critical moment of breaking through. Coupled with his previous words, it could be seen that he was originally in closed-door cultivation. However, such a major event had happened in the Sea Corpse Race. Clearly, there weren't enough people left. Or perhaps it was because of his curiosity that he came.However, he didn't expect Xu Qing to combine his attacks with strange methods to suppress him immediately. This caused him to feel a little embarrassed, so he erupted in full force.The instant he erupted, Xu Qing's figure approached again. Under the burning of his life lantern, he possessed the cultivation of three fires. Coupled with Golden Crow Refines All Life, Xu Qing's true combat strength had reached four fires.He attacked again and suppressed the youth who walked out of the deep pit.As a Dao Child, Miao Chen was naturally extraordinary. With a wave of his hand, droplets of black liquid instantly formed around him. In the blink of an eye, they gathered into a black sea that swept fiercely toward Xu Qing.RUMBLEThe churning black sea formed a large mouth that fiercely devoured Xu Qing.Killing intent flashed in Xu Qing's eyes but he knew that he couldn't stay here for long. Hence, without any hesitation, the spirit sea in his 65 magic apertures erupted and directly spread out outside his body, forming a magic power pool with a range of 10,000 feet.Relying on his dense magic power, he ruthlessly suppressed the youth.The black sea formed by the youth's spell instantly collapsed. Xu Qing's magic power pool also dissipated. At the next instant, four fires burned ferociously in the youth's body and he suddenly appeared in front of Xu Qing, grabbing at his heart.Xu Qing dodged slightly then kneed the youth.At the next instant, the black iron stick whistled over from the side. All the lightning runes on it shone and another ten or so exploded. It suddenly appeared in front of Miao Chen and stabbed his neck.Miao Chen's expression changed. Just as he was about to dodge, the shadow pounced up from the ground again.Xu Qing also erupted with speed. The fiendish fire in his body rose as he slammed his palm toward Miao Chen's forehead.At this critical moment, Miao Chen let out a low roar. The power of the four balls of life fire in his body spread out with all their might, forming a powerful impact force and suppression of the cultivation base, causing the Diamond Sect's ancestor to let out a blood-curdling cry and roll back. Xu Qing was also the first to receive the brunt of the force.. His internal organs shook and killing intent flashed in his eyes.The shadow was also scattered by this force, but there was still a wisp that touched the youth's body and infiltrated his body. It arrived at his dantian and pounced toward a ball of life fire like it had extinguished the Spirit Breath Lantern back then.As it pounced over, the ball of life fire instantly swayed and showed signs of extinguishing.The mind of the Dao Child shook violently. The life fires in his body erupted and even the Heavenly Palace faintly appeared to suppress the shadow as he tried to stop the life fire from being extinguished.He was not able to care about other things which gave Xu Qing a chance.The coldness in Xu Qing's eyes flared up at this moment. In such a life-and-death battle, he couldn't care less about exposing himself. The Golden Crow formed behind him and as black flames surged into the sky and pressed down on the Dao Child of the Sea Corpse Race.The Golden Crow behind him let out a shocking cry and also pounced over. The moment Miao Chen was aware of the danger, black flames covered him and sucked fiercely at his head!Refine!Xu Qing was prepared to use the opportunity exchanged by the shadow to refine the other party alive!The two of them attacked incomparably quickly. Outsiders couldn't see their movements clearly at all. The Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child seemed to be suppressed but he was actually extremely strong. Xu Qing had to use all his methods to obtain this decisive opportunity.When experts fought, being able to see and create the decisive opportunity was extremely important.Following the ruthlessness in Xu Qing's eyes and the devouring by Golden Crow Refines All Life, the Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child let out a mournful cry. For the first time, horror appeared in his eyes. He clearly felt that his qi and blood were being extracted and his head was melting.This was indeed the case. From afar, the qi and blood of the Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child were spreading out. And, his right face that was facing the Golden Crow was indeed melting!His right ear had disappeared and the right side of his face was completely disfigured!This scene caused the expressions of the sea corpse cultivators in the distance to change. They couldn't care less about the Dao Child's instructions and rushed over.

Chapter 270 Slipping Away
However, they were some distance away and couldn't arrive in time.At this critical moment, the Dao Child let out a low roar and took out that jade coffin again. The coffin opened; a sea of light spread from it and a finger stretched out.As soon as this finger appeared, it directly pointed in front of Xu Qing.An intense sense of danger rose in Xu Qing's mind. He retreated immediately without any hesitation. The Sea Corpse Race's Dao Child finally caught his breath and quickly retreated, trying to distance himself.However, the Diamond Sect's ancestor, who had suffered consecutively, was anxious at this moment. He saw that the shadow had made many contributions in this incident. This gave him a strong sense of urgency. He felt that if this continued, he would definitely be discarded.His eyes were bloodshot. He roared and didn't hesitate to sacrifice several lightning runes in exchange for extreme speed. His speed soared and he instantly pierced through the arm of the panicked Dao Child.Blood gushed out and the Dao Child's expression changed drastically. As for the Diamond Sect's ancestor, he quickly retreated and returned excitedly.From afar, the two people on the battlefield were retreating. However, compared to the sorry state of the Dao Child, Xu Qing looked to be in a much better state.However, he wasn't arrogant. He was very clear that Miao Chen's combat strength was definitely not just these. It was just that he had snatched the initiative; his storm-like attacks, the strangeness of the shadow, and the strength of the body refined by Golden Crow Refines All Life caused Miao Chen to fall into danger almost instantly.Although it was a pity that he couldn't kill the other party, Xu Qing understood that he couldn't stay anymore.As he retreated, his speed erupted as he sped into the distance. The shadow and the black iron stick also got close and fled together.As for the sea corpse cultivators who had rushed over from the surroundings, more than half of them stayed with the Dao Child. The remaining portion was about to chase after Xu Qing but after taking a few steps, they spat out blood as the poison that Xu Qing had scattered took effect.Dao Child Miao Chen, who was also poisoned, was protected by the Sea Corpse Race cultivators. He angrily pushed away the surrounding sea corpse cultivators. His eyes were filled with killing intent and the grievance he felt reached the extreme.When he was alive, he was a heaven's chosen of the Spirit Jade Race. He sensed 120 magic apertures and transformed into a sea corpse after he died in an accident. He was also valued by the Sea Corpse Race and was listed in King's Sequence. Under their full nurturing, he finally stepped into the four fires realm.It could be said that regardless of whether it was the Spirit Jade or the Sea Corpse Race, he had never suffered such humiliation other than the time he died. The right side of his face was disfigured and his right ear had melted. This caused him, who cared a lot about the appearance, to be seething with madness and anger."I'm going to kill you!" The Dao Child touched the right side of his face. The fires in his body burned violently as he gave chase.Xu Qing, who was in the distance, turned his head and narrowed his eyes. Just as he was about to attack again, his expression changed.In the distant sky, three energy fluctuations erupted into the sky. The strength of these auras surpassed the Foundation Building realm. They were Golden Core experts of the Sea Corpse Race. There were a total of three of them who were rushing over from the horizon.Their energy fluctuations caused the weather itself to change. It was like the anger of the heavens, wanting to punish all living beings.Xu Qing took a deep breath. The sense of danger spread out from every inch of his flesh. He didn't stop at all and circulated his cultivation base fully. He fled even faster and ran into the distance.At the same time, there was also an explosion behind him and a faint roar echoed through the area."Thief, I don't believe that a mere invisibility technique of yours can escape the search of my Sea Corpse Race!!"Xu Qing was familiar with this furious roar. It was none other than the Golden Core boy who had chased after the captain earlier. From his words, it was obvious that the captain had actually escaped from his pursuit.‚Äã This caused Xu Qing to have more guesses about the captain's identity and cultivation base. At the same time, he became even more anxious. He was very clear that the captain was treated as the chief culprit and had attracted the attention of countless people. Once the captain wasn't found, he would be the target of all this attention.Xu Qing looked at the black iron stick. n0(ùïß(e)lbiùïü.n(et  The Diamond Sect's ancestor in the black iron stick didn't hesitate at all. At the next instant, another seven to eight lightning runes on the iron stick exploded in exchange for an even faster speed. He dragged Xu Qing and rushed forward with all his might.With the help of the Diamond Sect's ancestor, Xu Qing escaped much faster. In an instant, he crossed a thousand feet and directly stepped out of the edge of the forbidden area to the outside world.The Golden Core boy behind him roared angrily. When the divine senses of the Golden Core experts swept in all directions with terrifying fluctuations, Xu Qing didn't hesitate at all to activate the disorder teleportation talisman.In the blink of an eye, Xu Qing's figure blurred. At the next moment, a cold snort rang out from the distant sky.It was a three-headed and six-armed sea corpse. His Golden Core energy fluctuation was extremely powerful, surpassing that of the Golden Core boy.From such a far distance, he pointed at Xu Qing."Restrict!"As soon as he spoke, the space around Xu Qing was sealed. However, the disorder teleportation talisman was an extremely powerful item. It ignored the restriction of the Golden Core and was still operating. In fact, the teleportation fluctuations had already formed and it was about to teleport Xu Qing away."Hmm?" The eyes of the Golden Core sea corpse cultivator in the distant sky narrowed. He quickly took out a bead and crushed it!"Break!"As soon as he finished speaking, the disorder teleportation talisman in Xu Qing's hand couldn't withstand it anymore. The bead seemed to have linked with the talisman; when it broke, the teleportation talisman was also destroyed. Xu Qing was enveloped by the divine ability from the Golden Core sea corpse cultivator.This force contained the intent to destroy everything, causing the flesh in Xu Qing's body to feel like they were about to tear apart and wither.Xu Qing's eyes turned bloodshot as he took out another disorder teleportation talisman and activated it.He had a total of three disorder teleportation talismans. He had used one of them on the dragon carriage and one of them had been broken earlier. Now, this was the last one.At the same time, his magic ship manifested to block the force. At the next instant, his magic ship collapsed and shattered into pieces. However, the trace of Blinding flesh inside still blocked the will of extermination, causing the attack that was supposed to kill him to turn into a serious injury.Xu Qing spat out a mouthful of blood as the bones in his body shattered. The life fires in his body were instantly extinguished and his entire body withered like it was rotting. He was also directly thrown up by this huge force. Many parts of his body collapsed and shattered. His soul was unstable as well.However, with this obstruction, his last disorder teleportation talisman was also exchanged for an opportunity to teleport. Although the Golden Core cultivator who was rapidly approaching attacked again, Xu Qing's disorder teleportation talisman was given to him by the Deputy Peak Lord of the Seventh Peak. It was an item refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator and had its own extraordinary points.At that moment, when he used it twice in a row and his figure was covered in blood, the teleportation power erupted explosively and Xu Qing's body instantly disappeared!Almost at the instant he disappeared, the Golden Core expert descended and landed at the place where Xu Qing had disappeared, causing a deep pit to appear on the ground. The surrounding area shook intensely."Two teleportation talismans refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator. This person's identity is definitely extraordinary. However, he has been hit by my Spirit Nether Curse, and with his cultivation base, he will definitely die in three days at most!" The expression of the Golden Core expert was ugly. He turned and headed straight for the forbidden area.While the Sea Corpse Race searched crazily in the vicinity, a slight distortion appeared in the empty space in the distance.That distorted place looked like there was nothing there, but in reality, the person hiding inside was none other than the captain.His entire body was covered in injuries and one of his arms was already crippled. There was also a huge wound at his waist that was about to split him into two, causing his aura to be extremely weak.He was holding a rainbow-colored shell in his remaining hand. The rainbow light emitted by the shell had a miraculous concealment effect, causing his existence and aura to disappear without a trace.This was also the captain's way to escape the pursuit of the Golden Core cultivators. However, at this moment, he was a little dumbfounded.He had watched helplessly as Xu Qing crushed the disorder teleportation talisman and left. Originally, he wanted to come over and greet him but the scene he saw caused his mind to tremble."Gone? Gone? Teleported away? I‚Ä¶"The captain suddenly wailed inwardly. He felt that this matter had become a little strange. He had only taken a bite, but why did the statue's nose explode?In reality, even now, he still felt that this matter was unbelievable. It wasn't that he hadn't suspected Xu Qing, but it just so happened that the nose exploded right after he took the bite, causing him to feel this was possibly related to him."The old man didn't say that it would be like this. Back then, he didn't do such a big thing‚Ä¶" The captain let out a long sigh. As he frowned and carefully fled, pride rose in his heart."However, this matter can also indirectly mean that I'm better than the old man. This‚Ä¶ was exciting!"The captain took a deep breath and felt smug. Rumbling sounds filled the sky and the auras of Golden Core cultivators erupted. Even energy fluctuations from Nascent Soul cultivators appeared.This caused the captain to instantly lower his head. He lay on the ground and moved bit by bit. On one hand, he had to hide. On the other hand, he was also afraid that his movements would be too big and he would really split in two‚Ä¶"At worst, I'll leave half of my body behind‚Ä¶"Three days passed.As this matter fermented, the entire Sea Corpse Race was completely enraged and searched crazily in all directions. To the Sea Corpse Race, this matter was extremely humiliating.This was because the scene that the Golden Core boy was most worried about had happened.Even after three days had passed, the nose of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue still didn't recover.At that moment, the Golden Core boy was standing in front of the Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue with his head lowered. Beside him stood a middle-aged cultivator.This middle-aged cultivator wasn't a human. He had two wings on his back and his aura was restrained. However, as he stood there, the Golden Core boy at the side shook incomparably."Marquis Anzuo, I‚Ä¶""Ying Ling, the king is furious." The middle-aged cultivator lifted his head and stared at the statue that looked extremely odd due to not having the nose. He also stared at the actions of the few sea corpse cultivators who were probing and trying to repair it.The Golden Core boy's body trembled even more intensely.Not long later, the sea corpse cultivators at the nose of the statue arrived in front of Marquis Anzuo with grievance and helplessness and respectfully spoke."Marquis, the destruction is very strange. We are unable to repair it, maybe there is hope if we can get back the two missing pieces."Marquis Anzuo fell silent. After a long time, he spoke softly."What you mean is that one of the holy objects of our Sea Corpse Race, this Seventh Ancestral Corpse Statue will have to show its noseless appearance in front of all our clansmen from now on, is that right?"
